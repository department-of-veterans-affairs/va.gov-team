# Initiative Brief Template
#### Overview

<details>
 
 *There is roughly a 1:many relationship between products and initiatives, or our attempts to improve a product/achieve Veteran outcomes. The same goes for product outlines and initiative briefs. This template can be used as product documentation for the Collaboration Cycle, especially when iterating an existing product. In addition, the Brief is an important communication tool within a team and between the team and Crew Chief/PO/other teams.*

## Outcome Summary
> *Brief statement describing opportunity you're pursuing e.g. "Increase Use of Search Tools on VA.gov." Include measurable outcome (i.e. metric) you're trying to affect.*
* Take the non-compliant legacy system Web Automated Verification of Enrollment (WAVE) on PITC (a local server) and move it Verify Your Enrollment (VYE) on VA.gov.

## Problem
> *Describe the challenge / pain point you seek to address.:* (1) WAVE is non-compliant with current U.S. government regulations because it uses JavaScript; (2) WAVE data also lives on PITC, a local server, instead of on VA.gov; (3) Current WAVE functionality is not condusive to veterans with disabilities; (4) Nearly the entire administrative portion of WAVE is not functional or provides unnecessary/impertinent information to the business.
* *What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?* WAVE is currently non-compliant because it uses JavaScript, which is no longer sanctioned by the U.S. goverment because of data security concerns. This is a problem because WAVE holds veterans' personally identifiable information. Evidence exists in current U.S. policy and memorandums from the U.S. Congress. Moving from WAVE to VYE will primarily effect veterans who are entitled to benefits under Chapter 33 of the post-9/11 GI bill, it can also affect the VA and other teams contracted through the VA, such as the Veteran Readiness and Employment Product Sustainment and Enhancement Services Team, who use information from WAVE for their work. The administrative portion of WAVE affects people at the VA who need access to the amount of veterans who verified their enrollment, how many veterans access the website, and similar information. Evidence of the problem exists in use of the application itself: when attemping to browse the administrative portion of WAVE, the VYE team experienced a lack of functionality. Evidence also exists in the EDU Team's lack of access to proper information, since it does not provide dates past 1999.
* *Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?* The problem occurs because WAVE has not been updated - coding, the look and feel of the website, functions of the website, etc. - in nearly 10 years, meaning the system is archaic and can be difficult or confusing to use. Usage difficulties are problematic because they act as a barrier for veterans seeking to access their education benefits, especially for veterans with disabilities who require modern technological assistance. 
* *How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?* Modernizing WAVE and moving it to VA.gov aligns with OCTO-DE's mission to update VA applications, create the best experience for all veterans by streamlining the process to receive education benefits, and provide a seamless veteran experience through the delivery of state-of-the-art technology by improving the functionality and experience of the application.

## Desired User Outcomes
> *Describe the desired user outcomes:*
* *Why would a user want to use this?* A veteran would want to use this because the streamlined application allows them more quicker and easier access to their Chapter 33 education benefits. 
* *With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?* In VYE users should be able to confirm their enrollment information without having to wade through unnecessary information pages, like the one that asks for change of address or change of login information, that already live on other parts of VA.gov. This will allow users a streamlined experience that excludes unnecessary questions. 

## Undesired User Outcomes
> *Describe the undesired user outcomes:* 
* Increased hardship to access benefits for veterans.
* Lack of accessability for disabled veterans.
* Lack of access to data analytics information for the EDU Team at the VA.
* Inability to confirm enrollment.
## Desired Business Outcomes
> *Describe the desired business outcomes:*
* 

- *Why would your business want this to exist?*
- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
> ðŸ’¡ *VA.gov products measure success against Ease of use, Service Completion, Trust/Satisfaction, Health.*<sup>1</sup>\
> ðŸ’¡ *Identify balancing metrics to ensure you're not bringing about undesired outcomes.*

- WAVE does not have KPIs | Baseline | Target | VYE Team plans to leverage Google Analytics and Domo through VA.gov to capture data.

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks. Inspired by [SVPG's Four Big Risks](https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/).*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - .
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - .
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Examples:
    - Upstream/Downstream API/Data availability and reliability
    - Site performance impacts (see [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/), #-daily-lighthouse-scan)
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Examples: 
    - VA stakeholder testing, marketing, compliance requirements
