# Accredited Representative Facing Team Agreements

As the ARF Team, we agree to the below way of working:

1. We write down asynchronous stand-up updates in the team channel every workday in the agreed-upon format.
2. We discuss blockers or items needing clarification in the follow-on stand-up meeting.
3. We follow the agreed-upon format for Zenhub issues to maintain consistency and clarity.
4. We break down work so it's achievable within a sprint, ensuring manageable and realistic goals.
5. We strive to deliver the work we've set for a sprint within the sprint timeline to maintain momentum and meet commitments.
6. We attend sprint planning meetings with refined issues, prepared and ready for productive discussion.
7. We give timely and constructive feedback on sprint presentations before sprint review meetings to enhance the quality of our output.
8. We respond to any inquiry within team channels within 3 hours (during core hours)
9. We commit to regular retrospectives for continuous improvement, adapting our approach based on collective insights and agreements.
