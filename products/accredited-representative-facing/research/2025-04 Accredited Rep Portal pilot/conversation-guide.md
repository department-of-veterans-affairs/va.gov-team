## Intro (5 min)
Thanks for joining us today! My name is \[name\] and I’m a researcher with the team in the VA’s Chief Technology Office. Our team is focused on building tools for accredited representatives.

- ~~\[If pilot participant\] We met briefly during the meet and greet a few weeks ago. Thank you for participating in the pilot. Today we are hoping to learn more about your experience thus far using the new portal to review power of attorney requests. We’ll be asking you to walk through how you are using the portal. Then, we have a few new concepts that we will share for your feedback.~~
- \[If non-pilot participant\] Today we are going to ask you to give feedback on a prototype of a new website portal for accredited representatives that helps representatives receive and respond to power of attorney requests.

We have a few other people on the line today taking notes and observing.

\[Have others come off-camera to introduce themselves\]

Before we start, a few things I have a few things to mention:

- The entire session should take **about an hour**.
- In this session, we want to hear your **honest opinions**. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- Your **participation is entirely voluntary**, and you can stop the session at any time for any reason.
- ~~\[If pilot participant\] For part of the session today, we will have you~~ **~~share your screen~~** ~~so that we can see what you are doing in the Accredited Representative Portal. We are all in a secure environment so it should be ok to show PII.~~
- \[if non-pilot participant\] For part of the session today, we will have you share your screen so we can follow along with how you use the prototype. If you are not able, we can share our screen and walk through the prototype that way.
- We would like to **record our session** if that’s OK with you; we use the recordings for team members who were not able to be with us today and also to go back if our notes are unclear. We will not share any part of the video outside of our team without your permission and we have practices in place to safeguard any PII and PHI we may record. The findings we report will not include your name or any attributions to you.

Is it ok with you if we record this session?

\[Start recording\]

OK, the recording has started. Just so we have it on record, is it OK for us to record our session?

## Part 1: \[If non-pilot participant\] POA request user testing (20 min)

Let’s say the VA releases a new portal for accredited representatives to receive and review power of attorney requests online.

- What is your reaction to this announcement?
- What expectations do you have for this tool?

For this session, we will be sharing a link to a prototype of this new portal. The prototype is not the real website and it may not function exactly the way you expect. Some parts are clickable and some are not.

Figma prototype link: <https://tinyurl.com/5ec75263>

<https://www.figma.com/proto/LVCQBuW7a6nfVFNyhA4kv4/ARF---Form-21-22-Design-Explorations?node-id=6240-704563&p=f&t=HnDRfC54Fz8c0iZ1-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=6080%3A808590&starting-point-node-id=6240%3A704563>

We’re going to go through a few different scenarios. I’d like you to think aloud as you go through the activity. Tell us what you are seeing, if it's what you expect to see, and especially tell us about anything that is confusing or unclear.

### Task 1: Accept/Decline \[Full authorization\]

Let’s pretend that you are working with **Vanessa Harris**. Vanessa submitted a power of attorney request online to appoint you as their representative. You want to review the request and then either accept or decline the request. You log into the new accredited representative portal to do this. The prototype will start on the page you will see upon logging in.

What would you do from this page? Remember to think aloud and especially note anything that is not clear.

Why did you \[accept or decline\] the request?

Now that you have \[accepted/declined\] the POA request, what would you do next in working with a Veteran?

### Task 2: Accept/Decline \[Partial authorization\]

\[Note: do not redirect participant back to POA requests page\]

Let’s pretend that you are working with **Logan Johnson**. Logan submitted a power of attorney request online to appoint you as their representative. You want to review the request and then either accept or decline the request.

What would you do from this page? Remember to think aloud and especially note anything that is not clear.

Why did you \[accept or decline\] the request?

Now that you have \[accepted/declined\] the POA request, what would you do next in working with a Veteran?

### Task 3: Find POA acceptance date

\[Note: do not redirect participant back to POA requests page\]

Let’s pretend that a Veteran, **Austin Williams**, you are working with called to ask if you accepted the POA request they submitted last week. You remember accepting their request but you’d like to reassure them by giving them the exact date you accepted.

Walk me through how you would find the date that you accepted the POA request?

### Task 4: Direct a Veteran to submit a POA request online

Let’s pretend that a Veteran wants to appoint you as their representative. You want to use the portal to review and accept their request. How would you instruct the claimant to submit their POA request?

\[Success path: participant recognizes the instructions on the homepage or POA requests page\]

How do Veterans you work with submit the 21-22 today?

- For POA requests to populate in the new portal we are planning, Veterans will need to have a login.gov or ID.me account, complete and submit the form online. What is your reaction to this approach?

### Post-Task Questions \[skip to notifications section if already covered\]

- \[List page\] What are your general impressions about the POA requests page?
  - Is there anything that could be improved about this page?
  - Is there anything on this page that is confusing? Why?
  - Can you think of anything that would help you find the requests you are looking for more easily?
- \[Details page\] What are your general impressions about the page with the details of a POA request?
  - Is there anything that could be improved about this page?
  - Is there anything on this page that is confusing?
  - What additional information would you want to see here?
  - \[have them open a pending request\] What was your initial reaction when you saw this list of accept and decline options?
    - Does this list make sense to you? Are there options that do not make sense?
    - Are there other reasons that you decline POA?
    - Do you think it is useful to ask for a decline reason? Why or why not?
    - What information do you think is shared with the Veteran and why? What would you prefer to be shared with them?
  - Did you notice the blue banner on this page after submitting your decision? Did you read the information in this banner?
    - \[If yes\] Tell us in your own words what it is trying to tell you
    - \[If no\] Go ahead and read the instructions now. Tell us in your own words what is trying to tell you.
- JUMP TO HERE We are considering adding a notifications feature to the portal.
  - What activities in the portal would you like to be notified about? \[new requests, accepted/declined requests\]
  - We are considering a bulk email digest. You would receive one email per day that lists out all new requests to any of your accredited organizations. It would also list acceptances and declines as well. What is your reaction to this approach?
  - How would you want to be notified differently? \[frequency, method, content\]
- How does this process of receiving and reviewing POA requests compare to what you do today? Is it better, worse or the same? \[Mark response\] Why?
- \[If cross accredited\] Does it matter to you which of your organizations you accept POA under?
- Anything else you would like to share about this before we move on?

## Part 2: Concept testing (15 min)

\[[Link to concepts in Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/LVCQBuW7a6nfVFNyhA4kv4/ARF---Form-21-22-Design-Explorations?node-id=6037-199792&p=f&t=L1G5FOeVG4IoCma4-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=4509%3A117847&starting-point-node-id=6037%3A199792&show-proto-sidebar=1)\]

Great. Now we are going to look at some concepts that we would like your input on. I will share my screen and ask you some questions. What you will be looking at is not a real website and does not include any real data about Veterans. This conversation is to help us make decisions about how to improve the portal in the future.

### \[if cross-accredited rep\] Concept 1 – VSO switch

- You’ll notice there is a dropdown menu at the top of the page. It is currently set to “All” but I can change it to a specific Veteran Service Organization. \[show dropdown\]
- What do you expect changing the selection will do?
  - \[show change to American Legion\]
- What is your reaction to this functionality?
- Can you think of situations when you would use this functionality? Why or why not?

### Concept 2 – Search/filter

- This is the power of attorney requests page you saw earlier, with some additional features.
- What do you notice that is different about this version of the page?
- What is your reaction to the filters section of the page?
  - Can you think of any situations when you would use any of these filters? Which ones? Why or why not?
  - Can you think of additional ways you would want to filter POA requests?
  - \[show filter by American Legion, VFW, and Veteran\]
  - Comparing this method of filtering by VSO to the method you saw on the prior screen, which do you prefer?
- What is your reaction to the search field under Search POA requests?
  - Can you think of any situations when you would use this search field?
  - How would you use it?
  - \[show filter by zipcode\]

### Concept 3 – Search Claimants

- \[Start on search/filter concept\]
  - Did you notice the link “search by claimant information”?
  - What do you expect to see on clicking on this link?
- \[go to search claimants\]
- Let’s pretend you enter information about an individual in all of these fields.
  - On clicking search, what information would you expect to see?
  - \[If they do not read the text, have them read the text and explain what they think they would see\]
- Can you think of situations when you would use this functionality? Can you think of situations when you would use this search?

Thank you for your input on those concepts.

Before we close, I’d like to ask about your ideal portal experience. If you had a magic wand and could have any features you want in an accredited representative portal, what would those be?

## Part 3: Closing (5 min)

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the accredited representative portal.

\[For non-pilot participants\] To give you some more context into our work, our team is working on building a new accredited representative portal and it is currently in the pilot phase. We are starting with POA requests and will be adding additional features in the future, like being able to submit ITF and claims via the portal. If you think your organization might be interested in participating in the pilot, you can speak with your leadership and have them email us at [RepresentativePortalHelp@va.gov](mailto:RepresentativePortalHelp@va.gov) \[post in chat\].

Do you have any questions about this initiative? Do you have any thoughts or advice for our team before we wrap up?

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

- We are interested in talking to representatives who are responsible for accepting and declining POA requests. Since you do not handle POA, I’d like to end the session early today. What I will do is update our database with this information. We would love to include you in future studies focused on other functionality.
- Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.

## Service Recovery

Many VSO reps are also Veterans themselves. If they are showing signs of crisis, refer them to the Veterans Crisis Line. Dial 988 then Press 1, or or Text 838255. <https://www.veteranscrisisline.net/>
