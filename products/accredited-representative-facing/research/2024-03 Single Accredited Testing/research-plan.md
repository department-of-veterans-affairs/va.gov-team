# Research Plan for ARF Team, Accredited Representative Portal, Single Accredited VSOfficers, 21-22 Accept/Decline User Testing, 03/2024

## Background

The Accredited Representative Facing Team is seeking to re-envision the Accredited Representative experience so that they can more seamlessly and accurately help Veterans with their VA interactions, including helping Veterans apply for, manage, and update their VA benefits.

Our initial focus is on the process of accepting the power of attorney (POA) given in Form 21-22 which appoints a Veterans Service Organization (VSO) as a Veteran’s representative, giving them POA.

### OCTO Priorities

**Grow digital submissions** / Focus on the needs of accredited representatives, and the Veterans who work with them: After years of focusing exclusively on Veterans who want to interact directly with VA, we will build tools for Veterans who want to work with accredited representatives, and the reps who support those Veterans. In doing so, we will redirect to VA.gov traffic currently going through eBenefits and Stakeholder Enterprise Portal (SEP).

Full list of [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md).

### Veteran Journey

Any/all points when a Veteran needs support filing and accessing their benefits.

## Research Goals
- Understand the usability of the **single accredited Veteran Service Officer** Accredited Representative (ARP) 21-22 flow on desktop.
- Information about current POA process and caseload will help determine improvements to the authenticated landing page and POA views to decrease cognitive load and facilitate smoother decision making.

### Outcome
* User testing will inform adjustments to the ARP 21-22 flow to improve usability.
* Feedback about the unauthenticated and authenticated ARP tool will inform content strategy and exploration of additional functionality required for ARP v1.

### Research questions
- Is the purpose and audience for the ARP landing page clear? Is the content valuable or is anything missing?
- Does the sign-in experience meet VSOffs expectations?
- What information is most valuable to VSOffs on the authenticated landing page? Is any information missing?
- Are navigation categories within ARP clear?
- Are there any challenges with finding and accepting a specific Veteran’s 21-22 request?
- Is information about the Veteran/claimant sufficient for making a decision about a 21-22 request? Is there any information missing?
- What functionality is missing from the 21-22 accept/decline flow?

### Hypotheses
- File number and SSN will be the most desired Veteran search functions
- VSOffs want visibility into the system working, such as confirmation an accepted 21-22 has been processed and they now have access to the e-Folder

## Methodology

**Semi-structured interviews** / The interviewer will ask the representative a series of questions to understand users’ current 21-22 process, from filling it out to submission, with a focus on understanding current pain points and mental models. 

**Usability testing** / Accredited representatives will be asked to engage with a prototype of Accredited Representative Portal (ARP) to test usability, understandability of content, and desirability of features.

### Location

## Recruitment
Our target audience is 8 Veterans Service Officers (with expectations of speaking to 5) who are accredited through a single Veterans Service Organization (VSOrg) and whose primary role is to work directly with Veterans and claimants. Our goal is to have an even split between junior and more senior or experienced VSOffs.

### Recruitment approach
Recruitment for this study will focus on Veterans Service Officers (VSOffs) who are accredited with a single Veterans Service Organization (VSOrg). Our understanding is that the majority of singly accredited VSOffs are employed through a Big 6 VSOrg. Understanding how these officers differ from those who hold multiple accreditations may uncover differences in work flows that the ARP tool will need to account for. 

**Recruitment criteria**

3-4 VSOffs from each group, ideally 8 Officers total

Primary criteria (must-haves)
- Mixture of novice and experienced users
- Accredited through a single Veterans Service Organization
- Must work in a role that primarily interacts with Veterans and claimants

Secondary criteria
