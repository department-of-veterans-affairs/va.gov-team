## Intro - 5 minutes

Hi [NAME], thanks for joining us today! How’s your day going so far?

_Wait for response_

My name is [NAME] and I’m a researcher working on creating accredited representative-facing tools on VA.gov so Veterans Service Officers like yourself can better support Veterans. [NAME] will be joining us to take notes.

Before we get started a few things I want to mention:

- **This session should take about an hour and fifteen minutes.** We’ll be focusing on your experiences as an accredited representative working with Veterans. The first part will be me asking you questions and learning more about your experiences, then after that it will be more interactive where you will be sharing your screen and giving us feedback for a mockup of a digital tool and running through some scenarios where you might use the tool. 
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions to improve digital tools so that they better meet accredited representatives’ needs.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback. I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation is completely voluntary.** If for any reason you want to stop, or do not want to answer a question, please let me know. 
- **During today's interview, we may discuss experiences that have caused serious frustration.** I do want to know about those experiences in case there are processes we can improve in the future, but they are not experiences I can help with directly. 
- **Knowing this, I have [#] teammates in the waiting room on Zoom who would like to observe our session, but only if you're comfortable.** Would that be okay, or do you prefer to keep the session to just the [#] of us?
    - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    - If yes: Admit observers.
    - Then, ask the observer(s) to give a brief, camera-on introduction, first name and position with VA.gov.
    - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observer(s) to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.
- **Are you ok if I record my screen and audio as we talk today for analysis and reporting purposes?** We like to record to make sure we’ve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at the VA to show user feedback. If we do this, we don’t link anything you choose to share in the session to any information that identifies you, and we remove your face and name from any videos that we share.
    - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_Start recording in CAG. Enable record to cloud._

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Do I have permission to record my screen and the audio as we talk today for analysis and reporting purposes?

## First Task: Background Questions - 15 minutes

**_Role and Context_**

1. Let’s get started: what is your current role and what organization do you support? (Confirm they only support one organization). 
    1. _If cross-accredited: continue with interview questions, complete feedback of the unauthenticated and authenticated landing pages, ask the participant if they’d be interested in completing another session with more screens soon, end the call._
2. How long have you been working in your current role?
3. Would you mind reminding me, are you Active Duty or a Veteran?
4. How many Veterans do you typically support at any given time? How many cases?

**_Current POA process_**

5. Can you talk us through how you work with Veterans to fill out and submit a Form 21-22 for power of attorney?
6. What is your current process for accepting POA requests, either individually or as an organization?
    1. Do you or your organization currently use the Stakeholder Enterprise Portal (SEP) to accept POA requests? 
    2. Why/why not?
7. [OPTIONAL, skip for DAV] Do you ever decline power of attorney requests?
    1. If so, how recently have you done this?
    2. Why?
    3. Did you let the Veteran know you were declining their request?
    4. How did you communicate with them?

## Second Task: 21-22 Accept/Decline - 40 minutes

**_Intro and screen share setup_**

We’re going to switch topics to share a new tool with you that we’re working on for accredited representatives. 

To get started: 
- We’ll place a link in the chat for you to click on. **Notetaker copy/paste to chat**: [Link to prototypes](https://www.figma.com/proto/C3sdnDf8anVqXVdmiCWwq8/%F0%9F%9A%A7-Accredited-Rep-Facing?page-id=0%3A146&type=design&node-id=437-34553&viewport=104%2C1305%2C0.05&t=NPr6SMchXdOO5N4R-8&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=437%3A34553&hotspot-hints=0&hide-ui=1)
- When you have it up, share your screen by clicking the ‘Share Screen’ button at the bottom of Zoom.
- Heads up, this is not a real website, it’s in the early stages and very much a work in progress, which means some parts of the experience won’t work as expected. If you try to do something on the site and it doesn’t work, just let me know what you would expect to happen instead.
- Keep in mind, we want to hear your thoughts, so say anything that comes to mind as you go. 

**_Unauthenticated landing page_**

1. Without clicking on anything, take a moment to review this web page. What are your initial impressions?
2. Who do you think this website is for? What would you expect to do here?
3. What do you think you personally might do on this website, if anything?
4. Is there anything you’d expect to see here that you’re not seeing?
5. In the menu at the top, what would you expect to find under **About**?
6. In the menu at the top, what would you expect to find under **Resources**? 

**_Signing in and authentication experience_**

7. Do you have a PIV card that you use to log in to VA systems?
    1. _If not, explain that a PIV card is used to authenticate people to get access into some VA systems._
8. Let’s pretend you already have an account set up using your PIV card and assume that you have your PIV card connected to your computer. Go ahead and find the sign in and click it. Please stop before you enter your credentials.
    1. [_From sign-in page_] Which sign-in option would you use? Why?
    2. If they did not click on the Login.gov opt PIV login option: 
        1. Prompt them to click on it (it’s the only one that’s interactive in this prototype)
        1. Did you know that the PIV card login was available under login.gov?

**_Authenticated homepage impressions_**

1. This is the first page you see once signed in. Without clicking anything, take a moment to review the page. What are your initial impressions?
2. [_While still on the dashboard_] Do you feel confident you are signed in? How can you tell?
    1. What do you think of the information in this profile snapshot? [_direct user to top right corner if they do not find the snapshot on their own_]
    2. Is there anything else you’d expect to see in this dropdown?
3. [_If the user has not commented on the “Veterans can now digitally submit” warning at the top of the screen_] I wanted to draw your attention to the notice at the top of the screen. What are your impressions of this, and do you have any questions about this message?

**_POA content and features_**

4. If you were looking for a specific POA request or set of requests, what criteria would you use to find them in this system?
    1. [_If user does not reference Search feature_] Are there scenarios where search would come in handy? What would you want to search by? 
        1. When you’re accepting a PoA request, would you have a file number, or do you only get that information after you’ve accepted the request? 
        2. Would you want/expect to search by “Veteran name” or “Claimant name”?
5. [_Skip if participant has already given feedback from Q4_] I’d like to draw your attention to the table at the bottom of the page. Tell me what this means to you. What do you expect to see in this table?
    1. What does the phrase “Pending” mean to you? Do you have any thoughts about how long a POA request would sit under the “Pending” tab? What if this tab said “New” instead of “Pending”?
    2. [_If they do not mention the tabs_] What do the terms “Accepted” and “Declined” mean to you in this context? Do you think you would use them, and if so, what for?
6. Tell me your thoughts about the different columns of information presented in the table of requests.
7. Let’s imagine you’ve logged into this tool for the day to manage any incoming POA requests. Is there any information missing on this page that you’d like to see? 
8. [_If not covered earlier_] Scrolling back up a bit, what do the “**Need help**” and “**Provide feedback**” areas on the top right hand side of the screen mean to you?
    3. What would you expect to find in them?

_If cross-accredited, end session now._

**_Searching for POA requests_**

1. Let’s imagine a scenario where you spoke to a Veteran named **Paula Higashi** on the phone and she submitted a 21-22 online through VA.gov. This new tool allows you to accept that 21-22 and quickly establish power of attorney. I am going to paste their information into the chat for you to reference. 

    To start, you just want to view Paula’s request. Once you find her request and view it, **please stop before making a decision to accept or decline her request.** How would you do this? 

    1. [Moderator or Note taker: put Veteran name in chat for participants to use]
    2. Success criteria: participant uses search feature to find the specific Veteran and opens their request.
2. [On task completion or abandonment] Overall, on a scale of 1-7, where 1 is very difficult and 7 is very easy, how difficult or easy was this task (searching by name) to complete?
    1. Why did you rate this task a _#_?

**_Search criteria desirability_**

3. Is the search feature you just used valuable to you? Why?
    1. You might notice there’s a dash in the top right corner of the search bar. That allows you to hide the search feature. Do you prefer it to be open or collapsed by default?
4. What are other ways you’d like to search for a specific power of attorney requests?
    1. What if the Veteran was someone you already had power of attorney for? How would you like to search for them in this portal if you were, let’s say, able to work on their claims directly from this portal?

**_Claimant details page and accepting request_**

1. [From the Veteran details page]. Without clicking anything, tell me what you think of this page. Is this enough information or the right information for you to know if you would accept or decline this request? 
    1. If not, what other information would be valuable? 
2. Go ahead and accept Paula’s request.
    1. Is this what you expected to happen?
3. [_On task completion or abandonment_] Overall, on a scale of 1-7, where 1 is very difficult and 7 is very easy, how difficult or easy was this task (accepting the request) to complete?
    1. Why did you rate this task a _#_?

**_Accepting request completion_**

1. What would you do after accepting this Veteran’s POA request?
    1. _Moderator: probe for: does the user want to bookmark the claimant in ARP? Do they immediately want to go to VBMS?_
2. Go ahead and return to your other power of attorney requests.

**_Sorting list of POA requests by location_**

1. Imagine you are tasked with approving all POA requests for your office in Wichita, Kansas. How would you find all requests in your city and then approve them? 
    1. [_If they try searching, say: Let’s say the search isn’t working for this task. Is there another way on this screen you might try to view requests by city?_]
    2. How would you select all the requests from Wichita and approve them?
    3. Success criteria: participant uses table sort by city and uses the check marks to select all requests from Wichita, KS and approves. If participant uses the zip code field, upon completion, mark partial success and direct their attention to the table sort.
2. [On task completion or abandonment] Overall, on a scale of 1-7, where 1 is very difficult and 7 is very easy, how difficult or easy was this task (sorting and then accepting multiple requests at once) to complete?
    1. Why did you rate this task a _#_?

**_Bulk select and requests table desirability_**

1. [_Warning about limitations of consent_] I want you to think back to the popup that appeared once you selected all the Wichita requests. On that popup it told you some of the 21-22s had limitations of consent. Is this what you expected to see? What do you think about this message? 
2. What do you think the upper-left checkbox does? If you select it, does it select results only on this page, or on subsequent pages?
3. If you were to search, which of the location options: city, state, and zip code, do you think you’d find most useful and why? 
    1. _Moderator: look for references to fields in the search box or alternative table views_
4. Are there other ways you’d like to be able to sort requests?

**_Viewing Veteran details and declining request_**

1. Please return to your power of attorney requests. From the table, please find and select **Gordon Diaz**, a Veteran from Valley Center, Kansas, to review their request in more detail. I will paste their information in the chat for you to reference. Without accepting or declining, what do you notice?
    1. [Moderator: Drop Veteran’s data into the chat]
    2. Success criteria: participant clicks on the name to open their details page and notices that the Veteran’s POA request does not allow access to medical records.
2. Based on the information you see here and assuming you haven’t had any direct contact with the Veteran, would you accept or decline this request? 
    1. Why?
    2. Would you contact the Veteran before acting on their request? 
3. Let’s imagine you are going to decline this request. How would you do this?

**_Decline flow desirability_**

4. What do you think about the text box [reason for declining] here?
    1. How would you expect the Veteran to find out that their POA request had been declined?
    2. Would this note be something you or your organization would use? In what way do you imagine you might use this?
1. Overall, on a scale of 1-7, where 1 is very difficult and 7 is very easy, how difficult or easy was this task [declining an individual request] to complete?
    1. Why did you rate this task a _#_?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
1. Anything else you’d like to tell us about these screens that we didn’t talk about?
2. Are there any critical features that are missing?
3. How would you describe your overall experience using this portal today? 
4. On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being “not at all likely” and 5 being “very likely, how likely would you be to recommend this tool to a VSO colleague?
    1. Would you mind telling me why you chose a _#_?

## Consent to use video clips
- I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
    - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on developing the tools that help accredited representatives assist Veterans and their beneficiaries.

I wanted to ask, if you know of anyone else at your organization who would be interested in providing feedback on new tools for representatives? It does not have to be a senior-level person or someone with extensive experience. We want to make sure we’re collecting feedback from everyone who would be benefitting from these tools. 

[Wait for response]

Our team will be sending a thank you email, where we’ll provide a link to our feedback intake form, which you can share with your colleagues.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit
[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it's easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]

* **Out of questions:** We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
* **Blame technology**: I am so sorry, but I just learned that the [website/prototype/thing I wanted to test with you today] is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.
* **Backup Moderator**: This is best to practice beforehand, but can work if there is an emergency with the moderator. Appoint another team member who will be on the call as the backup moderator. You can say “for the next part of this session [backup moderator name] will moderate.” They should be prepared to jump in if something happens to you or you are not comfortable to finish the session.
