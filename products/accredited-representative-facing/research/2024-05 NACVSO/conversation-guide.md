Hello, my name is \[NAME], I am part of the Accredited Representative Facing team at the Department of Veterans Affairs. We’re working on developing tools for VSOs to improve their work with Veterans and efficiencies with the VA. Our Accredited Representative Portal is a secure, user-friendly platform designed for VSOs like yourself to streamline Power of Attorney requests and claims processing and reduce the time to accessing a Veteran’s information in VBMS.

## Open-Ended Interview Questions

Location: Anywhere at conference

Setup: Bring a notepad or phone to take notes on the conversation

### Introduction

I have some questions about your current POA process. It should only take a few minutes of your time and would help my team understand how to support VSO representatives like yourself better. Would you be open to chatting for a few minutes? 

_\[Wait for consent]_

Is it OK if I just jot down some notes for my team while we talk? I want to make sure I don’t misremember any of your feedback. 

_\[Wait for consent]_

### Questions

_Note: Question prompts are meant to be open-ended and not prescribed. You can choose to start with any/all questions in the list, and probe deeper into any topics that come up._ 

**_Cross-accredited user mental models_**

1. What does a typical day look like supporting Veterans?
2. How many cases or Veterans are you supporting at any given time?
3. How do you fill out Form 21-22 with Veterans or non-Veteran claimants?
4. Do you ever decline to represent someone who requests POA?
   1. How do you communicate that to the Veteran?
5. How do you decide which VSOrg to put on form 21-22?
6. Do you have different workflows based on the VSOrgs you support?
   1. _Probe for specifics around which organizations have specific requirements, if they’re allowed to do the same things across orgs, etc._
7. Is everyone in your office accredited with the same VSOrgs?

**_Current state/tool usage_**

1. What tools do you use as part of your work supporting Veterans?
   1. _Probe for: case management system, third party/VA tools._
2. What do you like about your current tools? What don’t you like?
3. Do you (or does anyone in your office) currently use the Stakeholder Enterprise Portal (SEP)?
   1. Do you or have you ever used SEP to accept incoming 21-22 requests?

**_Permissions and bulk accept_**

1. Can every VSO at your organization accept or deny PoA, or can only some folks do this? 
   1. If only some can accept/deny: What rules govern who can do this? (e.g. only headquarters, only managers, only admin, etc.)
2. Is anyone in your office tasked with accepting or denying multiple POA requests at a time? (If so, we’d love to connect. Can we email you to be put in touch with them?)

**_Work location and work style_**

1. What type of office do you work in? 
   1. _Probe for: VA regional office or other VA facility like hospital, county office, no home office/rotates through different locations, online only, etc._
2. What are your biggest challenges with working in \[location(s)]?

**_ARM v2_**

1. If Veterans had a way to securely sign and submit the 21-22 digitally, how would you imagine that process going?
2. If a Veteran is in person, how would you like to fill out the 21-22 if there were a digital option, and the Veteran had to sign in to complete?
3. What % of Veterans/claimants do you anticipate would request POA online (i.e. digital submission) vs. working directly with you to complete the 21-22 form?

### Ending engagement

Thank you for talking with me today! Your feedback is really helpful to improve representative tools and improve efficiencies with supporting Veterans. My team is located at \[place in exhibit hall] with some other activities if you’re interested in providing more input on the future of representative tools. Here is my card if you’d like to stay in touch for feedback opportunities after the conference.

## Talk Back Boards

Location: At the table in the exhibit hall

Setup: At the start of each day, post a different topic to the board each day for broad rep feedback. Provide sticky notes and sharpies for participants to respond, and have stickers for people to up-vote other’s answers. This can be done unmoderated, but prompts are included for each day to engage with the participants.

| 2 | What would make the 21-22 (power of attorney) process easier? | <ul><li>How do you usually establish POA with Veterans now? What’s your role in that? How does that work in your organization?</li><li>Do you use SEP right now? Can you tell me about that experience?</li><li>Do you use QuickSubmit right now? Can you tell me about that experience?</li></ul> |
| 3 | What digital tools do you use to support Veterans? | <ul><li>How do these tools make you feel / how do you feel about these tools? _Encourage them to use “Feelings” stickers._</li><li>What’s your favorite tool?</li><li>What’s your least favorite tool?</li></ul> |

### Day 2: Search/filter

#### Introduction

Hi! We’re designing a new portal for VSOs that will allow you to accept a power of attorney request directly from a Veteran, submitted through VA.gov, and then get instant access to VBMS. Do you have a few minutes to give us your feedback on some options we’re considering for viewing and navigating those requests?

_\[Wait for consent]_

Is it OK if I just jot down some notes for my team while we talk? I want to make sure I don’t misremember any of your feedback. 

_\[Wait for consent]_

#### Prompts

_\[Show only the 3 blank search options: A2, E1, E2]_

1. Take a look at these different options for searching and filtering requests for power of attorney that a Veteran submits digitally. Tell us your impressions. Feel free to write your feedback on sticky notes (_or we write for them_). 
2. \[If they seem intrigued by one of the versions, lean into it. You can ask them how they’d run a search, then show them the populated-search version of that design.] How does this completed search look different from what you expected?
3. Let us know which design you like most and why.
4. Learning if they search for a **Vet** or a **non-Vet claimant**: Imagine you are talking with Rachel Smith, the daughter of a deceased Veteran, James Davis. Rachel wants your help filing for survivor benefits, and just filed a 21-22 online to start the process. Find the PoA request. 
   1. See if they search for James (the Vet) or Rachel (the non-Vet claimant).
5. Tell us more:
   1. Is this a tool you think you might use, and why or why not? 
   2. How would you expect to search for POA requests?
   3. How would you imagine this changing your POA process?

#### Ending engagement

### Day 3: Decline message

#### Introduction

Hi! We’re designing a new portal for VSOs that will allow you to accept or decline a power of attorney request directly from a Veteran. Do you have a few minutes to give us your feedback on some options we’re considering for declining a request?

_\[Wait for consent]_

Is it OK if I just jot down some notes for my team while we talk? I want to make sure I don’t misremember any of your feedback. 

_\[Wait for consent]_

#### Prompts

1. Imagine that you are looking at this PoA request. (Show request with limitations on health records–maybe Gordon Diaz.) Would you accept or decline?
   1. Let’s say you decline. How would you do that?
   2. (Show area where they can type a message) What would you type here?
2. Now let’s see a variation on that. (Several dropdown options and no customized place to write a message).
   1. Tell me about what you see
   2. Do you prefer to write a custom message or have these options of pre-written messages? Why?
   3. Are there cases in which these pre-filled messages wouldn’t work well?
   4. What other pre-filled messages would you need? 
3. Tell us more:
   1. Do you or your organization decline POA requests? If so, how do you communicate with the Veteran about the reasons why?
   2. Would either of these options reduce the amount of work you or others in your office need to do?

### Introduction

My team is developing a tool to streamline Power of Attorney requests and claims processing and reduce the time to accessing a Veteran’s information in VBMS. I have a mobile and tablet-ready mockup of a tool that my team is working on and I would love some feedback. It would only take a minute or two of your time. The mockup is just a hypothetical design and is not connected to any VA systems, your accreditation number, or live Veteran data. Would you be interested in taking a look? 

_\[Wait for consent]_

Are you able to scan a QR code or would you like to look at the design on my phone screen? 

_\[Wait for option]_

### Prompts

1. Do you (or does anyone in your office) ever use a mobile phone or tablet to fill out forms with Veterans?
   1. Is there any reason you can think of that having a phone or tablet-ready tool to support your work with Veterans would be used by your organization?

_\[Present them with a QR code (either printed or from the_ [_QR section_](#mobile-prototype-qr-codes-for-scanning) _below) or pull up Figma mocks on your phone and hand it to the user.]_

2. This is just a mockup so not everything is interactive, but you should be able to tap things on the screen just like you would with any app downloaded on a phone. Imagine that your computer is being fixed and you are working with paper and your cellphone while you wait for a replacement computer. You have a call with a **Veteran named Bob Jones who lives in New York**, who says he just filed a 21-22 form on VA.gov. Find Bob Jones’ request in the portal.

_Success criteria: Find all the Bob Joneses in New York City. There are many. Participant will ask how to know which one is the correct person. Ask them what criteria THEY would want to use to find the right person among this list. In this scenario, they can ask him for additional info via the phone, although asking birthday and SSN won’t help because those aren’t on the table and they can’t filter by them._ 

3. On a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 was very difficult and 7 was very easy, how difficult or easy was it to find Bob Jones from New York’s request?

For E1/E2:

4. Do you have any other feedback about the tool you just used?
5. There are some other features in this tool I can show you if you have another moment. 
6. I want to draw your attention to the “results per page.” Where on the screen would you prefer that to be?

For all:

7. There are some other features in this tool I can show you if you have another moment. 

_\[Wait for consent - if no, end the engagement]_

8. Please click the third Bob Jones from the list of POA requests. Go ahead and take a look at the request and let me know what you think. 
9. Does the information on this screen provide enough information to decide whether you’re going to accept or decline Bob Jones’ POA request? 
   1. Why/why not?
10. I can show you some other design concepts we’re considering for this tool if you have time. Do you have a little longer to chat?

_\[Wait for consent - if yes, note which mock you show the participant 2nd/3rd in your notes. If answer is no, end the engagement]_

### Ending engagement

Thank you for talking with me today! Your feedback is really helpful to improve representative tools and improve efficiencies with supporting Veterans. If you come back another day we’ll have other activities to provide feedback. Here is my card if you’d like to stay in touch for feedback opportunities after the conference.

## Claims Clinic Observation

Location: At the claims clinic

Setup: Bring notebook or phone for note taking.

_Instructions for claims clinic observers_:
- Obtain verbal consent from the VSO representative and their Veteran/non-Veteran claimant before beginning to record.
- Assume the role of a “trainee” rather than a researcher
- **Do not** capture any notes that record PII/PHI

### Start of observation

The researcher should record the following:
- Date/time
- The home VSOrg of the rep being shadowed
- Their claims clinic gear (E.g. Do they have a computer? PIV card and reader? Mobile phone or tablet? Paper forms?)

### Claimant initiation

The researcher should record the following:
- How does the representative introduce themselves to the Veteran/claimant? What title/org information do they provide?
- What is their “pitch” - how do they describe representation to the Veteran/claimant?

### POA/Claims process

The researcher should record the following:
- How does the representative explain the 21-22? 
- How is the 21-22 filled out with the Veteran/claimant?
- How are limitations of consent explained to the Veteran/claimant?
- Does the Veteran/claimant, or the representative, pick the specific VSOrg listed on the 21-22?
- What other forms are filed or started at this time?
- How are the forms submitted, if at all?
- Are arrangements made for a follow-up appointment?

### Ending engagement

Thank the Veteran/claimant and the representative for allowing you to shadow them. 

#### Post-engagement

Open [Google Forms](https://forms.gle/FzKUdnWKtt65wbkq7), add notes and submit.

## Find a Representative Feedback

Location: At table

Design asset: [Find a Representative](https://www.va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/find-rep/), Laptop, notepad or personal mobile device for notes (optional)

_Note: priority should be given to collecting feedback for ARP and gaps in cross-accredited user mental models. If an opportunity arises where a representative wants to continue giving feedback or has referenced Veterans finding their information online, shift to FAR intercept._

### Introduction

There’s a new tool on VA.gov that helps Veterans and non-Veteran claimants locate VSO representatives near them. Would you like to take a look at the tool and provide some feedback?

_\[Wait for consent]_

Is it OK if I just jot down some notes for my team while we talk? I want to make sure I don’t misremember any of your feedback. 

_\[Wait for consent]_

### Questions

1. Feel free to read down the page; does anything stand out to you?
2. What would you change about the page?
3. Try searching for yourself with the tool.
   1. _Probe for: using VSOrg instead of name in search field, note if they are unable to locate themselves in notes_.
4. Try opening that “See associated organizations” dropdown below your name. Are you accredited with all of these organizations?
   1. Which order would you prefer to see these in? (_Probe for: “home” organization_)
5. Is your contact information accurate?
   1. (_If inaccurate_) How would you like to update your contact information so Veterans can find you?
   2. (_If accurate_) If your contact information was to ever change, how would you go about getting that updated so Veterans are able to easily find you?
6. How do you/your org decide which address and contact information to use? 
   1. _Probe for:_ Do VSO Reps with multiple accreditations have the concept of a “main” VSO office? I wonder if we could use the address on file to deduce which VSO is their “main” VSO.
7. Go ahead and click the “Report outdated information button.” Would you feel comfortable using this to update your information?
   1. If not, why not?
   2. What language would we use for the button or popup so you’d feel comfortable updating your information?
8. If you needed to update your information with OGC, how would you do it today?
   1. Do you ever check your information on OGC?

### Ending engagement

Thank you for talking with me today! Your feedback is really helpful to improve the Veteran-facing experience to find representatives like yourself. If you come back another day we’ll have other activities to provide feedback. Here is my card if you’d like to stay in touch for feedback opportunities after the conference.
