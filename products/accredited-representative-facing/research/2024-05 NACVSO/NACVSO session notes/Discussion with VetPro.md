Some notes from chatting with Jeff, the CEO of VetPro:
* He met with Charles Worthington a few years back and is interested in licensing or even selling VetPro to VA. He would love to partner with VA more.
* They are working on POA auto-establishment and will be piloting with some CVSOs soon, but they are waiting on permissions from Lighthouse and/or others at VA.
* VetPro costs $550 per user per year. It's comparable to the cost of Tyler Tech. VetPro is only 30-40 employees and is focused entirely on VSOs, whereas Tyler Tech is huge and doesn't have that same focus. Tyler Tech bought out 3 other companies that were previous competitors.

And notes from chatting with Marion, one of their tech specialists, and getting a quick demo:
* Changes to forms is a huge pain point.
* VA has been "talking about getting rid of SEP for 10 years."
* The landing page includes a welcome/profile fox, a "recent activity" box, and a "reminders" box.
* They do a family-tree style visual for a Veteran's dependents / spouse / etc.
* They use a fuzzy search that lets the user search by name, phone, social, or file number. They find that name is the most commonly used.
* Clients beyond CVSOs include some American Legions and VFW.
