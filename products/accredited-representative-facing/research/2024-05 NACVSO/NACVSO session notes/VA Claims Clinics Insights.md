# **VA Claims Clinics Insights**

_Notes from Gabriel Zurita._

During the NACVSO conference, VSOrgs held a claim clinic to assist Veterans in establishing power of attorney and processing claims. At the conclusion of the conference, they provided this information about how the claims clinic went. 

## Recording
A [video recording can be accessed here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/FnaContPL3YXSXT28).
* The first 15 minutes: Claims Clinic insights
* 16: conference video
* 17: president closing remarks

## Purpose of Clinic
* To train, mentor, and network with NACVSO members

## Who was involved?
* NACVSO CVSOs & NACVSO Exhibitors
* VA (MDEO, Denver VARO, VEO, VHA, Home Loans, VRE, NCA)
* Colorado County VSOffs

## What has happened?
* Preparation - Spring registrations. What we knew, what we thought might happen.
* Typically, VA advertises with a flyer and no QR codes.
    * NACVSO created a QR code and documentation to prepare VSOs
    * Troubleshooting and all.
    * QR Code registered 46. CO still has access to that list. NACVSO didn’t want to create a lot of chaos with POAs, so it kept VSO participants limited to CO. It was also desired not to make a POA mess with people having to switch after the conference.
* One CO VSO per table. Feathered in one experienced VSOff with one less experienced VSOff.
* VA created a registration link, and NACVSO created a registration link. The goal is to capture those that are outside of VBA systems.

## How is it going (status report)?
* 1398 appointments were scheduled before NACVSO got to Denver.
* 150 exams are scheduled for Monday next week.
* 500 or more check-ins from the upstairs table.
* Once they came down the escalator, there were greeters there ready.
* Had rooms inside the hotel for mental health or items sensitive in nature.
* They got some spikes, so I created overflow space. Rented all the parking spaces.
* VSO room, VBA room, DHA, Homeloan, and Cemetery rooms.
* One of the biggest learnings was how to work together
* VA wanted to do increases and secondaries. Schedule exams more easily if they are already established. Take any weight off of them that wasn’t already on them.
    * More than numbers, I wanted good conversations to have quality over quantity.
* They tried to do 4-hour shifts, but not everyone showed up.
* Be flexible; do no harm. If you see an opportunity to engage, take it on.
* Several homeless vets. Terminal cases of people coming in who probably shouldn’t have left the house.

### **Outcomes**
VSO numbers — Ideally, this should have been done at Citrix. They ended up doing it with pen and paper:

* POA: 30
    * Mostly Colorado
* ITF: 11
* COMP: 87
* DEP: 4
* VRE: 1
* Attendance: 723 in
* Exams Completed: 379

### Where do we go from here?
* VA: Smoothest run claims clinic they’ve ever seen
* Might keep doing it again
