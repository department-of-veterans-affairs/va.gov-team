# Updates from VBA

[Joshua Jacobs](https://department.va.gov/staff-biographies/joshua-jacobs/) serves as the Under Secretary for Benefits. He has served there since [2023](https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-welcomes-joshua-jacobs-as-under-secretary-for-benefits/). Notes from his update:
* VBA - focus on claims quality, doing a day dedicated to it
* Exams process - C&P exams deep dive; private DBQs, scheduling request tool, automated exam ordering
* Modernizing training methods - enhancing employee efficiency and effectiveness. Timely and quality decisions. Multi-phased approach to improve training.
* Equity- they have a new office of equity assurance. They want to make sure Veterans get benefits they deserve no matter who they love or where they lie. She’s presenting later. Did research: when you get a Veteran to file a claim within the first year and they work with an accredited representative, disparities are significantly reduced or eliminated.
    * Outreach to  Veterans to use accredited reps, don’t fall victims to scammers like claims sharks looking to take advantage of Veterans
*  MST claims are taking too long. These claims are difficult. Evidentiary records not easily received or available. Want Veterans to get claims reviewed quickly and accurately. MST office has 363 full-time employees. To reduce time, are increasing by 143 additional claims processors. Brought in a “surge team” with 238 processors to help and drive down wait time.
* Looking at error trends to address and apply lessons learned. 
* 40k Veterans at risk of going into foreclosure. We can help Veterans get a home, stay in homes, and modify home when necessary. Launched a new program - a loss mitigation option to support those Veterans at risk of foreclosure who don’t qualify. Could be loan modification. Starts May 31 and allows VA to purchase those loans, waterfall retention process. Refinance at 2.5%, extend to 30 or 40 years. Goal to do everything in their power to keep Veterans in their homes. 

Q&A:
* Upload CHAMPVA to QuickSubmit or through an online program?
    * A: will take to VHA that administers that program, work to get an answer.
* VHA providers - can we move to ready decision? 
    * A: VHA providers are supposed to treat DBQs, it’s ambiguous, leaves them feeling exposed. Worked with the undersecretary for health to revise that directive and provide more clarity about what VA doctors can and can’t do. Want to thread needle: greater access and efficiency (don’t send to exam if don’t need to), and don’t want to get in way of provider and patient. Will come back and provide info.
* Processing time of dependent claims can be 6 months. What are you doing?
    * A: Increasing staffing at pension management centers. We know it’s a pain point. Looking at dependents and survivors and we have work to do. A lot of it has to do with increasing staffing. Holding leadership accountable for improving those time. 
* Development letters with numerous errors. Are you using AI technology to issue development letters?
    * A: Not that I’m aware of, but if you can share examples that would help. We’ve hired a lot, growing 25%, and we’re seeing error trends in development space. We have broader issues with letters, we’re working to re-write them. Would like to see specific examples.
* Hiring staff, what is the processing timeframe? What is the goal?
    * Goal is to bring on new people within 80 days. Challenge with MST claims is requires employees who is much more experience, and can do this work day in and day out. It’s incredibly emotionally draining work. You all know this. You’re dealing with survivors and the stories they share, it’s hard to deal with and takes a special type of person to dedicate themselves full-time to this work. Our team in Roanoke we’ve been working to get trained. Will take at least 6 months to get the MST center fully staffed. That’s why we put in surge capability. MST claims on average have 11-15 individual contentions, not all MST related. Exploring if we can split the claim to have office focus solely on MST. We need technology to do that, and need to make sure there aren’t unintended consequences. And want to be effective and efficient and right timeliness and quality.
* Any estimated timeline for when 2023 [GDS] report will be released? 
    * Mindful they drive budgetary decisions, will go back and ask for timeline. Haven’t heard recently. Last year was published in July. It’s a ton of information. 
* Open access, talked about legalities, conversation with OGC, what info could be open to us that may not have POA? Help us know their income, if they’re enrolled in VHA, that wouldn’t violate any kind of privacy act. Is that a conversation we could further so we could service Veterans who we don’t have a POA on? Homeless Veterans.
    * A: Absolutely. Feel like groundhogs day, I’d like to put this thing to bed. The claims clinic is a good example, we’re working shoulder to shoulder helping Veterans. Let’s figure out how to work more efficiency and share information. With all respect to lawyers, challenge is they are very conservative. Want to keep us out of trouble. Will be talking at OGC Leadership in coming week(s) and want to find out how we can overcome those barriers.  
* If a claim is deferred, why don’t you count days pending?
    * A: Will get back to you, wasn’t aware of this
* Anything within VBMS to get a claim out of NWQ when a priority claim submitee to get human eyes on a claim?
    * A: If something held up, reach out to regional office leadership. If misidentified a claim and warrants moving. Benefit of NWQ is processing and delivering claims more efficiently. But if things aren’t working, reach out to RO leadership. Can performa red team review of NWQ. Was designed to optimize new e-processing, which was right, but there need to be tweaks. Ask tough questions. Specific questions can be raised. Ken Smith oversees NWQ. 
* Home loan reduction available for surviving spouses?
    * A: Can be eligible, depends on circumstance. So answer is yes, possibly.
* VBMS feature to generate summary of benefits letters?
    * A: Not sure, We are looking at future of VBMS. 5-year IT modernization plan, section 701 of PACT ACT and lays out plan ot modernize VBMS. Improving SEP. A lot of IT projects. I don’t know the answer to this specific ones, but list of IT development needs much larger than the budget to execute on those needs. Have to ruthlessly prioritize. Dollars are going to maintenance and development of new systems intended to help front and back end processes.
* Higher level reviews sitting for months at a time without updates? (CLAPPING)
    * A: I thought we were doing well, I’ll look at the data. Asked some ROs to take on that work. Haven’t looked in awhile, so a reminder I need to personally do that. We had an offsite a couple months ago considering [AMA] and looking at systems issues. Ultimate challenge is we’re a victim of our own success. 40% increase in claims since last year. Worked to hire and get more staff, but not at the same pace. Brought in ROs to help with that work but will find out what’s going on there.
* Higher-level review process, online method to schedule why do we still need to phone call to schedule time and date?
    * A: I thought we addressed. People are still being forced to call? (YES). Interesting. Sorry you’re dealing with that. 
* DIC could be worked at RO to prevent wait times?
    * A: Challenge is we’ve increased staffing levels, but complexity of the work. Inconsistencies if we take that workload and distribute it, will the quality decrease. We’re exploring and haven’t settled on an answer yet.
