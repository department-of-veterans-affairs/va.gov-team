# Legislative updates

Below are several pieces of legislation discussed at NACVSO.

**[The CVSO Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/106):** “Commitment to Veteran Support and Outreach Act”
* Purpose is to authorize money to increase state and county budgets when there is legislation that impacts the workload. Often when legislation passes, the workload goes up but there is no funding or infrastructure support. We’re happy the legislation passed, like the PACT ACT, but then we deal with more unmet needs and workload.

**[Gerald’s Law](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/234#:~:text=This%20bill%20requires%20the%20Department,hospital%20or%20nursing%20home%20care)**
* Burial and funeral allowance
* NACVSO, along with VFW, DAV, and accredited attorneys, and others are in public opposition to a new law. This is rare for them to publicly oppose legislation. The law would privatize representation for disability benefits, allowing for-profit companies to become accredited. It is being pushed as being a way to expand options, but it goes against Veterans’ interests. Veterans need access to care without having to leverage their future benefit. Pro bono work would disappear if this is passed. They are strongly against this because their interest is in Veterans, not in money.
