# Updates on EHRM

VA’s electronic health records are undergoing a massive update. The contract was awarded to Oracle Health. It hasn’t gone entirely smoothly. 

This is an update on the Electronic Health Record Modernization ([EHRM](https://digital.va.gov/ehr-modernization/)) process from [Matthew Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-miller-48b51a17), Director, Veteran and Military Family Engagement. 

* Rightful skepticism, challenges of processes.
* 1000s of programmers working to fix deficiencies and improve to the standard Veterans deserve,
* Proof of this concept can be seen in EHRM deployment in all military facilities. 
* Imagine: centralized digital platform that contains all medical history, medication and treatment plans, etc. Better healthcare outcomes. 
* Once deployed, will be a massive tool in your toolbox.
