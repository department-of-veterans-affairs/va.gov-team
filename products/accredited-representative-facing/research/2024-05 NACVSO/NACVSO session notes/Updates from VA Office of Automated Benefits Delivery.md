# Updates from VA Office of Automated Benefits Delivery   

Presented by:
* [Paul Shute](https://department.va.gov/staff-biographies/paul-shute/), Asst. Deputy Undersecretary   
* Angela Moritz, Asst. Director of Business Strategy 

Notes: 
* Leveraging tech for Veterans to manage their benefits as well as support for claims processors in processing claims
* Automated benefits delivery updates
    * Building automation as a technology to augment, not replace, the work our employees do. Something inherently human in disability decisions we make for Veterans - tech can’t replace that. But there are tasks we can automate to deliver fast, accurate, consistent decisions. Examples: 
        * Gathering records
        * Verifying military service
    * Mail intake example:
        * Took 30 days on average from claim received to placed under end product control. Now, 70% of mail received by VBA is placed under end product control or associate with a Veteran’s eFolder within 24 hours of receipt. Average time is 2.5 hours for processing. Intake and triage and associate with a Veteran’s record.
    * **From:** claims processors had to log into CAPRI, identify treatment encounters from each medical facility, build a report, and upload the report to the Veteran’s eFolder. 
        * **To:** all claims that utilize ADS have VHA medical records automatically uploaded to the Veteran’s VBMS eFolder a the time of claims establishment. 
    * **From:** claims processor manually reviewed each document in a Veteran’s eFolder to determine what information was included. 
        * **To:** Claims processors can search for and uncover specific content across all records within the Veteran’s eFolder in a matter of seconds. 
    * **From:** RVSRs manually transcribed exam results from DBQ into VBMS rating calendars. 
        * **To:** DBQ data for 27 DBQs is automatically ingested into the VBMS rating calculators, reducing manual data entry for RVSRs. Reduces errors.
        * This tech is about: speed, accuracy, consistency, and standardization. 
        * Harnessing medical data in new ways. Our challenge is how to harness all this data - now more than ever - to benefit Veterans.
    * **From:** Claims processors read through a Veteran’s entire eFolder to determine what evidence was included and could apple to the pending claim. 
        * **To:** Veteran’s VBMS eFolders are intelligently indexed and hyperlinked to reference documents that help claims processors identify relevant evidence for a specific claim. 
* Claims status tool (va.gov)
    * Hear from Veterans they want to know status of claim, want it described more clearly. They’re overhauling that product to provide more consistent communication on claims status.
    * Challenges that tech can help us address:
        * Change is accelerating at a rapid pace and employees need our help to address it (e.g., PACT Act). 
        * Higher complexity claims and increasing production demands. Number of issues a Veteran claims is larger. 
        * Connection is critical to developing better solutions, building buy-in, and staying centered on the mission. Want to take away administrative tasks to allow VSOs to focus on supporting the Veteran. 
    * Veterans get a link to “Manage claims and appeals” when they sign in from the home page.
    * Improvements:
        * Claims appeals listing - claims cards v2. Released Dec 2023: made it easier to recognize when the Veteran needs to take action and which claims are in progress. Made available decision letters more noticeable by reducing the number of icons. Made date submitted more prominent because Veterans rely on it to find a specific claim. 
    * Current pain points:
        * Veterans are frustrated with how long their claims appear to be stuck in a single step.
        * Veterans find the combined “evidence gathering, review, and decision” step to be a “black box” of little value. 
        * Both of these ^ Will be addressed in v3, targeted for June.
        * “Ready for decision” is not language used, but “Preparation for notification.”
    * May 2024 release:
        * Used the status tab to focus on what the Veteran needs to do and what VA is doing
        * Increased visibility of recent activity in the status tab. Ex. “records received.” 
        * Moved the process description from the Status tab to an Overview tab that includes all the steps. 
    * Veteran response was very positive in usability testing of claim details v2.
        * Liked the “recent activity” section
        * Responded well to the CST Status tab framing of “What you need to do” and “What we’re doing”
        * Responded well to the line, “This is the longest step in the process.” Transparent, self-aware language like this seems to set better expectations and put Veterans at ease.
        * Liked the blurb associated with evidence requests that explains what the request is and how to fulfill it
    * Improvements schedule for June 2024:
        * Break up grouped statuses
        * Set expectations that some steps repeat
        * Explain what typically happens in each step and the role of the person working on their claim
* Communications improvements
    * Strategic communication plan necessary. Overhauling a lot of internal and external communications. What tech is being delivered when and how impacts you and your constituents. 
    * **From:** Aged intranet pages that made it challenging to find useful info that was updated in a timely manner. 
        * **To:** Modernized Sharepoint backbone for near real-time content updates and easy-to-find information. 
    * **From:** Release notes distributed via email with PDF attachments. 
        * **To:** Electronic distribution via Sharepoint backbone for near real-time content updates and easy-to-find information indexed by condition with usage and feedback statistics. 
    * **From:** Automation Feedback Tracker captured via Excel files requiring manual calculations and triage. 
        * **To:** Feedback captured via PowerApp with real-time data collection and summaries reducing duplicate entries and manual tasks. 
* Our belief is that tech can make work better and more efficient for our employees to increase access and improve outcomes for Veterans, families, and survivors. 
* Pain point re: access to VBMS when you don’t have POA establish. Paul and Marty are going to sit down with attorneys to see if there’s a solution. It’s not a technological constraint. 
* Are our letters generated using AI? Today, all letters not generated by humans are generated using a rules-based process; it’s a decision tree in code. There was an error in the code that led to mistake in forms recommended. Mike identified this and reached out to Marty and within 24 hours they were able to deliver a fix. Thanks, Mike! Leverage Marty, Chris, and Kim to resolve issues. 
* Informal conferences - it’s not a modern process. Frustration with the system. We’re going to be piloting a self-service tool, integrated data solution to self-schedule. Pilot in October of this year. 
* Q&A:
    * NC - Marty is one of us and we appreciate what he does. But we have a lot of rural counties that don’t have the technology. What are you doing to do for those counties that don’t have this technology? 
        * A: Many of use may use SEP in the past. We are building the ability for VSOs to leverage those same products so you have the same level of visibility as the Veterans you’re helping. Great third party products, but giving you another option. If Veterans using va.gov, you should be able to see what's in their profile, claims status tool. Building that common infrastructure so both Veterans and their reps can access that information. Visit the booth! Leverage them. When we reach out, throw your hat in the ring. 
    * Q: Claims sharks are encouraging Vets to get information from claims status tool. Can we…
        * A: We are trying to direct people to accredited reps. Nobody does this work better than you all. Redirect to people who provide world class service like yourselves.
    * Q: Internal requests on va.gov not show up on va.gov? 
        * A: That should not be happening. We’re aware it has happened in the past. When you see something, say something. It should be clear in claims status tool when it’s an action the Veteran needs to take vs. the VA. You should see improvements with upcoming releases.
    * Q: How is VA simplifying its communications with Veterans about their claims on va.gov?
        * A: Have to enable Veterans to navigate to information relevant to them. Creating that single front door. Used to be across multiple websites. 7 years ago website was structured the way we organize internally; now we’re looking at how Veteran’s navigate. 80% of reasons Veterans come to va.gov now on the homepage. And we want Veterans to log in. We can then expose data: we know their claim history, military service, etc. Don’t need to ask Veterans questions we already know the answer to. Authenticated tools let us use data integration and create more personalized experiences. Also making mobile enabled. 
    * Q: As VSO, how to help claim move through process?
        * A: Automated decision support homepage. Lots of job aids, other videos. And automation eligible conditions. 26 PACT ACT conditions. So leveraging that functionality. And release notes - understanding how technology functions today. User guides, etc. will help you. And what can the system do. Reduce administrative burden for Veterans by tapping into data. 
    * Q: To address direct deposit issues, can the phrase “void check” be added to smart vocab? [Applause]
        * A: Don’t see why that can’t happen. We’re instituting a lot of AI and machine learning products, data extraction etc. Seems doable, let’s connect on that.
