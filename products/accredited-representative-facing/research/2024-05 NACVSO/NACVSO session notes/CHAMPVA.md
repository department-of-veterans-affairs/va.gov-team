# CHAMPVA

Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs ([CHAMPVA](https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/health-and-disability/champva/)) is a program that covers the cost of some of spouse and dependant health care services and supplies. Below are notes from their update: 
* [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) form modernization
* Mailroom scanning: 90-day backlog (shows 45 days in some online systems, but it’s 90)
    * It used to be six months, so it’s improving (this got claps).
    * CHAMPVA wants to bring it down to 30 days.
* There have been some complaints from VSOfs about lost forms (disappearing). Response: Fax and mail leave many opportunities for forms to be lost. The online portal will improve this. CHAMPVA migrated to a new VA fax system, but it had difficulties. Applications come in as faxes, get printed, and then scanned into the CHAMPVA system to be analyzed by benefits people, which is error-prone. They are working to integrate fax into their system to decrease this risk.
* CHAMPVA only has half of the eligibility staff (50% capacity). Pressure needs to be applied up above. They want to help improve the situation and reduce the backlog but must be staffed. They asked VSOffs to reach out to their congresspeople.
* Does CHAMPVA get access to VA systems?
    * Share: CHAMPVA uses the VBA database to verify family and service-connected death dates. It's better to submit records for staff so CHAMPVA can do fewer send-backs.
* 400K applications in 4 months result in a lot of denials. For whatever reason, they are not eligible. There needs to be more capacity to call every individual who is denied and adequate resources to make that level of outbound calls. This is a pain point for VSOffs.
