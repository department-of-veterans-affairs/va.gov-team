## Research Goals

The Accredited Representative Facing Team is seeking to re-envision the accredited representative experience so that representatives can more seamlessly and accurately help Veterans with their VA interactions, including helping Veterans apply for, manage, and update their VA benefits.

Our initial focus is on the process of accepting Power of Attorney (POA) given in Form 21-22, in which a Veterans Service Officer (VSOff) accepts representation requests from a Veteran on behalf of a Veterans Service Organization (VSOrg), granting the VSOrg POA.


### OCTO Priorities

**Grow digital submissions** / Focus on the needs of accredited representatives, and the Veterans who work with them: After years of focusing exclusively on Veterans who want to interact directly with VA, we will build tools for Veterans who want to work with accredited representatives, and the reps who support those Veterans. In doing so, we will redirect to VA.gov traffic currently going through eBenefits and Stakeholder Enterprise Portal (SEP).

Full list of [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md).


### Veteran Journey

Any/all points when a Veteran needs support filing and accessing their benefits.


### Goals

- Understand accredited representatives’ most pressing unmet needs, current pain points, and desires for a new tool that supports their work with Veterans.


### Outcomes

- Identify user tasks flows, prioritize features, and gain insight into initial navigation for the ARP  MVP.

- Determine how to design an experience that is visually distinct from VA.gov, for accredited representatives who are Veterans.


## Research Questions

1. How is SEP (Stakeholder Enterprise Portal), or third party case management tools, used to support the complete Veteran claims process?

   - How are VBMS (Core, -R and -A) and other systems used in conjunction with SEP, or like tools, and what cross-functionality is necessary for the new rep-facing tool?

2. What task flows are essential to accepting or declining a POA request from a Veteran or claimant?

3. What information and calls to action do accredited representatives expect to find on the dashboard of a tool for supporting Veterans claims?

4. What notifications, if any, do accredited representatives need to manage the approval and rejection of POA requests?

5. How do Veterans Service Organizations (VSOrgs) handle permissioning between different levels within the organization, and how would a tool to support organization-wide POA provide differing levels of access?


## Methodology

**Semi-structured interviews** / Open-ended questions to gather insight into representatives’ experiences and knowledge. Questions vary depending on the participant.

**Participatory design** / The moderator shows the representative current low fidelity prototypes for the Accredited Representative Portal in Mural. The representative is prompted for design feedback around primary/tertiary navigation, essential tasks, and features.


### Participatory design prompts

1. Let’s imagine you sit down at your computer to do your work as an accredited representative, and you’re accessing the system with all the tasks you need to complete your job. Where do you ideally go on your computer to access that system?

2. What information do you need to see on the landing page before you log in?

3. This tool is meant to be for accredited representatives, and not a Veteran-facing tool. What would make it clear to you that this system is for professional use managing representation and not for managing your own benefits and claims?

4. What information do you expect to find on the dashboard?

5. What would you consider your top three tasks you need to accomplish in this system?

6. In a scenario where you are logged into the tool to look at incoming power of attorney requests, what information would you want to be able to see about claimants to help you decide whether or not to accept that request on behalf of your organization?

7. What statistics or “quick hits” of information would you like to see if you’re quickly checking this system?

8. What critical information or updates would you want to be alerted of?


## Key Findings

- VSOfficers’ power of attorney workflows require toggling between many tools.

- The current power of attorney process is conversational and is hardly ever done as a singular task.

- VSOfficers need a certain amount of information about the Veteran before deciding to accept or decline an incoming power of attorney request.

- After filing a 21-22, VSOfficers spend a lot of time manually tracking their access to a claimant’s e-Folder and the status of their claims.


## Details of Findings

### Key Finding 1 

**VSOfficers’ power of attorney workflows require toggling between many tools.** 

- While a recent audit of representative tools recorded over 24 applications representatives use to support Veterans, most participants we spoke to spent the majority of their workday in VBMS, a case management system (CMS), and a claims upload or submission tool.

  - Participants who reported they work with Veterans on a daily/weekly basis said that more than half of their time is spent in VBMS

  - While representatives said that the COVID-19 pandemic increased the use of virtual and asynchronous tools, the majority still provide services to Veterans in-person and synchronously

### List of tools mentioned in interviews related to power of attorney:

|       **Tool**              |          **Purpose in POA task flow** |    **Frequency**           |
| :---------------------------------- | :-------------------|    :------------------- |   
| SEP                                | Managing incoming requests for power of attorney.                                                                                                                          | 9             |
| VBMS                               | Looking at prior claims, check the status of a claim, review a claimant’s e-Folder, as well as notes from VSRs. Used once POA has been established.                        | 9             |
| 3rd Party Case Management software | Tracking claimants and their open cases. Most commonly cited tools were VetraSpec and TVB by Tyler Tech.\*                                                                 | 6             |
| QuickSubmit/Direct Upload          | Submitting data into the VA’s Central Mail portal. Speed of access currently varies.                                                                                       | 3             |

- Digital tools available today do not satisfy the needs of VSOfficers when trying to prepare and obtain power of attorney, requiring the majority to file 21-22s through Central Mail.

  - 6 of 9 participants use third party claims management software to support the filing of claims, but speed of access to claimants’ e-Folder has gone down, with increased time being spent filing using other tools such as QuickSubmit.

  - 9 of 9 participants said that their organizations either currently or previously used SEP as part of their power of attorney workflow. Deprecation of the tool, bugs with accepting requests and lack of updated forms in the system have made it a less viable one-stop tool for representation management.

- _Quotes_

  - _“We used to have this great program called D2D and it was a great program. Unfortunately our current contractor is having difficulties initiating that. What that would do for us is I could do a 21-22 power of attorney document and submit it directly, and it would show up immediately in VBMS. The problem now is we don’t have that level of exchange with VBMS. \[...] So there’s a delay, right, and that delay can be a day, or in some cases, \[VBMS] doesn’t populate the documents and it could be weeks before they show up. ” -P1_

  - _“We don’t use \[SEP] near as much anymore. It’s not as user friendly when we can just use VetraSpect and direct submit through that. We create the forms in there and direct submit them to the VA that way.” -P2_

  - _“\[County] VSOs use some kind of claims management software, we all use something different. Some of that interfaces with the VA, some of it doesn’t. The systems I use, and most of the largest players out there, all have the API established where claims get filed directly into the VA. Once that’s filed, the problem is the systems don’t talk back.” -P9_

* VSOfficers like to do as much as they can when meeting with a Veteran, but technical limitations can get in the way, such as:

  - VSOfficers are unable to automatically update their CMS with actions taken within VA tools.

  - Representatives are not notified when action is taken on a power of attorney request or a claim without checking multiple tools.

* _Quotes_

  - _“\[Deers is…] for logging your dependents and your information. The \[SEP] system was tied in with that. So if there was misinformation like, for example, it was missing date of birth or gender, you couldn’t \[submit through SEP]. It wouldn’t allow you to set up the account and approve anything, because it would say they can’t verify the person.” -P3_

- Most representatives we spoke to do field visits and claims clinics away from the office on a regular basis, which are not well-supported by existing accredited representative tools. 

  - Participants noted that site visits to long-term care facilities, rural communities and prisons to support Veterans cannot rely on VA network tools because of Veteran or environmental limitations.

  - While VSOfficers may be completing the 21-22, they do not have time or speed of access to the Veteran’s e-Folder, making it impossible to determine the next steps on the Veteran’s case. In these situations, Veterans may be waiting until the next time the VSOrg does a claims clinic in their area, sometimes months later, to make contact again.

- _Quotes_

  - _“We have our laptops and we have QuickSubmit, but that still takes \[24-48 hours] for the system to \[give us access]. If there was a system where you could upload and immediately get access, it would be more helpful when we’re on those outreaches. We just did one in November, we probably saw close to 100 Veterans between 5 counties, and some of them we probably could have helped a little bit faster right then and there. Or at least been able to access their files and answer their simple questions a lot faster.” -P6_

  - _“A lot of offices have gone to \[electronic signatures] but if we’re in a nursing home, we don’t take a tablet out there and have them sign it. We just take the paper \[form] out there and sign it.” -P9_

  - _“We have some reps go into prisons and stuff like that…so they’re still doing things by paper. For me and most people that we work with, we try to make everything electronic.” -P9_


### Key Finding 2

**The current power of attorney process is conversational and is hardly ever done as a singular task.**

- While completing the 21-22 form takes a matter of minutes, most VSOfficers have a much larger intake process around the form that determines additional workflows and supports for the Veteran.

- Participants’ 21-22 workflow varied based on the type of VSOrganization they represented.

  - In addition to national and local locations with VSOfficers, large VSOrgs have unaccredited volunteers who help Veterans complete the 21-22. The volunteers then submit the form to the national office for approval and filing.

  - State, county and regional VSOrgs will confirm with Veterans if they have membership with or existing representation from a specific VSOrg. If they do not, they will make a selection for them.

    1. If a Veteran has a representative on file - VSOfficers will do their best to find someone in their office or a nearby VSOrg location to send the Veteran.

    2. If a Veteran does not have existing representation - The only criteria VSOfficers who hold multiple accreditations use when determining which organization to put on the 21-22 is whether other VSOfficers in their office or region will be able to support the claimant if they are unavailable.

* Establishing power of attorney is seen as a prerequisite for work that VSOfficers do with Veterans. It is often a follow-on task that’s part of a larger interview and level-setting conversation with the claimant, rather than a transactional process that happens before engagement. 

  - Representatives use the 21-22 and interview process to provide level-setting around what representation involves, and the amount of support the claimant can expect to receive

  - State and County representatives said that the interview is necessary to triage a claimant’s urgent needs and to determine eligibility for VA and non-VA wraparound support 

* _Quotes_

  - _“American Legion, they are pretty much strictly doing VA-to-Veteran kind of stuff, whereas our offices being a county office, a government \[...] we run other programs based on state benefits and county benefits that are available. We’ve heard from other folks how important those other interventions and supports are for the Veteran.” - P9_

  - _“If you have someone come in that is on a hardship, or has a very tight deadline, we won’t submit. I won’t submit a claim unless I know what’s going on, because it can jeopardize their benefits. But for us to get access to the claims file, we have to submit \[the 21-22], and then it’s going to take 2 weeks to get access. Sometimes the VA public contact teams who are the ones working the VA front desk \[...] will update representation for us, but even with that it still takes a few hours for the system to cycle.” -P3_

  - _“Maybe there’s a homeless Veteran that we’re trying to verify is in the \[VA] healthcare system. Did you get an honorable discharge? Are they eligible for SSD, homeless money and stuff like that. A lot of times the VA is coming to us because we’re on the ground in the community and have that access back to the VA that they can’t even get.” -P9_

  - _“In my particular office, we offer programs that encompass real estate tax exemption programs or emergency assistance programs. We do kind of a cradle to grave with compensation claims as well as pension claims, and survivor claims. So we help them along the way.” -P11_

- The 21-22 is often filed with other forms. Depending on the context and the Veteran’s situation, the representative will make an initial determination about benefits eligibility and complete additional claims forms to submit as a package. **This is made before seeing the claimant’s e-Folder.** Representatives who file multiple forms at once say that risking duplicate submissions is favorable to not submitting anything with the 21-22. Reasons included:

  - Technology slowing access to the Veteran’s e-Folder

  - Not wanting to waste time establishing intent to file (ITF) 

  - Fear that the claimant will cease contact with the VSOrg after leaving their office

  - Additional research is needed to understand which forms are most often filed in a package with the 21-22 prior to POA being established

- _Quotes_

  - _“The power of attorney’s established as part of a package. Until which time we can regain the advantage of having power of attorney directly in the system, we submit it as a package, so we’ll submit the 21-22, the 526 EZ claim form, the associated forms for dependency, and so on, and then the documentation all goes in as a package into the \[QuickSubmit] portal.” -P1_

  - _“The number one thing is speed of access. There’s a lot of clients I would like to help when they walk in, but we can’t. I have to turn to them and say ‘here’s the form, fill it out. Follow up in two weeks.’ It’s so frustrating because you wanna be able to help them right then and there, but it doesn’t set the relationship off on a good foot.” -P3_

  - _“We always start out with the 21-22 form, in most cases we do submit an Intent to File right away to try and - depending on what \[the Veteran] is looking to do - it’s been better in the new system \[to file both].” -P6_

  - _“We have to submit, appeal and intent to file just to protect the date of claim. That’s things we do on a daily basis, until we get access to the record to determine what action we should take.” -P7_


### Key Finding 3

**VSOfficers need a certain amount of information about the Veteran before deciding to accept or decline an incoming power of attorney request.**

- Although VSOfficers are eager to establish POA for the reasons outlined above, there are critical data points about a claimant and their 21-22 request that VSOfficers want before making a decision on the request. Inability to access or confirm information prior to accepting the request can result in a rejected 21-22 by the VA, or slower access to the claimant’s e-Folder. Information includes:

  - The Veteran’s service record (particularly for reservists, national guard and claimants who have been separated from service for many decades)

  - Confirmation of what name, address, and other personal information the VA has on file

  - Confirmation of whether VBMS already has record of the claimant

- _Quotes_

  - _“In December \[I submitted a claim] through QuickSubmit and it was accepted by the VA, but the problem was, this individual had no BIRLS or corporate record. It went in blind. It’s like I’m just pointing my squirt gun at you, and it went left. So, although the system told us the claim was accepted, the person had no record. There was no acceptance of anything. \[...] It didn’t go into a system and populate into this person’s file. \[...] So in that situation I had to work with a Central Office member, we created his BIRLS and corporate record off \[of] the information I had, and then my representative was now able to submit \[power of attorney].” -P1_

  - _“We can log into SEP and see \[pending 21-22 requests]. We just can’t accept it in there until we can see all the information. And most of the time we have the information \[...] in VetraSpec. So we have a lot of information already and then we do use CRDIRS to pull those that we are releasing from retiring or discharging from military records.” -P2_

  - _“When the client visits our office, one of the first things we do is check and see if we have them in our system. And if we don’t we have a process where we create a profile for them. And then with that we’ll take their social security number, throw it into \[VBMS] and check to see if we have access.” -P3_

  - _“If a Veteran has a claim number which is like, Pre-1970 and before, the VA is not putting their \[social security number] in there. So you don’t know the claim number, and a lot of times they don’t \[either], because they’re old, and the VA hasn’t tied \[the SNN and case] together. This happened recently with a widow’s claim we couldn’t find. She didn’t know her husband had a claim number because he hadn’t had a VA claim for 40 years, and he’s been dead for 30 of those 40 years. She didn’t have any paperwork and we couldn’t find anything on file \[in Share].” -P6_

  - _“I think VBMS should at least come up and tell you that the person’s in the system \[without POA being established].” -P9_

  - _“A perfect example is when an individual, whether they’re male or female, marries another individual and then assumes the name of their new partner. Well, you have the old \[information in the system] and then the power of attorney will fail, because the names don’t match. \[...] it’s actually a rather common situation…QuickSubmit would not find that error. QuickSubmit would accept your documents with your new name and other information on it, but it won’t match what’s in the VBMS system so that information may go into a void somewhere and be rejected. But we won’t know that.” -P1_

* VSOfficers may reject or proactively contact a Veteran to resubmit a POA request if they feel it is in the best interest of the Veteran or claimant, or the best interest of the VSOrg not to establish POA. 

  - Reasons for rejection were rare but mostly pertained to fraudulent claims to the VA and violating a VSOrg’s terms of service. VSOrgs use the intake and 21-22 process to educate Veterans on those terms of service to avoid rejections and removal

  - Proactively communicating with a Veteran to resubmit a 21-22 to avoid rejection centered around access to Veteran’s records and being able to fully represent a Veteran in a claim

  - Additional research is needed to fully understand Veterans’ and VSOrgs’ actions in the rejection and proactive communication process

### Reasons why a VSOfficer may reject or proactively contact a Veteran to resubmit form 21-22:

- _Quotes_

  - _“We can’t properly assist anybody who limits our access…because the Department of Veterans Affairs cannot compartmentalize that information. So if they click we can’t \[access], we don’t get access to anything. At that point you have to tell them ‘well listen, you either have to let us have access to everything, or we’re not gonna be able to properly represent you.’” -P10_

  - _“The only thing we do not accept on a POA is if they restrict access \[to medical records]. \[...] With that restriction, we can’t, because the VA has no way of not allowing us to see that information in a claims folder, so they give us no access. Well, if we don’t have access, we can’t really represent you. And that’s fine, but we’ve had to tell somebody ‘hey, we can’t represent you.’ We usually explain the issue to them and they say ‘oh no, well, you can have access to my information.’” -P7_

  - _“The two check boxes on the 21-22 that authorize you to access the VA records and change the address. If they don’t want me to be able to change the address, I’m alright with that, but I also explain to them that getting into their records isn’t optional. If I can’t get into your records, there’s no point in us having this conversation anymore. It’s for VA purposes only. \[...Without change of address access] I can still access VBMS, I just can’t submit anything with a new address on it. That’s what that stops me from doing.” -P8_

  - _“We set out expectations \[with the Veteran] in that document. We say, this is what we expect for you. We expect you to be honest, we expect you to be respectful, we expect you to follow through with information, we expect you to communicate with us. And then things that you cannot do: you can’t be disrespectful; you can’t lie to the Department of Veterans Affairs; you can’t lie to your NSO; all those things. So we set those things out, and then they sign it, that way we have a record of us having that conversation, because Veterans can get a bit frustrated and you know, make threats. It’s very rare, but we do withdraw representation.” -P10_

* Currently, there is no centralized portal where VSOfficers can find relevant information about a claimant that they require before accepting power of attorney. 

  - While 3 participants said that they would accept all incoming requests without more context about the claimant, the majority wanted the ability to see additional information about the claimant and establish contact before accepting.

  - Participants listed 4+ tools they check to look up information about a claimant before making a decision

  - Some of the tools participants cited are being deprecated, and losing that access could negatively impact their workflows

### Systems VSOfficers use to verify claimant information before accepting a Power of Attorney request

### Key Finding 4

**After filing a 21-22, VSOfficers spend a lot of time manually tracking their access to a claimant’s e-Folder and the status of their claims.**

- Depending on the submission method, it can take anywhere from several hours to several weeks for a 21-22 to be approved by the VA and for VSOfficers to gain access to a claimant’s records. 

- _Quotes_

  - _“\[The POA process] takes a few minutes at most, maybe some emailing back and forth if it’s not collocated, but we’re talking weeks after submission until you get approval and access to VBMS. We’re saying \[to the claimant] ‘come back in one to two weeks, and then we’ll sit down and review your claim or shoot us an email and we’ll answer your questions.’ Having expedited access to files would be a game-changer.” -P3_

  - _“The issue with SEP is if we accept \[POA], we have instant access to VBMS. If we submit through QuickSubmit, we’re waiting 24-48 hours to get access to the record. So that Veteran’s in front of us and we need to provide assistance to that, we can’t do it unless we have access to the record.” -P7_

* Sometimes a person’s entire job (or a large component of their job description) is to check SEP for incoming 21-22 requests and VBMS for updates to claims in progress. 

  - Big 6 VSOrgs: participants cited national and regional service officers whose role is to accept incoming requests in SEP

  - State/county/regional: participants said that they have access to SEP through multiple accreditations, but may or may not have the ability to accept incoming 21-22 requests for all organizations through whom they are accredited 

* _Quotes_

  - _“Every office has to do it, somebody in every office has to go in \[SEP] and do \[check for POA requests]. It’s not ideal.” -P7_

  - _“I verify that \[power of attorney] was accepted by going into VBMS, seeing if it’s there.” -P11_

- VSOfficers create their own case tracking tools to monitor a submitted 21-22 since there are no reliable, automated tools for tracking them. Participants liked the case tracking features in VBMS, but said that the lack of filtering options specific to their workflows made it difficult for them to look at cases specific to their office’s region, such as:

  - Ability to view by assigned area instead of searching by individual zip code

  - Ability to view by [VA Regional Office](https://www.benefits.va.gov/benefits/offices.asp)

  - Other regional views, as dictated by the VSOrg’s internal structure and responsibilities for NSOs and VSOs

- _Quotes_

  - _“We put it on our calendars to go back and look, and that was the best \[option], I guess. There’s no good way to \[track 21-22s] short of maybe keeping a notebook, but then you have somebody’s social \[security number] sitting on your desk, which is why I’d rather put it in Microsoft calendar. In VetraSpec you can make tasks, but then your tasks get really long.” -P6_

  - _“In VBMS we have the notification queue that notifies us of actions that are taken on behalf of our clients. Whether it’s a rating decision, development, an exam, an exam is returned. Any of those things we have a notification queue in VBMS, we can see all of that. So every day we’ve got to go in there to review those notifications.” -P7_

  - _“We have our own case management software that we use \[to track cases]. All our counties have access to it, so that we can communicate back and forth. Because if a Veteran comes in from \[another county] and they happen to come here and want to drop off paperwork, we have the ability to use that case management software. I should say, everything’s web-based. So with it being web-based, we can leave our notes in there. We also do a courtesy email to the county officers ‘we’ve updated notes in the software.’ so that they’re aware of what we’ve done.” -P11_

  - _“The manual process is \[the claimant] either walks in or they email us or send a telephone call. SEP does not send us a notification that \[a 21-22] is pending. So it’s a physical process where you have to remember to go in daily and check it.” - P3_


## Tasks and Conclusions

The following findings are synthesized from participants’ responses to the participatory design prompts. Findings have been listed in descending order, from most common to least common responses.


### Task 1 / Provide easy access to the Accredited Representative Portal (ARP).

1. Participants wanted a web-based tool, preferably with a shortcut on their desktop. 

   1. One participant noted that a mobile application would be valuable when they’re working claims clinics and other events in the field

2. Participants wanted a tool that linked to other tools they use most frequently within the VA ecosystem, such as VBMS, to avoid toggling between tools during their workflow. In an ideal world, participants would like to see data from ARP integrated into other VA tools and databases and sync with their third party case management systems to avoid data loss and errors. (see tasks 4, 5, 6)


### Task 2 / Provide clear information on the ARP landing page.

1. Participants were confused whether account creation on the landing page was for representatives, or for claimants. 

   1. Participants assumed that if account creation was for representatives, that the account creation process would require inputting their OGC accreditation number 

   2. Being able to search for or see their accreditation number was an indicator of trust and security for participants

2. Participants thought that having quick access to FAQs, user documentation, and support on the landing page would increase trust in the tool. They also wanted to know when expected downtime and historic outages occurred so they could reference that when checking to see if a claim got lost in the submission process.

3. Almost all participants preferred to use their PIV to log in to ARP, or at the very least, assumed that PIV login would be the login method. Other login feedback included:

   1. Whether a separate login would be necessary if users were accessing the tool through the VA network

   2. Whether a non-VA network sign-in was possible for field work

   3. Whether any ARP functionality would be available before the login, such as searching for a claimant in CorpDB (currently accessible through BIRLS)

   4. One participant asked for a non-accredited login to allow volunteers or support staff to upload documentation


### Task 3 / Create a trusted yet distinct look and feel for a representative-facing tool on VA.gov.

1. There was some confusion about whether the landing page would include resources for non-representatives, or was meant for non-representatives.

2. Participants were unsure on how to make the experience visually distinct from the VA, but did say that VA branding would be an indicator of whether a tool was “legitimate or not.”


### Task 4 / Provide quick and easy access to POA and Veteran information on the dashboard.

1. Participants repeatedly said that the ideal ARP tool would be a “one stop shop” and integrate everything on the Veteran that would otherwise be spread across many tools, including information about their claims and their status, along with the ability to upload required documents, including forms and supporting evidence.

2. More than half of the participants wanted a search feature on the dashboard that would help them find a claimant. This is a common feature amongst existing accredited representative tools, and matches our hypothesis around their mental model for how they do their job, which typically begins with the individual. 

   1. Participants who regularly use SEP want the dashboard view to be as similar to the existing tool as possible.

3. Users implied that they expected the dashboard navigation to be task-oriented, and enable them to complete tasks such as:

   1. Review and approve new POA requests

   2. Search for Veterans

   3. Search for and review claims

   4. Adjust permissions/settings


### Task 5 / Empower users to accomplish top tasks.

1. Having a single power of attorney acceptance process was highly requested, with the goal of having “instant access” to a claimant’s files. When exploring the idea of a direct link from ARP to a Veteran’s e-Folder, one participant called it “gold plating” because of how special a feature that would be. Additional POA functionality requested included:

   1. The ability to view claimant- and request- specific information (see Task 6)

   2. The ability to communicate acceptance _and_ declination to the Veteran

2. Non-POA tasks participants expected in the tool included:

   1. Search for a Veteran, including:

      1. [End Product (EP) code](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000011474/Appendix-B-End-Product-EP-Codes?query=EP%20Codes), if they are established in VBMS and the VA has record of them

      2. Existing representation

      3. Discharge information

      4. Information about any claims for the Veteran, including those filed and appealed, as well as the type of claim, date of filing and the number of days pending on a decision

      5. VRO location

      6. Ability to update and edit claimant information, especially contact information, spouses/dependents and service information, and have that reflected in VA systems.

   2. Document upload and acceptance

      1. Participants ideally wanted the ability to send the claimant documentation, receive documentation (similar to DoD Safe) as well as submit documentation with forms to the VA

   3. View all claims, including dependency claims, with multiple filters.

   4. Pull data for reporting, including:

      1. How many claims were processed in a specific region

      2. Time spent by VSOfficers within a VSOrg on a claim

      3. Who in a VSOrg touched a claim

   5. Product and technical support, including

      1. A FAQ or tutorials

      2. Displaying contact information for technical support as well as information on who in the VA is responsible for maintaining ARP

      3. Version updates, warnings for when the system will be down, expected downtime, and historical downtime

      4. Potential information about training for ARP tool


### Task 6 / Provide Veteran details to support POA decision making.

1. Participants wanted specific information to support decision making around the Power of Attorney acceptance flow. Information fell into two categories:

   1. Claimant details confirming if there is a CorpDB record for a claimant (similar to BIRLS), including:

      1. Claimant name

      2. Contact information (phone number, email and mailing address)

      3. Date when data was last updated, to verify if it is current and accurate

      4. Ability to create a CorpDB record for a claimant prior to 21-22 submission, if none exists

   2. POA request details, including:

      1. Requested VSOrg, if VSOfficer is cross-accredited

      2. Whether the Veteran has allowed access to medical records and/or change of address

      3. Expiration date of a Veteran’s intent to file

2. If pre-existing representation exists for a claimant, participants want the following information in order to make an informed decision and take steps on behalf of the individual. This is part of VSOfficers’ goal to preemptively avoid declining a POA request.

   1. Who currently represents the Veteran

      1. If the VSOfficer’s Org represents them already, a link to the Veteran’s e-Folder

      2. If a different VSOrg represents them, who currently represents them (similar to Share)

   2. POA history, including any revocations, to determine if the Veteran is representative shopping.

      1. OGC number for the person who authorized the current POA

3. Participants wanted the ability to filter or create saved searches for their incoming POA requests, including:

   1. VSOrganization/filter by accreditation

   2. By state, county, and VA Regional Office

   3. Expiration date of a Veteran’s intent to file


### Task 7 / Information summaries.

1. Participants were asked what “quick hits” of information they would want on the dashboard to spur action around the tasks they would do in the ARP tool. Responses were divided into task- and Veteran-based functions, and have been captured in the findings for tasks 4-6 and 8. 


### Task 8 / Offer notifications.

1. Participants identified two types of notifications they would like the ARP system to populate: for VSOfficers, and for Veterans. 

   1. VSOfficers’ notifications would appear within the ARP tool when actions on the following were taken:

      1. New POA request

      2. POA has been updated

      3. Claims decisions and decision letters

      4. Pending ITFs that need to be completed and submitted

   2. Veteran notifications should be triggered when the below actions are taken by a VSOfficer in ARP. Participants wanted these notifications to appear in the Veteran’s VA.gov notifications, or in an email:

      1. POA has been accepted, with guidance on next steps

      2. POA has been denied, with guidance on why and next steps

2. Participants wanted control over notifications they would receive within the ARP tool to be specific to their accreditation(s) and work area, clear notifications, and be able to turn them on/off as needed.


## Additional Insights

1. The lack of consistent technological support for VA-provided tools has significantly impacted VSOfficer’s experience to effectively use them and caused doubt in the systems over time. 

   1. The lack of support, specifically a contact person at VA, is a huge pain point for many VSOfficers when using current systems, including SEP 

   2. Similarly, one participant asked for information about planned outages and a history of when the system has been down. They needed this information to convey to frustrated Veterans that it’s not the VSOrg that’s causing submission errors or delays in claims adjudication, it’s the systems they’re working within. This request reveals a history of problems with and resulting distrust in VA infrastructure

   3. We provide suggestions on how we might address this in Recommendation 5

- _Quotes_

  - _“What version \[ARP] is in; if there’s going to be any updates, any downtime that’s expected. \[...B]ut I would like to see a history of when the system is down, and what system is not down and I bring that up because it is such a time-sensitive world that we live in. If I go to my \[Internet service provider] account \[...] I can go and see a history of all the times there was an outage locally. Or if there was downtime scheduled and all that stuff. I like to see a history of that, because if I can’t get into the system, and you know it does happen, and you miss an ITF date. I want to be able to say ‘well, that wasn’t me, it was your system’ right? That’s just me being an advocate for the claimant.” -P10_

  - _“Anything to deal with how to reset your password. So if you lock yourself out, something to deal with it. Troubleshooting, those types of things. Because this is basically \[the] VA; if there’s contacts in case you have issues with this particular site, because if it’s not associated with VA IT, who do I contact if there’s troubles with this site? Who has ownership of this site? Because if the site’s down I can’t contact my CMA here because they don’t own it.” -P11_

  - _“I would know what to \[to do in ARP] because \[the VA] would have provided us the information. Basically, you train me how to use it, and I train my team how to use it. Then, based on how I work with my team, I’m gonna tell them ;you’ll go to representative.va.gov, you will sign into your account. If you do not have an account, you will establish one.’ And then they will know where to go.” -P1_

  - _“Even if \[ARP] had a FAQ, even, especially for new users. Almost like a tutorial. So because if I’m new to this, and I’m just logging into it, do you know what \[ARP will do]?” -P11_

2. Expectations of a new “accredited representative tool” may not line up with the reality of the MVP.

   1. In our discussions, several participants expressed interest in a tool that could serve as a "one-stop shop" for their work. However, our MVP will offer very few features, some of which VSOfficers already accomplish using other tools (e.g. using QuickSubmit to  upload 21-22 forms). Without having a communication strategy in place, our feature-limited MVP might lead some VSOfficers to assess that the new ARP tool does not offer any new functionality and prematurely decide not to use it 

   2. We provide suggestions to mitigate this risk in Recommendation 6


## Recommendations

This section is divided into two parts: Critical Recommendations for MVP and Future Considerations. The first part highlights our suggestions that should be incorporated in the coming months as part of our initial user experience. The second part highlights suggestions that are larger in scope and will require more exploration, yet are important to consider as the Accredited Representative Portal evolves over time.


### Critical Recommendations for MVP

1. **Match the distinct and varied ways our users prefer to work.**

We recommend that we design for the most common types of workflows, allowing employees of VSOrgs to have flexibility in how they manage incoming digital requests. Based on the current research, there are two ways that people work on POA requests: 

- A VSOfficer is often working with an individual and therefore seek out that person’s request, or 

- Someone within the VSOrg whose responsibility it is to field incoming POA requests will access the system regularly to scan through all the new requests and make a decision on them

2. **Provide VSOfficers with the critical data points they need in order to make an informed decision on a POA request.**

The accredited representative portal should reduce toggling between tools and facilitate faster decision-making around power of attorney requests. To that end, the below are the most requested data points that we recommend providing VSOfficers in our portal:

- **Claimant data points that should be prioritized for the MVP:** Claimant name, SSN, Claim number, Date of birth, Mailing address including City, State, County, Zip code, Phone #, Email, Current POA, Link to E-folder

* **POA request data that should be prioritized for the MVP:** Date of request, Requested VSOrg, Status (New/Pending, Accepted, Declined), If the claimant is granting access to health records

3. **Provide VSOfficers instant access to Veterans’ data.**

VSOfficers like to accomplish as much as they can during their meetings, so it’s critical that once a POA is accepted, our system provides VSOfficers with immediate access to their e-folder. The idea of having a link to their e-folder has come up and the feasibility is currently being explored. 

4. **Design a distinct look and feel for the tool that communicates reliability and trust.**

Given inconsistent experiences with representative-facing tools in the past, the new ARP tool and its landing page need to clearly convey who this tool is for and the actions they can take upon creating an account and logging in. 

- Make sure non-accredited Veterans know where to go if they find themselves on the landing page

- Branding should tie into VA.gov while also clearly being a non-Veteran facing tool

  - Additional research is needed to understand how to communicate the experience

5. **Provide trained, dedicated staff and resources to support technology.** 

The new ARP tool has the ability to combat the distrust that VSOfficers currently feel toward VA-provided technology, due to the current lack of technical support and contact personnel. VA should provide trained and easily-accessible technical support staff to help VSOfficers resolve technical problems. 

- Ideally, this support would be offered via multiple channels (e.g. phone support, email support, and chat support) to accommodate the different needs and contexts in which VSOs work 

  - Demonstrating that VA has allocated resources to support VSOfficers with this new tool will help build confidence and trust that switching to this new tool is worth VSOfficer’s time and energy 

- We also recommend including user-centered system documentation, helping new users orient themselves to the experience and find answers to common challenges. This proactive support would reduce potential burden on whoever will be in charge of technical support 

  - Possible solutions could include in situ support, like tooltips, that users can utilize while they’re performing a specific action. Considering this sooner rather than later will ensure that the proper documentation is in place and the necessary people/teams are established pre-launch

6. **Instill trust through the use of informative system responses.**

Building in these moments of clear communication will enable VSOfficers trust in the product. The verification alone will help VSOfficers know that what they did “went through”, eliminating the current behavior of performing certain actions multiple times, which ends up bogging down the systems and causing further delays.

- When an action is performed by a user in the system, we need to clearly communicate the result, including if any changes were made on the backend, and/or any subsequent action that their action may have prompted

  - If an error takes place, the user needs to be made aware that something went wrong and what they can do (if anything) to resolve the error 

- This feedback needs to be communicated immediately (ideally), in the section of the tool in which they are working

7. **Communicate the long-term goal of the new tool and encourage continued engagement.**

VA can mitigate hesitations or anxieties VSOfficers may feel towards the new ARP tool by clearly communicating to VSOfficers that they are committed to supporting and improving this tool in partnership with VSOrgs. 

- The ARP release could look like:

  - Framing the release as an MVP, with more features to come 

  - Communicating the long-term vision of the tool, including highly-requested features like integration with other VA tools 

  - Providing transparency about upcoming features and expected release dates

  - Posting an open invitation for any user to offer feedback or participate in feedback sessions and usability studies  

  - Allowing VSOfficers to suggest and/or vote for features 

- Simply releasing the tool will be a missed opportunity. Instead, VA should grasp the chance to build a story around the tool and create a community of users who are invested in its evolution and eagerly await the next update


### Future Considerations

1. **Design for end-to-end workflows.**

Currently, the POA process spans multiple tools, between the actions taken by VSOfficers and claimants as well as the data points needed along the way. Ideally, VSOfficers should be able to complete a series of tasks from beginning to end within one system. While the POA process will initially span at least two tools, our recommendation would be that in the future, the entire experience, from the first step to the last, takes place within one tool. 

2. **Consider integrating as much functionality as is feasible within a single tool.**

In an ideal world, VSOfficers would not be required to jump between many different tools as they are supporting Veterans. They would be able to do most or all of their work from a single tool.

- While we are not in control of the third-party tools that VSOfficers utilize, we do know that one of the benefits of them is that they bring a lot of the data points about a Veteran and necessary functionality to support them in one place. The more we can do this as we build additional functionality into ARP, the more competitive we become as a product for accredited representatives 

  - We also must be mindful of the capabilities that third-party tools lack in different places, so additional research to better understand representatives’ unmet needs will make ARP a highly valuable component of their work

3. **Consider non-standard contexts of use.**

Non-accredited support staff as well as non-PIV card holders would also benefit from functionality provided by ARP. 

- Additional research is needed to continue to explore what various contexts and use cases might apply and design with those in mind


## Next Steps

1. Update top tasks and user stories to reflect data-driven insights

2. Evaluate feasibility of feature requests and scope MVP

3. Update MVP screens to include top tasks

4. Test updated task flows with top tasks and recommendations


## Further Research Needed

1. In future research, include VSOfficers with less field experience. Target recruitment to also include:

- More diverse representation within Big 6 and smaller VSOrgs. 

- Representation from more state, county, and tribal VSOrgs.

- Representation from Assistive Technology (AT) users.

2. Address open questions from this research study to deepen our understanding of VSOfficers and better refine the ARP tool for their needs:

- Role types:

  - Our research was conducted with VSOfficers who are working on an individual claimant workflow, however, we have heard that several VSOrgs have “super users,” whose job description includes bulk approval or rejection of incoming 21-22 requests. Does the ARP system need workflow- or task-specific navigation for user users?

  - We know that some staff have PIV cards and authenticated login credentials and others do not. How important is it for non-accredited employees and volunteers to log into the ARP system?

- VSOfficers with multiple-accreditations: 

  - Is it common for VSOfficers to be accredited with multiple VSOrganizations? Because of this, there is a need for them to understand which organization’s lens they are working within, especially since claimants’ power of attorney, when working with a VSOfficer, is tied to the organization, not the individual.

    - Additional exploration is needed to better understand which level this division needs to occur, spanning from the system level down to the task-specific level. 

  - Do they want to view POA requests for a single VSOrg at a time, or are they comfortable viewing a complete list of POA requests and filtering by VSOrg as needed?

- All VSOfficers:

  - How will VSOfficers respond to various modifications to the VA “look and feel”? 

  - What specific changes (e.g., change in color, imagery, etc.) will make it sufficiently clear that the ARP system is not for non-accredited Veterans, but that it is still a trusted VA asset?

  - How are third-party tools meeting or not meeting users’ needs as identified in this research and the [current state service map](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1701101229797/15c7e1a5a9d426a998eb634408ff1dd3f4f9bdd1?wid=2-1706565924181)?
