# Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today, and thank you for signing up to give feedback to the VA about their software products for accredited representatives.

My name is [Laura/Kate] and I’m a researcher working on improving VA digital tools so accredited representatives can better support Veterans. [Laura/Kate] will be joining us to take notes. I also have a couple other colleagues who are listening in to learn.

- Briefly introduce team and then ask that they turn off their cameras.

Today we're going to ask you to give feedback on a web application for accredited representatives.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

* This entire session should take **about an hour**.
* In this session, **we want to hear your honest opinions**. There are **no right or wrong answers**; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We are testing how intuitive this tool is so I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
* In this session, I will be asking you at times if something is clear or unclear; if something is better or worse than how you currently do something. **State one option that reflects your honest opinion**.
* **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary**. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
* For part of the session today, **we will have you share your screen** so we can follow along with how you use the prototype. If you are not able, we can share our screen and walk through the prototype that way.
* **We would like to record our session** if that’s OK with you; we use the recordings for team members who were not able to be with us today and also to go back if our notes are unclear. We will not share any part of the video outside of our team without your permission and we have practices in place to safeguard any PII and PHI we may record. The findings we report will not include your name or any attributions to you.
* **Is it ok with you if we record this session?**
  + If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.
* Ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

\*Start recording.\*

* OK, the recording has started. **Just so we have it on record, is it OK for us to record our session?**

# Warm-up Questions (2 min)

* Before we get started, how are you doing today?

# General Questions (15 min)

*Note: The following is a set of question we ask for at the start of each ARP study to gain more context about representatives*

* Can you tell me about your role at [ORG NAME]?
  + How long have you been in this role?
* Which organizations are you accredited with now and why?
  + [if multiple] Is there one you consider to be your primary organization? Why?
  + [if unclear] Which organization are you employed by?
* Is one of your responsibilities establishing representation?
  + If yes, what tools do you use to establish it?
  + What does limited and general POA mean to you?
    - How often do you encounter limited POA and why?
* When do you ask Veterans to sign the forms for submission (such as the 21-686c, Compensation, Pension, or other forms) and when do you sign on their behalf? When do you want both your and the Veteran’s signature on the form? Why?
  + Do you use electronic signatures?
  + How do you handle this when in-person? Not in-person?
  + Does this change by form?
* Have you experienced an instance where you didn’t include a piece of evidence for a claim, like a 526, that you already filed? And what did you do next? Why?

# Evaluate Navigation of site (15 min)

The VA released a tool that allows Veterans to submit 21-22 digitally online through VA.gov. Veterans log into VA.gov to appoint a representative online; they can select an organization and representative then submit a 21-22. Then, accredited representatives can log into VA’s new Accredited Rep portal to view and accept those 21-22s and send claim information online.

Now we’re going to share with you just the high-level navigation of the Accredited Rep Portal and ask you some questions about it.

## Navigation tasks

[Note: The artifact to share will be a tree diagram of the site, and show under Find Claimant, Claimant overview, submit forms, and submission history] Now I’m going to share with you a navigation view that has a little more detail.

For each question, let us know which part of the navigation you would visit to complete the action based on the scenario. If there is a task where you think you could possibly go to two places, let us know which ones and why.

* You want to file a 526EZ for a Veteran, where would you go? Why?
* A Veteran wants [insert the participant’s organization] to support them through and file a compensation claim on their behalf. The Veteran completed the 21-22 online through VA.gov, and you’ve heard these should be visible in this portal. Where would you go to view this 21-22? Why?
* A Veteran calls, asking to see if you can double check that form and documents were sent to the VA, that you sent through this portal. Where would you go? Why?
* You’ve experienced inconsistencies with logging into the portal and would like to know if they can be resolved. Where would you go? Why?

## Navigation closing questions

* For those tasks where there was more than one option to complete the task (Checking on the documents submitted, and finding 21-22s), ask why they only chose that one option.
  + What about the phrase [insert Navigation item they chose] makes you think that?
* Overall, how confident are you in your ability to navigate this site on a scale of 1-5, 1 having no confidence to 5 having complete confidence. Why?
* How could this be improved?

# Evaluate claimant search (5 min)

For these next sections, we will ask you to comment on a prototype of this new accredited rep portal. Not everything will be clickable. What we’d like you to do is think aloud. Tell us what you are seeing, if it's what you expect to see, and especially tell us about anything that is confusing or unclear.

For this scenario, let’s pretend that you are a cross accredited rep with the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs and with American Legion. You recently had a meeting with Veteran Brooks Santiago. After a conversation with him, it sounds like you can be of assistance. Brooks recalls working with a state Veteran Service Officer before at some time, but is interested in working with American Legion now, and you mentioned you could help either way. At the end of the conversation, Brooks files a 21-22 online with American Legion through the appoint a rep tool. You go to the Accredited rep portal to review it.

### Homepage -> Find Claimant

For the first part of this conversation, we are going to start from the homepage. You log-in using [login.gov](http://login.gov).

* What do you expect to see after you log in? Why?
* What is your reaction to landing on this page?
* What would you do next?
  + Note: If they say they would go to Representation Requests, ask them what they would expect to happen from there. Then ask if this section of the portal wasn’t available at the time, what they would do next. We won’t have time in this study to explore all routes.
  + Continue with the following questions in the section, Find Claimant.

### Find Claimant

* What is your reaction to the fields requested on this page?
  + What other information do you typically search by when searching for an individual in VA systems or third-party tools?
  + Does number of required fields presented here feel too few, too many or just about right? Why?
* How could this search be improved?
* What do you expect to see after entering in Brooks’ information and clicking Search?

# Evaluate Claimant Page - Accept POA request (5-10 min)

### Claimant page

[Note: the page that should be shown will have one pending request alert, one with ITF expiring soon]

* What’s your reaction to this page?
* What would you do next from this page? [Mark/Tally response as success if they would go to the pending request based on the alert]
* Can you tell me, in your own words, what the section “General POA information” tells you?
* What requests do you expect to see under “Recent Representation requests?”
  + Do you expect to see requests for organizations you do not have accreditation with? Why or why not?
* What is your opinion of the information shown about ITFs?
  + How could this information be improved?
* What other types of alerts or notifications would you expect to see in this yellow box?
* What information would you like to see on this page, that would make it more valuable than your current solution?

# Evaluate Submission Flow (10-15 min)

Let’s say, based on Brooks’ scenario, that you helped him complete form 21-686c to add dependents. So you now have a completed form, that was signed, on your computer as a pdf. You’d like to submit this through this new portal. Let’s say again you log-in, and you land on this “Find Claimant” page. What would you do from here?

[[Link to prototype with all flows for testing](https://www.figma.com/proto/APOPs9bzbrIcbKXjV8Xnu8/ARF---Claimant-page---search?node-id=1437-269647&p=f&t=aOcm83WfPZHtbylz-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=1435%3A269407&starting-point-node-id=1437%3A269647&show-proto-sidebar=1)]

### Claimant page (revisited after accepting request)

* Now that you’ve accepted the representation request and you’re about to file a claim for Brooks, is there any additional information you expect to see on this page? Why?
* What would you do next?
* What would you expect to see when you click on “Submit forms?”

### Submit forms page

* Is this what you expected?
* Looking at the different ways to submit an ITF, what do these mean to you?
  + Which option would you use? Would you need both options? Why?
  + When do you expect each type to show up in the VBMS eFolder?
  + Is it important to know the difference? Why?
  + How would you refer to these different ways of submission, in your own words?
* After clicking on “Start submission through form upload tool” under Form 21-686c, what do you expect to see next?

### Claimant background and upload files

* Is this what you expected to see?
* *(Optional based on time) How could this page be improved?*
* What do you expect to see after clicking “Continue”?

### Review and submit

* Is this what you expected to see?
* *(Optional based on time) How could this page be improved?*
* What do you expect to see after clicking “Submit”?

### Confirmation page

* Is this what you expected to see?
* *(Optional based on time) How could this page be improved?*
* What would you do next after this?

### Closing questions for this section

* Now that you’ve walked through this, how would you compare this approach to the current way you are using to submit [VA form].
  + What is the current way you would submit this form?
  + Is it better, worse, or the same? [Mark/tally response] Why?
* Does this seem faster, slower, or about the same as your current approach to submitting the 686c? [submit [VA form]] Why?
  + [If they state that it is worse or about the same] What would compel you to use this tool over your current method?

# Evaluate Claimant Search - No results (5 min)

In this scenario, let’s say you had a phone call with Veteran Anderson Ward and wanted to see if you had POA with Anderson with one of your accredited organizations. You’d like to see if you could access more information about him through this portal. What would you do next?

[Note: this prototype will show the “No results” option]

* What is your reaction to these results?
* How clear is your next step? Why? How could this message be improved?

# Closing questions (3 min)

For our last part of our session, we have a few closing questions.

* What were the main points of confusion or frustration that you experienced? Why?
* If you could wave a magic wand for the VA to create a portal that helps representatives support Veterans through claims submissions what would it be?
* Would you and your organization be interested in piloting this tool?

## Consent to use video clips

* I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video or audio clip of this session with our VA partners? In all cases, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on these products to make sure they meet your needs.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

* We’re primarily interested in folks who are using QuickSubmit. If you haven’t used it before, we can end this session early, and I’ll update our database on tools that you use.
* Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
* Plan for a backup moderator.
