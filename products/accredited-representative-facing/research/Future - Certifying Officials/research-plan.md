# Research Plan for Accredited Representative-Facing (ARF) Team, VSO Certifying Officials, Date TBD

## Background

Research to date has enabled the Accredited Representative-Facing Team to build useful profiles of  the people whom VA empowers  to consult and advocate on behalf of Veterans. The resulting personas provided invaluable insights into the user needs of:

* [Accredited attorneys](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1717533456497/60064424f651818203ff49ac43d6fb9f0f2bccac?sender=u2a4240a640b257ce33545495)
* [Accredited claims agents](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1718731869465/cf73b89eddb92c604d292554a31e503f7ce5d982?sender=u2a4240a640b257ce33545495), and
* [VSO representatives](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1709236473099/7a69ce07dbe58af30f1954470bebbe59b7bf1160?sender=u2a4240a640b257ce33545495)

Those insights  in turn informed design and development of the Accredited Representative Portal. 

While we have a good picture of how Veteran-facing stakeholders do their work, and what would help them to do it better, we  know considerably less about the certifying officials who manage their accreditation. 

To  date, the team has only had the opportunity to solicit impressions and feedback from a single certifying official. While this participant’s feedback  provided insights enough to suggest a direction for future research, it has also highlighted the parts of workflow, business processes and VA internal rules that we need to understand better. 

We hope this preliminary plan will suggest a useful direction for future research studies with these important VA/OGC stakeholders. 

### OCTO Priorities

**Grow digital submissions** / Focus on the needs of accredited representatives, and the Veterans who work with them: After years of focusing exclusively on Veterans who want to interact directly with VA, we will build tools for Veterans who want to work with accredited representatives, and the reps who support those Veterans. In doing so, we will redirect to VA.gov traffic currently going through eBenefits and Stakeholder Enterprise Portal (SEP). 

Full list of [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md).

### Veteran Journey

Any/all points when a Veteran needs support filing and accessing their benefits.

## Research goals and questions

* Gain a better understanding of the day-to-day work, concerns, and pain points faced by certifying officials so that we can build a persona for this user type (similar to our VSO representative persona)
* Fill in gaps in our understanding of the certifying official’s role in the contact update process
* Collect certifying official’s thoughts and perspectives on an [updated set of mockups for updating VSO representative contact information](https://www.figma.com/design/RbVQnV4eBl2K1Z5xRpZi7H/ARF---Contact-Info-Updating?node-id=325-164088&t=lJYcpwxVRyWR76yJ-1) 

### Outcomes

* A persona will be created for the certifying official user type
* We will have validated design decisions or exposed previously unknown usability issues with the updated mockups for updating VSO representative contact information 

### Research Questions

Below is a partial accounting of information gaps around certifying officials that merit further investigation.

#### Learning about certifying officials

**Email addresses**

1. We know that VA/OGC discourages representatives from using their VA email as their business contact email address. 
    1. Has this rule been documented, and if so, where?
2. Aside from being a prerequisite for obtaining a PIV card and gaining remote access to the VA network, are there **other contexts** in which a representative would need to access or supply their VA.gov email?
    2. Example: Are there communications that would only come to the representative via their VA email account?
3. What other rules govern the use and display of accredited representative email addresses? For example:
    3. How many alternate email addresses could a representative enter into their profile?
    4. What purpose would these alternate email addresses serve?

**Home and business addresses**

1. If a representative doesn’t conduct business out of their home, would there ever be any reason to display their home address on their public profile?
2. How does a certifying official learn of changes to the representative’s business contact information?
3. How often do representatives use a PO box as their default mailing address?
4. What are your thoughts about if we should list both a physical address and a mailing address for representatives on FAR?

**Renewals and notifications**

1. How do certifying officials determine if the representative they are planning to cancel for non-renewal has received timely notification at their correct address?
2. How much visibility does the certifying official get into those outreach efforts prior to canceling the representative’s certification?
3. How often does cancellation occur because of failed notification?
4. What is that like for the certifying official?
5. What would they need to feel more confident that they were canceling accreditation correctly?

**Cancellation "for cause"**

On the rare occasions that accredited representatives exhibit extreme unprofessional behavior, a certifying official may have to cancel that individual “for cause.”  

1. Is the term “for cause” generally understood and commonly used?
2. What evidence, steps, and sign-offs are required to complete this procedure?
    1. Of these, what could the certifying official supply online?
3. What notifications does the certifying official receive to indicate this might be necessary?
4. Who are the responsible stakeholders making this determination?
5. What sort of follow-up notification and/or status report  does the certifying official after instituting this sort of cancellation?

**Challenges arising from cross-certification**

Our single certifying official participant from our [last study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/accredited-representative-facing/research/2024-07%20OGC%20Contact%20Information%20Updates) indicated that it’s one challenge to find which representative is certified by what agency. Moreover, they need to  trust that the individual’s certification bona fides are listed currently and accurately both at VA and the other organizations involved. 

To better serve certifying officials, representatives, and the Veterans on whose behalf they work, our UI needs to reflect an understanding of how certification works across these empowered organizations. That means we need to learn more about:

* People in the pipeline
* Actions and approvals
* How, when, and why of communication
* Touchpoints and handoffs

…and of course, the day-to-day challenges users face in navigating this web of responsible agencies and stakeholders. 

#### Usability testing

Because we only tested with one certifying official in our[ last round of testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/accredited-representative-facing/research/2024-07%20OGC%20Contact%20Information%20Updates), we can leverage a similar usability test with this round of certifying officials. 

## Methodology

**Semi-structured interviews** / The interviewer will ask the certifying official a series of questions to gather insight into their experiences, workflows, and policies. Questions will be customized depending upon the participant. 

**Concept testing** / The interviewer will show the certifying official some visual concepts of what updating contact information could look like in ARP. The certifying official will be prompted for feedback around authentication, flow and navigation, content, and any interactive elements.

**Location** / Online, over Zoom

### Conversation guide

(No conversation guide has been created for this study yet. See the [2024-07 conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representative-facing/research/2024-07%20OGC%20Contact%20Information%20Updates/conversation-guide.md) for context on the past study that included certifying officials.)

## Recruitment

It is suggested that the next research team recruit a cohort of no fewer than five certifying officials.

## Timeline

The timeline will be dependent on when a future team decides to begin this work. The below timeline is a suggestion.

1. ##/## Prep research plan and discussion guide; prepare prototype (if needed); share with Enablement team and OGC
