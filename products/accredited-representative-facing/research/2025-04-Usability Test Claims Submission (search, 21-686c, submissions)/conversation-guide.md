# Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today, and thank you for signing up to give feedback to the VA about their software products for accredited representatives.

My name is [Laura/Kate] and I’m a researcher working on improving VA.gov- so accredited representatives can better support Veterans. [NAME] will be joining us to take notes. I also have a couple other colleagues who are listening in to learn.

- Briefly introduce team and then ask that they turn off their cameras.

Today we're going to ask you to give feedback on a prototype of a website/app that helps representatives submit form 686c for dependents and view submissions history.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

* This entire session should take **about an hour**.
* In this session, **we want to hear your honest opinions**. There are **no right or wrong answers**; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We are testing how intuitive this tool is so I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
* In this session, I will be asking you at times if something is clear or unclear; if something is better or worse than how you currently do something. **State one option that reflects your honest opinion**.
* **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary**. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
* For part of the session today, **we will have you share your screen** so we can follow along with how you use the prototype. If you are not able, we can share our screen and walk through the prototype that way.
* **We would like to record our session** if that’s OK with you; we use the recordings for team members who were not able to be with us today and also to go back if our notes are unclear. We will not share any part of the video outside of our team without your permission and we have practices in place to safeguard any PII and PHI we may record. The findings we report will not include your name or any attributions to you.
* **Is it ok with you if we record this session?**
  + If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.
* Ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

\*Start recording.\*

* OK, the recording has started. **Just so we have it on record, is it OK for us to record our session?**

# Warm-up Questions (2 min)

# Evaluate E2E usability of submitting 686c (15-20 min)

Moving onto part 3 of our conversation, let’s say that the VA releases a new portal that helps accredited representatives submit claim information online and accept POA requests.

**For this session**, we will be sharing a link to a prototype of this new portal. Some parts are clickable, some are not, and you won’t be able to type inside any empty fields. What we’d like you to do is, as you go through this activity, think aloud. Tell us what you are seeing, if it's what you expect to see, and especially tell us about anything that is confusing or unclear.

## Scenario Adding Dependent

For this prototype, let’s pretend that you are a rep with Wounded Warrior and are working with someone new, John, a Veteran who would like to add his 18 year-old daughter as a dependent. You’ve heard you can do this through this new portal. So you log in by clicking on this link. [Share link below]

Prototype link: https://tinyurl.com/5b7achc6

### Starting page – Search claimant – Yes POA

* What is your reaction to landing on this page? What would you do next? [Mark/tally as success if they continue the search, mark as no success if they go to “Submission” page]
* What do you expect to see after entering in John’s information and selecting “Search”
* Go ahead and click on “search.” Is this what you expected to see? Why or why not? What would you do next?
* What do you expect to see on the page when clicking on submit 686c?

### Intro page (686c)

* Go ahead and click on “Submit 21-686c.” Is this what you expected? Why or why not?
* What would you do next?
* Would you download the form or would you already have the form ready to upload? Why? [Mark/tally response]
* Is the level of instruction on this page necessary, nice to have, or not needed? [Mark their response] Why? What specifically is not needed?
* What do you expect to see, after you select “Start uploading form”

### Submit Page - Fill in information (686c)

* Is this what you expected? Why or why not?
* When the postal code pre-populates like this on VA tools, have you ever needed to edit it? Why?
* What do you expect to see after clicking on “Continue?”

### Submit Page - Upload (686c)

* Is this what you expected?
* Is everything on this page clear or is something unclear? [Mark/tally response] Why?
* Let’s assume you dragged the form over. Go ahead and click in the first drag file here box.

### Submit Page - Form mismatch (686c)

* What is your reaction to this page? Why?
* What would you do next? [Mark/tally as success if they noted they would check the file name, to confirm the error message is clear].
  + If they don’t notice that the error message changed, mark as “no success”
  + **If they don’t notice the alert,** draw their attention to the alert and ask what this means to them, what they would do next.
* Let’s say you upload supporting evidence. Go ahead and click in the second drag file here box.

### Submit Page – Review and submit

* Is everything on this page clear or is something unclear? [Mark/tally response] Why?
* What would you expect to see after you click on “submit form”? Go ahead and click on it.

### Submit (686c, success)

* Is this what you expected?
* When do you think this 686c will show up in VBMS? Why?

### Closing questions for 686c

* Now that you’ve walked through this, how would you compare this approach to the current way you are using to submit 686c. Is it better, worse, or the same? [Mark/tally response] Why?
  + Does this seem faster, slower, or about the same as your current approach to submitting the 686c? [Mark/tally response] Why?
  + [If they state that it is worse or about the same] What would compel you to use this tool over your current method?
* Would you expect this flow to change, to account for your cross-accreditations?

# Evaluate usability Submissions page with 686c (10 min)

## Scenario Reviewing Submissions history

Moving onto part 4 of our conversation, let’s say that a few days after you submit the 686c for John Snyder, John calls you to check and make sure that the submission went through. You log back into the accredited representative portal. What would you do next? [Mark as success if they navigate to Submissions]

### Submissions History view – John Snyder - Card view with submission status only

* How would you respond to John?
* Is the information clear or is something unclear? [Mark/tally response] Why?
* What does the term “packet” mean to you?
* When do you think John’s 686c would appear in VBMS, now that you see this card? [If it different from their original estimate based on the 686c flow, ask why.]
* What does claim submission status mean to you?
  + What does this status mean to you?
* What would you expect to see if you selected “Print confirmation?” Why?

### Submission History view -

* When do you think Grayson’s 21-686c packet would appear in VBMS? Why? [If they state that it is there based on “received”, mark as unclear. If they state that it would be there at some future date because this is only tracking submission, mark clear]
* What does this status mean to you?

### Submissions History view – Paula Higashi - Card view with submission status only

Let’s say that another claimant Paula Higashi calls you to check and see if where her 686c is at. What would tell her, based on what you see on this page

* What would you do next when you see Action needed?
  + If they say they would go to the Get help section, ask what they would look for

### Submissions History view – 60 days - Card view with submission status only

Let’s say that Joshua Miranda asks you to check on the status of his 686c. Joshua is someone you helped file a 686c for in January of 2025.

* What would you do next? Why? [Mark as clear if they understand this only shows 60 days of information]
* What do you think about this length of time? Why?

### Submissions History view – general

* Looking across all the cards and the information presented, what information on the card is a must-have, nice-to-have, or not needed? Why? [mark/tally response]
* We’d like to know if this approach to reference a past submission feels fast or slow. Does this seem faster, slower, or about the same as your current approach to reviewing what you’ve submitted? [Mark/tally response] Why?
* What would you expect to be able to sort by? Why?
* Does this view change, if you are cross-accredited?
* If they didn’t understand “packet” - explain to them that it refers to the form and evidence they submitted, and ask what word they would use to call this.
* If they didn’t understand that “received” is only based on submission to central mail, ask what they would call this.
* If they didn’t note the 60 days, refer them back to the message and ask their opinion of it.

# Closing questions (3-5 min)

For our last part of our session, and we have a few closing questions.

* What were the main points of confusion or frustration that you experienced? Why?
* Was anything exciting for you to see? What and why?
* If you could wave a magic wand for the VA to create a portal that helps representatives support Veterans through claims submissions what would it be?
* Would you and your organization be interested in piloting this tool?

## Consent to use video clips

* I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video or audio clip of this session with our VA partners? In all cases, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

* We’re primarily interested in folks who are using QuickSubmit. If you haven’t used it before, we can end this session early, and I’ll update our database on tools that you use.
* Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
* Plan for a backup moderator.
