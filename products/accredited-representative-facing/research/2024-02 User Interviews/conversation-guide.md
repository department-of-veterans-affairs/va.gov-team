## Intro - 5 minutes

Hi [NAME], thanks for joining us today! How’s your day going so far?

_Wait for response_

My name is [NAME] and I’m a researcher working on improving VA.gov so accredited representatives can better support Veterans. [NAME] will be joining us to take notes.

Before we get started a few things I want to mention:
- **This session should take about an hour.** We’ll be focusing on your experiences as an accredited representative working with Veterans. The first half of the hour will be me asking you questions and learning more about your experiences, and the second will be more interactive where we’ll be looking at a rough mockup of a digital tool together and building out some ideas of what a future experience might look like if we were designing something together today. 
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions to improve digital tools so that they better meet accredited representatives’ needs.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback. I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation is completely voluntary.** If for any reason you want to stop, or do not want to answer a question, please let me know. 
- **During today's interview, we may discuss experiences that have caused serious frustration.** I do want to know about those experiences in case there are processes we can improve in the future, but they are not experiences I can help with directly. 
- **Knowing this, I have [#] teammates in the waiting room on Zoom who would like to observe our session, but only if you're comfortable.** Would that be okay, or do you prefer to keep the session to just the [#] of us?
    - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    - If yes: Admit observers.
    - Then, ask the observer(s) to give a brief, camera-on introduction, first name and position with VA.gov.
    - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observer(s) to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.
- **Are you ok if I record my screen and audio as we talk today for analysis and reporting purposes?** We like to record to make sure we’ve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at the VA to show user feedback. If we do this, we don’t link anything you choose to share in the session to any information that identifies you, and we remove your face and name from any videos that we share.
    * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_Start recording in CAG. Enable record to cloud._

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Do I have permission to record my screen and the audio as we talk today for analysis and reporting purposes?


## First Task: User Interview - 30 minutes

_Warmup_

1. Let’s get started: what is your current role and what organizations do you support?
2. How long have you been working in your current role?
3. Would you mind reminding me, are you Active Duty or a Veteran?

I’d like to shift gears now. The next set of questions will be focused on how you do [JOB TITLE].

_Top tasks and workflows: current state_

4. Walk me through a typical day working with Veterans (or other accredited representatives), from morning to when you go home/log off.
    1. [If unclear from response] What tools do you use in your work with Veterans?
    2. [If unclear from response] What are the top 3 tasks you’re helping them with?
    3. [If unclear from response] What do your responsibilities include outside of directly assisting Veterans?
        * How much of your time is spent doing these tasks?

Thinking about the typical Veteran you support, the next questions will be focusing on what engagement looks like, from seeking representation to benefits received.

5. Walk me through the process of obtaining Power of Attorney for a Veteran or family member, starting from when you first connect with them. What does the process typically look like for you?
    1. Going back to the POA, how long does the PoA request and acceptance process take?
    2. What tools do you specifically use to prepare and submit a PoA request? Paper forms? Fax? Online submit?
        - Where are you managing claimants once the PoA has been submitted?
    3. How are you receiving notifications about incoming PoA requests?
    4. After the POA is in place, what typically follows? What are the first tasks you’re doing with a Veteran?
    5. How long, on average, do Veterans wait to hear from a representative after contacting you/your organization?
        - How are Veterans contacting you?
    6. In your opinion, what are the Veterans’ expectations of you as their representative? 
        - How do these expectations match the reality of how you work together?
    7. What are your top 3 frustrations or challenges with providing effective and efficient support to Veterans?

Thank you for sharing your experience with Power of Attorney and supporting Veterans. The next set of questions are going to focus on how your organization uses tools to manage representation.

_Org-level permissions_

6. Are you able to select your own Power of Attorney requests, or are they assigned to you?
7. Who in your organization approves and assigns incoming 21-22 requests from Veterans or claimants?
    1. [If _they_ do] What information do you need about the claimant before you can make?
    2. [Ask to all] What is this experience like for you? Any challenges?
    3. On the 21-22, Field 16 there are boxes to indicate the VSOrg the Veteran wants to appoint, but it also asks for the representative’s name. Have you ever encountered a Veteran who wanted to appoint a specific VSOfficer at [ORG]?
    4. What information about the claimant do you need to know before you can make a decision on whether or not to accept the 21-22?
    5. Are there reasons why a POA request would be denied?
        1. In this scenario, what happens?
        2. Is the denial communicated to the Veteran or family member?
        3. How often are requests denied?
        4. Is this preventable? If so, how?
8. If you were to design a new experience for representatives to manage requests in order to support Veterans’ claims, who in your organization should be able to handle accepting incoming 21-22 requests?
    6. [If unclear] Would this experience be the same or different from your current system?
9. [If an accredited rep at a VSO or firm] Does your organization have different user permissions for using [SEP/the tool]?
    7. Who is allowed to accept/decline a 21-22 within your organization?
    8. What other levels of user permissions does your organization have for [tool]?
    9. If you were to imagine a brand new tool for managing representation requests, what would you change about the current user permissions that would make your organization more successful?
10. Before we move onto our next exercise, do you have any questions or anything else you’d like to share about your work as an accredited representative?


## Second Task: Participatory Design Session - 20 minutes

Thank you for sharing your experiences being an accredited representative with me. I’d like to shift gears to an interactive portion of our session, where we’ll brainstorm ideas around what would help you and other accredited representatives better support Veterans. 

I am going to share my screen to show you some very **early** designs in progress. Nothing here is decided on, it’s meant to be a jumping off point for us to imagine what _could be_.


### Screenshare Prompt & Tech Support

- [Link to Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1706127153075/2a5b791fb4bcd9667d98daaa9586211ea2eab234?sender=u503219bf4e47eab9c75d3838)

_Share screen **from Desktop**, open onto Mural zoomed in on the participant’s session. Keep white paper over each prototype._

Can you see my screen?

_Wait for affirmation._

Some things I’d like you to keep in mind before we get started:
- These designs do not have any functionality and are missing details like color, content and navigation. Any words or cards you see on the screen are subject to change so we’d like your honest feedback on what **you need**.
- As we look at the designs, I am going to ask you to imagine certain scenarios where this tool is fully designed and tailored to your needs as an accredited representative. 
- Bear in mind, I’m asking you to imagine the **perfect** system made for you. For the time being, you do not need to be concerned with whether or not what you’re thinking is possible – we want you to dream big. So whatever you’re thinking, we’re hoping you can describe in detail as best as you can.
- Lastly, you can see my mouse inside the screen. I’m going to be using digital sticky notes to capture your feedback as we go. I may ask you for specifics on where you want to see a specific design or feature. You can interrupt me at any time to make sure we’re capturing your feedback as accurately as possible. I will also be watching this footage back later to make sure I didn’t miss anything.
- Do you have any questions?

**_Authentication/distinct design_**

1. Before we jump into our first screen, let’s imagine you sit down at your computer to do your work as a [role], and you go to access the system with all the tasks you need to do your job. Where do you ideally go on your computer to access that system? 

_Display the landing page to the bottom of the fold, where it says “sign in.”_

2. Let’s say you go online to login, as you just described, and this is the first page you see before logging in. What are your first impressions?
3. What information do you need on this page **before** you log in?
4. [If the representative is a Veteran] As a Veteran, do you use VA.gov for any of your own claims?
    1. This tool is meant to be for accredited representatives, and not a Veteran-facing tool. As a Veteran, when you’re using this system, what would make it clear to you that this system is for professional use managing representation and not for managing your own benefits and claims?

_Display the remainder of the landing page_

5. What else would you like to see on this page, bearing in mind this is a public-facing page?

**_Dashboard ideation_**

Thank you for your feedback on the landing page. Let’s take a look at a homepage concept next.

_Remove the white paper from the homepage_

6. Imagine you just logged in to your new system and this is your personal homepage for a tool that helps you manage representation requests. What information do you expect to find here?
7. What would you consider your top 3 tasks you need to accomplish from here?
8. Let’s imagine a scenario where you’re logging into the tool to look at incoming requests for representation. What information would you want to be able to see about Veterans to help you decide whether or not to accept that request on behalf of your organization?
9. If you had a magic wand, what would you want to see in this tool that would significantly improve how you currently support Veterans?

Thank you for your feedback. I have a few more questions for you.

**_Notifications_**

10. What stats or “quick hits” of information would you want to see if you’re quickly checking the system? What critical information or updates would you want to be alerted of?
    2. [If they didn’t mention it] Anything related to power of attorney?
    3. Where would this information ideally live?
11. Imagine a Veteran has called you asking about the **status** of their claim. Where would you expect to find that information?
12. Anything else you’d add to these screens that we didn’t talk about?

_Stop screen share._


## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Any questions for me?


## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
    - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on developing the tools that help accredited representatives assist Veterans and their beneficiaries.

I wanted to ask, if you know of anyone else at your organization who would be interested in providing feedback on new tools for representatives? It does not have to be a senior-level person or someone with extensive experience. We want to make sure we’re collecting feedback from everyone who would be benefitting from these tools. 

[Wait for response]

Our team will be sending a thank you email, where we’ll provide a link to our feedback intake form, which you can share with your colleagues.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!


## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it's easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]

- **Out of questions:** We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
- **Blame technology**: I am so sorry, but I just learned that the [website/prototype/thing I wanted to test with you today] is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.
- **Backup Moderator**: This is best to practice beforehand, but can work if there is an emergency with the moderator. Appoint another team member who will be on the call as the backup moderator. You can say “for the next part of this session [backup moderator name] will moderate.” They should be prepared to jump in if something happens to you or you are not comfortable to finish the session.
