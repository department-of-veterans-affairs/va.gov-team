# Research Plan for Representative Facing Team, User Interviews, 02/2023

## Background

The Accredited Representative Facing Team is seeking to re-envision the Accredited Representative experience so that they can more seamlessly and accurately help Veterans with their VA benefits interactions, including helping Veterans apply for, manage, and update their VA benefits.

Our initial focus is on the process of accepting the Power of Attorney (PoA) given in Form 21-22 which appoints a Veterans Service Organization (VSO) as a Veteran’s representative, giving them PoA.


### OCTO Priorities

**Grow digital submissions** / Focus on the needs of accredited representatives, and the Veterans who work with them: After years of focusing exclusively on Veterans who want to interact directly with VA, we will build tools for Veterans who want to work with accredited representatives, and the reps who support those Veterans. In doing so, we will redirect to VA.gov traffic currently going through eBenefits and Stakeholder Enterprise Portal (SEP).

Full list of [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md).


### Veteran Journey

Any/all points when a Veteran needs support filing and accessing their benefits.


## Research Goals

- Understand the biggest unmet needs and pain points for representatives that end users desire and need addressed in a new tool for supporting Veterans’ claims.
- Determine how to design an experience that is visually distinct from VA.gov, for accredited representatives who are Veterans.
- Identify user tasks flows, prioritize features and initial navigation for the MVP.


### Research questions

- How is SEP (or third party case management tools) used to support the complete Veteran claims process?
    - How are VBMS (Core, -R and -A) and other systems used in conjunction with SEP or like tools, and what cross-functionality is necessary for the new rep-facing tool?
- What task flows are essential to accepting or declining a Power of Attorney request from a Veteran or claimant?
- What information and calls to action do accredited representatives expect to find on the dashboard of a tool for supporting Veterans claims?
- What notifications, if any, do accredited representatives need to action PoA requests?
- How do VSOrgs handle permissioning between different levels within the organization, and how would a tool to support organization-wide PoA provide differing levels of access?


### Outcome

- Information on accredited representatives’ behavior in their regular work supporting Veterans and expectations for the new tool will be used to inform user flows, future state mapping and creation of the tool’s navigation.
- Qualitative design feedback will be used to create an initial mockup of the MVP, specifically the landing page, dashboard, and PoA accept/decline pages.

## Methodology

**Semi-structured interviews** / The interviewer will ask the representative a series of questions to gather insight into their experiences and knowledge. Questions will be customized depending upon the participant. Remote on Zoom.

**Concept testing** / The interviewer will show the representative current low fidelity prototypes for the SEP replacement in Mural. The representative will be prompted for design feedback around primary/tertiary navigation, essential tasks and features.


### **Location**

Online, over Zoom. Point of contact is Renata Keck, UX Researcher/Designer.

## Recruitment

As this will be the first of many studies involving accredited representative users, the ARF team will be using this study as the first of many opportunities to develop a research panel.  


### Recruitment approach

Broadly speaking, our intended audience is any accredited representative who supports Veterans. Within accredited representatives, the ARF team had identified the following key groups whose input is essential in the creation of a SEP replacement:

1. **Accredited Representatives: Big VSOs** / Large, national VSOs are pretty organized and have existing tools, processes, and training for their Representatives. They include Disabled American Veterans (DAV), American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), AMVETS, Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA), Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA), and Wounded Warrior Project (WWP).  
2. **Accredited Representatives: Small VSOs** / Local, state, county, and regional VSOs have fewer resources and fewer standard processes in place. They include CalVet (one of the few states with both state/county level VSOs), Texas Veterans Commission (formerly SEP users), and others.

Recruitment will involve leveraging an advisory group convened to discuss migrating from the SEP system, hosted by Martin Caraway, VBA VSO Liaison, on January 23, 2024. The ARF Design team will be given access to an email list for targeted recruitment following that listening session. 

During the listening session, the ARF Design team will introduce ways representatives can provide feedback throughout the design process. Draft messaging for recruitment can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qytwUkiUPbZ_7XCTci8J4j-kUJwhSelqmAP6pqORbyo/edit?usp=sharing).

**Recruitment criteria**

3-5 accredited representatives from each major user group. 6-10  interviews total. 

Primary criteria (must-haves)
- Mixture of novice and experienced users
- Mixture of urban and rural accredited representatives

Secondary criteria
- Mixture of Veterans and non-Veterans


## Timeline
- [x] 12/20 / Prep research plan and discussion guide
- [x] 1/23 VSO Listening Session, distribute email address for signing up for feedback sessions
- [x] 1/29 Contact representatives to schedule user interviews
- [x] 1/31 Refinement of design artifacts for participatory design session
- [x] 2/1 Pilot session, refinement of conversation guide and design artifacts based on feedback
- [x] 2/5-2/16 Conduct interviews, analysis 
- [x] 2/29 Reporting and presentation
