## Intro - 5 minutes

Hi [NAME]! Thanks for joining us today! How’s your day going so far?

*Wait for response*

My name is [NAME] and I’m a Researcher with VA working on creating accredited representative-facing tools on VA.gov so folks like yourself can apply and manage your accreditation and better support Veterans. [NOTETAKER NAME] is my colleague and they will be joining us today to take notes. 

Today we're going to talk about the process of applying to be an accredited [Claims Agent/Attorney] and your experiences with that process thus far.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

* **This entire session should take about an hour and fifteen minutes.** The first part of the session will be asking you questions about your experiences, and then after that, it will be more interactive, where you’ll be sharing your screen and giving us feedback on a new digital accreditation application. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* **You'll be interacting with a mocked up version of the Form 21a application for accreditation today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your [current/future] application for accreditation or your standing with VA Office of General Counsel. None of your responses will be reported to OGC. This will not be the entire digital form and we will be jumping around and focusing on certain sections of the application.
* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions about becoming accredited.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
* **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** If for any reason you want to stop, or do not want to answer a question, that’s totally up to you. Please let me know. 
* **During today’s interview, we may discuss experiences that have caused you serious frustration.** I do want to know about those experiences in case there are processes we can improve in the future, but they may not be experiences I can help with directly. 

Do you have any questions?

*Wait for response*

* **I have [#] teammates in the waiting room who would like to observe our session, but only if you’re comfortable.** Would that be okay, or do you prefer to keep the session to just us?
    * If no: Use the Slack thread to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    * If yes: Admit observers.
    * Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
    * Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
* **Are you ok if I record my screen and audio as we talk today for analysis and reporting purposes?** We like to record to make sure we’ve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at the VA to show user feedback. If we do this, we don’t link anything you choose to share in the session to any information that identifies you, and we remove your face and name from any videos that we share.
    * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

*Start recording from the VSO-ARF Zoom account in CAG. Enable record to cloud (**not** locally).*

* **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Do I have permission to record my screen and the audio as we talk today for analysis and reporting purposes?

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

You'll be interacting with a prototype today. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Can you tell us why you want to be accredited with the VA?
2. Where or from whom did you learn about what to expect in the accreditation process?
3. Have you ever applied for accreditation before?
    1. If yes, how long ago? 
    2. What happened? In your own words, can you describe your experience?
4. Have you started on the application yet?
    3. In your own words, can you please describe your experience so far?
5. Do you have any concerns or anxieties about the application process?

## First Task: Understanding the landing page - 10 minutes

I am now going to send you a link in the Zoom chat. Please click on this link, which will open a clickable prototype. [ADD FIGMA OR STAGING LINK]

Once you have the prototype open, please use the green “Share” button in your Zoom toolbar to share your screen with me.

**Sign in: Figma** **Frame Sign in-01**

Please take a moment to look through this page. I encourage you to think aloud as you are going through what is being presented to you.

1. What are your initial impressions of this page? What stands out to you? 
2. What do you think you can do here? Why?
3. In the header, what does the word “portal” mean to you?
4. Please look at the teal message that starts with, “This form talks about personal history…” 
    1. What does this message mean to you?
    2. What are your thoughts on this message?
5. Please look at numbers 1 through 9. (If previous questions take a long time to answer, skip this question)
    3. Can you explain each one to me in your own words?
6. How long do you think this form will take you to complete?
7. From this page, what would you do next?
8. How do you expect to sign in?
9. Anything else you want to share about this page?

You may now click the “Continue” button at the bottom of the page. (After each subsequent question, prompt the participant to click the “Continue” button to advance to the next stage of the prototype.)

### Things to watch for:

* Participants definition of “portal”
* How participants feel about wording

## Second Task: Personal Information - 10 minutes

**Personal Information: Figma frame Step 1-01**

You are now signed in and are beginning the application.

1. Please read this page and think aloud. Does this raise any questions? Is anything unclear?

**Personal Information: Figma frame Step 1-06** (Which role are you applying for?)

1. In this case, let’s pretend you are applying as an attorney, even if you’re applying as a claims agent.

**Personal Information: Figma frame Step 1-07**

2. In your own words, can you describe to me what “good standing” means?

**Personal Information: Figma frame Step 1-08**

3. Please read the message in red. In your own words, can you tell me what this message is saying?
    1. Does this message make you want to/not want to do anything?
4. Can you think of any instances where an attorney not in good standing with the bar will apply?

**Personal Information: Figma frame Step 1-17**

5. First checkbox (“This is the residential address I want OGC to keep on file…”): What does this checkbox mean to you? 

**Personal Information: Figma frame Step 1-19**

6. Second checkbox (“I still live here”): What does this checkbox mean to you?
7. How do you think these two checkboxes are different (if at all)?
8. Can you think of a case where you would check one box but not the other?

**NOTE: For future tests, we need to test the accessibility of these checkboxes for AT users.**

## Third Task: Employment Information - 5 minutes

**Employment Information: Figma frame Step 3-01**

1. Please read this page and think aloud. Does this raise any questions? Is anything unclear?

**Employment Information: Figma frame Step 3-09** (Note that this page should be modified in the prototype to say “Are you currently working in a federal position”)

1. For the sake of this prototype, let’s select “Yes.”

**Employment Information: Figma frame Step 3-10**

2. Please read the message in the yellow container. Can you tell me what this means in your own words?
3. Why is this message important to someone applying?

## Fourth Task: Professional Affiliations - X minutes

**Professional Affiliations: Figma frame Step 5-07**

1. (For future tests, we need to test the accessibility of selecting “Other” followed by a free form text box with AT users.)

## Fifth Task: Background Information - 5 minutes

**Background information: Figma frame Step 6-01**

**NOTE: Update these designs with [feedback from Midpoint Review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/milestone/1398) and test to see how users respond to trigger warning content and complicated language.**

4. How (if at all) is this preview useful for you?

## Seventh Task: Review Information - 10 minutes

**Review: Figma frame 10-01 Review (Collapsed)**

1. NOTE: This is best tested in clickable prototype or staging (as opposed to static images). Test the usability of users having to go back into earlier steps of the application to edit their information, especially from information stored in cards, like past residences, employers, periods of military services, education, and character references.

**Review: Figma frame 10-02 Confirmation**

2. Please read through this page and think aloud. What does this mean to you? Does anything stand out?

2. Can you summarize your overall experience?
3. Do you have any questions for me?

## Consent to use video clips

* I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
    * If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

## Thank You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

I wanted to ask, if you know of anyone else who is planning on or has recently applied for accreditation who would be interested in providing feedback? We want to make sure we’re collecting feedback from everyone who would be benefitting from these tools. 

_Wait for response_

Our team will be sending a thank you email, where we’ll provide a link to our feedback intake form, which you can share with your colleagues.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it’s easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]

* **Out of questions:** We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
* **Blame technology**: I am so sorry, but I just learned that the [website/prototype/thing I wanted to test with you today] is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.
* **Backup Moderator**: This is best to practice beforehand, but can work if there is an emergency with the moderator. Appoint another team member who will be on the call as the backup moderator. You can say “for the next part of this session [backup moderator name] will moderate.” They should be prepared to jump in if something happens to you or you are not comfortable to finish the session.
