# Research Plan and Conversation Guide for National Association of County Veteran Service Officers (NACVSO)

# Research Plan

## Background

The Accredited Representative Facing (ARF) Team is building an Accredited Representative Portal (ARP) for representatives to provide timely, accurate, and responsive support to Veterans and non-Veteran claimants. ARP enables Accredited Representatives to efficiently manage their interactions with the VA, including digitally submitting claims, accepting powers of attorney, helping Veterans manage their claims and appeals, and managing their accreditation. ARP ensures that Veterans and claimants receive the benefits they deserve quickly and confidently.

The ARF team is attending the National Association of County Veteran Service Officers (NACVSO) July 14-July 17, to grow awareness of ARP and learn about representatives’ needs to inform future features and solutions.

### OCTO Priorities

**VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits**. We will build tools for accredited representatives to submit claims and supporting documentation more effectively and efficiently.

## Research Goals

* How do representatives typically learn about a tool like ARP?
* What can we learn about representatives’ case management, form signature workflow, their communication with ROs, and use of digital tools that will inform future solutions in ARP?
* What can we learn about representatives’ communication with OGC?

## Outcome

This research will inform how we can disseminate ARP and also improve our understanding of representatives’ needs to inform future features.

## Methodology

1:1 brief intercept interviews, with each day focusing on a different set of questions.

* The purpose of the intercepts is to gather more information about specific topics that have been under discussion.
* Data gathered from brief intercepts does not replace in-depth interviews; they inform us of context, provide general direction, and help us identify better questions to ask during in-depth studies.
* The expected length of these sessions is between 5-15 minutes.

A brief open-ended survey that allows for anyone to share ideas for ARP.

* This survey allows anyone, whether or not they take part in 1:1 conversations, to share ideas for the portal.
* We expect that data gathered from this survey would cover a wide range of topics at different levels. This data too, can help us identify and continue to confirm certain opportunities for ARP.
* We would not prevent people from submitting the survey multiple times.
* At the end of the survey, we will ask if people would like to receive updates about the ARP Portal and upcoming releases.
* Because the survey consists of optional open-ended questions, we expect the survey to take between 3-10 minutes.

## Location

# Conversation Guide

For each day, facilitators can start with the following conversation starter.

* I’d like to learn more about your experiences with VA and VA tools if you have a few minutes.

To switch topics, facilitators can use the following transitions.

* Thank you for sharing; that’s very helpful to hear. I wanted to learn more about a separate topic that we’ve heard other representatives mention, if you have the time.

Note: Based on what we learn we may remove or change the order of questions.

## Monday – Wednesday

### Marketing ARP

(Objective: To understand how and where to share news about ARP)

We’re trying to figure out how to get the word out to Service Officers about portal features we are rolling out.

### Case Management

(Objective: To understand if and how we need to design solutions for representative assignment.)

* We’re curious about how a specific Veteran gets assigned to a specific representative within an organization. Who establishes POA with claimants within your org?
  + Do you establish your own POA, or does someone else establish it and then assign you to specific claimants?
* How is it determined which representative would work with which Veteran? Why?
  + Is there someone at your organization who assigns cases?
  + Territories, zip codes, etc…
* What tool do you use to track what rep is assigned to what case?
* Are you familiar with VA’s Appoint a Rep online tool, where Veterans can submit 21-22s online and select a preferred representative?

    - If yes, what did you think about this tool?

## Day 2 Tuesday Questions

### General communication with OGC

(Objective: Explore opportunities for portal regarding how representatives communicate with OGC.)

* We’re curious about Veteran Service Officers’ relationship with Office of the General Counsel – OGC, and if that is something that we can address in this portal. What do you communicate with OGC about? Why?
* How do you communicate with OGC?
  + Through email? Through another person at your organization?

* What email would you want to receive notifications from the portal?
  + For 21-22 status?

* Does anyone from the RO send messages to you about the claim, that would have changed how you submit it? (e.g. we have a new rule, where you have to submit this to qualify for that). If so, what are they and why?
* Do you get messages from anyone at the RO that you think should be easily resolved, based on what you sent? If so, what are they and why?
