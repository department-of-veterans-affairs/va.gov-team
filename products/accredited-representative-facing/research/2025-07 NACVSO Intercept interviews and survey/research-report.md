# Background

The Accredited Representative Facing (ARF) Team is building an Accredited Representative Portal (ARP) for representatives to provide timely, accurate, and responsive support to Veterans and non-Veteran claimants. ARP enables Accredited Representatives to efficiently manage their interactions with the VA, including digitally submitting claims, accepting powers of attorney, helping Veterans manage their claims and appeals, and managing their accreditation. ARP ensures that Veterans and claimants receive the benefits they deserve quickly and confidently.

The ARF team attended the National Association of County Veteran Service Officers (NACVSO) July 14-July 17, 2025. CVSOs attend this annual event to acquire learning credits to maintain their accreditation status; NACVSO is a central organization in the CVSO’s ecosystem that provides training.

Our team’s purpose was to grow awareness of ARP and learn about representatives’ needs to inform future features and solutions. We had a booth, that included large printouts of ARP screens, a demo video of ARP, 8.5 x 11 information flyers, quarter-page reminders to check their contact information, and a paper survey that we also distributed digitally. We also shared these materials through the conference app Whova.

# Research Goals

* How do representatives typically learn about a tool like ARP?
* What can we learn about representatives’ case management, form signature workflow, their communication with ROs, and use of digital tools that will inform future solutions in ARP?
* What can we learn about representatives’ communication with OGC?

# Executive Summary

Because our intercept interviews were scattered, based on VSO’s availability, interest, willingness to chat, the information presented here should be considered as directional. The findings shed light on workflow context, and often confirm and add to existing knowledge about County Veteran Service Officers.

Also, our recommendations are limited to the selected interview topics, which are based on unknown areas or areas that needed further confirmation. We also were not able to include important questions related to dependent claims, workflows when representing Veterans who do not have access to digital tools, and others.

# Participant sample

About 500 County Veteran Service Officers attended NACVSO in person, and about another 500 attended the conference remotely. Most CVSOs we spoke with were cross-accredited with more than one organization, such as Disabled American Veterans (DAV), American Legion (AL), and Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW).

We engaged with about 125 people at the conference; our engagements included brief encounters sharing awareness of Appoint a Rep and ARP and requesting that they check their contact information. We also talked more in-depth with about 35-40 individuals, many of which were at our booth. During our engagements, we noted that we were able to find CVSOs with less experience at this event relative to our existing panel.

We received 18 responses to our survey about features and pain points, including 5 claims agents and attorneys. While claims agents and attorneys were not at the conference, National Organization of Veterans’ Advocates (NOVA) distributed the survey to their members.

Well over half of the VSOs we spoke with use third-party tools such as Vetraspec, TVB (another Tyler Tech tool), and VetPro.

# Key Findings and Recommendations

## For updates on tools, CVSOs pay more attention to news from state associations and Regional Offices (RO) over other channels.

*We discussed this topic with about 11 CVSOs.*

Overall, CVSOs reacted with excitement to the message, that Veterans could send a 21-22 online (without having to download and print), that VSOs could accept it, and within minutes see the Veteran’s file in VBMS.

The following is a list, in general order of priority, of what could be most effective to raise awareness of ARP to CVSOs.

1. Many CSVOs noted their state-level association communications. In a model where operations are centralized at the state level, these state VSOs pay attention to state VA emails. In a model where operations are centralized at the county level, VSOs pay attention to their state associations’ updates. Messages sent through these channels’ emails and websites would both be valuable.
2. For those CVSOs who had good relationships with the RO (e.g. regular monthly meetings, trainings for VSOs), they recommended that the leadership at RO announce news of ARP.
3. One CVSO also encouraged us to have a 15-minute announcement at the NACVSO conference.
4. CVSOs did not check their federal va.gov email on a regular basis, nor did they review these emails in detail. So while a few noted federal VA emails and VA news as an option, they are not the ideal means of communication.

In response to SEP’s sunsetting, CVSOs showed concern over losing SEP’s immediacy of dependency establishment and distribution of benefits. CVSOs wanted to know when ARP would establish 21-686c in the same way SEP does. Similar to prior studies, CVSOs emphasized using SEP for establishing the 21-686c, even though it is an outdated tool.

**Recommendation:** Plan for communication with on a state level as well as with Regional Offices. If possible, include any known expectations of when 21-686c would be auto-established. If we are seeking at a minimum to mirror SEP usage, we would prioritize establishing the 21-686c through RBPS.

## Accessing Veteran’s information in general, was the most frequently noted pain point in the survey

In their ideal world, CVSOs wanted to see a Veteran’s files regardless of the POA, before meeting with the Veteran. One CVSO asked if they could see information that could be requested through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), so they could gather some context to assist the Veteran prior to POA acceptance, especially for Veterans who are difficult to see in person or connect to.

* “It’s dumb that I have to steal POA back from DAV to see what is going on and the 21-22 gray screen of death that interrupts the appointment for 25 minutes to build situational awareness on what they have filed for, what they have been denied… to develop the path forward.” — Idaho CVSO from Whova conference app

They noted other issues with access, one of which is solved through our current POA solution.

* Seeking instant approval and access when a 21-22 is submitted
* Inability to see documents section in VBMS even though they are accredited
* For attorneys and their teams to get easier access to Veteran’s files. For attorneys, POA is held by individual (based on survey comment), which makes it challenging to support attorneys within a law firm. Also, legal assistants would also be able to access Veterans files as well, even though they are not directly filing on the Veteran’s behalf.

Four CVSOs and attorneys and claims agents also wanted an easier means to access Compensation and Pension Record Interchange (CAPRI) and Veterans Health Administration (VHA) records.

**Recommendation:** Understand POA access problem space for claims agents and attorneys and ensure that the solution meets their needs. (Note: Executive Director of Nova Diane Rauber would be a good resource for this). Continue to improve login access for all accredited representatives.

## While we still see a variety of workflows related to permissions, we gained a little more confidence in our decision to deprioritize permissions-related features.

*We discussed this topic with about five CVSOs and VFW.*

In January 2025, we wanted to understand whether or not features related to permissions were a high priority. We decided to deprioritize these features after a review of prior data and discussions with SMEs (See [January Memo on Roles and Permissions](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/%3Aw%3A/r/sites/vaabdvro/Shared%20Documents/Accredited%20Representative%20Facing/Permissions%20and%20Administration/2025%2001%20Roles%20and%20Permissions%20Memo.docx?d=wf08cd75fcb4747b98981e72d66cc7402&csf=1&web=1&e=cysS7v)). These features would enable another individual at the organization to review and accept/decline representation requests, and enable a supervisor to review forms prior to claim submission. Based on a few discussions with CVSOs and VFW representative, we continued to build a little more confidence in this decision.

Most CVSOs we spoke with could sign the 21-22 themselves. Minnesota CVSOs were an exception. To manage POA requests within their organization, an individual at Minnesota Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) will sign the POA.

CVSOs, when cross-accredited with different associations, follow the rules of that organization. For instance with VFW, CVSOs send claims to them first (via secure email) for review; American Legion requires them to submit to them first via a specific upload tool and review those files before submitting through QuickSubmit.

Also, from NACVSO and from prior studies, we know that newer representatives (<6-8 months experience) notify their supervisors to review their work. Vetraspec for instance, may enable a view where supervisors can see the work of their representatives (Kentucky CVSO). After this review period however, representatives can submit files on their own without review.

**Recommendation:** Features that allow for POA assignment and supervisor views are likely lower priority than other features on the roadmap given these are less frequently used. They would be considered a future enhancement. We acknowledge that Minnesota CVSOs may not choose to use ARP for form submissions without further permission rules, however some organizations like Minnesota CVSOs could self-manage who on their team can review and accept POAs to use ARP in its current state .

## When cross-accredited, CVSOs decide which organization should hold POA based on needs of Veterans and whether or not their organization needs this information. There does not appear to be an established standard of practice.

*We discussed this topic with the Legislative Director for NACVSO and referred to a conference poll with 35 participants.*

CVSO cross-accredited reps often select organizations other than their primary to file claims, which can lead to reporting and tracking issues.

They cited multiple reasons for why they select a certain organization to file with, including Veteran preference, enabling Veterans to move around to different county officers in the state (when using American Legion), unappealing paper processes for NACVSO, NACVSO’s quality training and American Legion's high-quality practices for appeals.

A poll on the conference app which asked, “Which POA do you prefer to use”, showed the following open-ended responses.

* “My understanding is that NACVSO, unfortunately, does not have staff who assist with Higher Level Review information conferences, nor Appeals, nor a legal agreement in place with a law firm to take on the Board of Veterans Affairs (BVA appeals) either.”
* “American Legion, because if I have to go Direct Review to the VBA, their Appellate Briefings are phenomenal.”
* “We have our own POA [in Colorado] and use that exclusively… to run reports and report to our Governor on our productivity.”
* “I use them all, I let the client make the decision.”
* “American Legion, because every county officer in state it accredited through them and it makes it easier for them in the future if they move or need to move around VSOs.”

Michael McLaughlin, the Legislative Director for NACVSO and also a CVSO for Blue County, MN, noted that this contributes to NACVSO and CVSOs inability to report productivity and to tracking fraud. There is no way to promote accountability and report productivity by organization and individual accredited representative because claims are assigned by organization and do not include individual, and because individuals are not selecting the organization that employs them.

In the recent legislative act 118-196 approved December 2024 titled “Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2024,” Section 4 suggests that in the future, the VA may further monitor and support governmental VSOs (including state/county/tribal VSOs). In ARP, tracking both the POA code and OGC registration number separately from the general POA that the Veteran is represented by, would help VBA track claims according to the individual and organization responsible for them with greater accuracy than the current state. Given that VA has four years to implement rules after a law passes, this law does not impact current priorities but the team should remain informed.

**Recommendation:** Most representatives we spoke with did not raise this concern, nor have we heard it from any Veteran-facing research. However, if VA and/or VSO leadership considers this a key issue to tackle, we should discuss when we want to address this in ARP, and what we would impact.

## Claims agents communicate the most with OGC, followed by attorneys and then CVSOs. CVSOs generally had no reason to contact OGC.

*We discussed this topic with about 10 CVSOs and NOVA’s Director.*

NOVA’s Executive Director noted several reasons why claims agents and attorneys communicate with OGC.

* Claims agents communicate the most with OGC because they do not have licenses like attorneys, nor are they part of an organization. So they have more examinations with OGC and may have more continuing legal education (CLEs) to earn and send to OGC.
* Certain types fee agreements need OGC approval while other types do not.
* Law firms experience access issues; for instance when paralegals are assisting with the work they also need to obtain PIV cards.
* Attorneys and claims agents may at times submit evidence to OGC’s email address
* When several attorneys are assisting with a case, OGC will decide how fees are distributed across attorneys

OGC is clearly overburdened with all the tasks that they are responsible for, given they have to handle accreditation with VSOs, attorneys and claims agents as well as complete these other tasks.

Most CVSOs we spoke with repeatedly stated they did not communicate with OGC directly, nor did they need to. One CVSO from a Colorado county stated that OGC isn’t directly related to his job; his focus is on his list of Veterans.

When asked how they would update their contact information, they noted the following options. Some were not familiar with the term “certifying official,” others could intuit who this individual was at their organization.

* Most stated they would reach out to their state representative or the person in the county who handled accreditations.
* A smaller number of CVSOs (2) mentioned that they reached out to OGC directly to update their contact information. An Oregon CVSO stated that their state DVA was very slow with updating contact information, so they reached out herself to remove organizations from her account, which was successful.
* One stated they reached out to the National Service Director at NACVSO to update his zip code.
* Some stated they did not know how to update their contact information, and asked our team how they would do this.

CVSOs from Michigan wondered if they would need to update their contact information with all the organizations they are accredited with or if they would have to reach out to each organization’s certifying official. They would like to update their contact information for NACVSO and for that change to apply to all their accredited organizations.

When they made an update request through their state, county or OGC, they did not always know whether or not their contact information was updated. We spoke with a few representatives who noted that they updated their contact information, but wasn’t sure if it was updated, which prompted us to show them the Find a Rep tool.

**Recommendation:** Provide a clear transparent path towards updating contact information for all representative types, that would 1) provide confirmation of the changes and where they will show (e.g. to show Veterans on Find a Rep tool, to update OGC website) 2) Communicate whether or not their contact information changed for all their accredited organizations 3) How other cross accredited organizations would be notified, or ensuring that contact updates change across all organizations a representative is cross-accredited with.

ARP can also include in on the Help page how representatives can currently update their contact information.

Conduct research to understand more in-depth claims agents and attorneys’ journeys with OGC so that future features for these types of representatives can be prioritized, designed and implemented.

## CVSOs preferred using their county email over all others.

*We discussed this topic with about six CVSOs.*

The CVSOs we spoke with used their county email on a day-to-day basis and rarely, if ever use their VA email. One CVSO who was cross-accredited with VFW uses the va.gov email for secure communications when filing under VFW. They need to send VFW a copy of the form submitted, and they use va.gov to send this. We also heard from 2 reps that they will use their va.gov email to send them documents securely to their county email.

When representatives become accredited, they wait 5-7 months to get access to VA systems; during this time they have no access to their va.gov email. Also, a representative noted that while he uses his county email, he also gets emails to his personal email address though he has no recollection of entering it anywhere. Another representative stated that he might have entered his personal contact information on the accreditation form, but could not recall.

**Recommendation:** For CVSOs, we should ensure that notifications can be sent to their county email. On the accreditation application, make sure potential representatives understand how their contact information will be used.

## CVSOs prefer (and many appear to) have a good relationship with the regional office to raise concerns.

*We discussed this topic with about seven CVSOs and one VSO and one RO Supervisor.*

NACVSO further confirmed that many representatives prefer to reach out to ROs for concerns. Of the 8 CVSOs we spoke with, only a Mississippi CVSO stated they do not get support from their RO. Ideally, CVSOs can assist with finding errors without causing too much interruption, that would prevent the claim from being sent to higher level review or appeal.

CVSOs could help improve the quality of claim review at the ROs as well as expedite urgent claims, but we also heard from one RO and a few CVSOs, that VSOs can be perceived as disruptive especially when they message claims processors directly.

* Indiana CVSO sends messages to the RO when they see something wrong and point to evidence (e.g page x on the Statement of Record) that a VSR or RVSR missed. He stated that it was important his tone was “kind” and not “adversarial”
* VFW, who can have VFW employees working from the ROs, encourages VFW to meet with the RO teams and build relationships.
* Michigan CVSO has meeting with the RO every two months. VSOs will Teams message the VSR working on the claim or sometimes leadership at the RO. A few VSRs will reach out to VSOs directly requesting for information.
* RO leadership manages processors’ workloads, so the Kentucky RO supervisor preferred that messages be sent to the supervisor email or to the Veteran Service Center at the RO, rather than direct messages to VSR and RVSRs. He noted that VSO messages are often complaints; he would like for VSOs and ROs to act as if they are on one team.

Accredited representatives pay specific attention to certain phases in the claim process, such as the rating and pre-decisional review letters.

* VFW noted that they do receive pre-decisional review letters so they can see the decision before it is sent to the Veteran. This gives them the opportunity to catch errors one more time.
* The Kentucky RO supervisor noted that VSOs check the status or rating in VBMS before the decision is promulgated and authorized. VSOs can identify errors prior to the final rating.

Two attorneys or claims agents from the survey also noted that they would appreciate more communication with the Regional Office, to also point out issues like missing end products (EPs) and mistakes.

**Recommendation:** Share these findings with the Employee Experience team or other relevant teams, as they are not within our immediate scope. Constructive communication between representatives and Regional Offices could be a significant means to reduce the time that Veterans receive benefits, especially if it prevents errors and further reviews.

An Indiana CVSO shared a specific idea, asking for a “Can you check this again” button instead of looking for the RO supervisor and sending them a message through Teams.

## CVSOs seek to optimize the signature workflow part of the claim filing process through third party tools they use (VetPro, TylerTech solutions).

*We discussed this topic with about two VSOs, one VFW supervisor and the Kentucky RO supervisor.*

The accredited representatives we spoke with used third party Tyler Tech tools Vetraspec and TVB and these tools had signature solutions. Similar to what we heard from prior research, they follow the organization’s rules for what they can and cannot sign for.

* VFW representatives can sign for anything other than the original claim and any form that removes benefits. So they can sign for the 21-686c.
* Kentucky CVSO asks Veterans to sign for the 21-22, 4138 (Statement in support of claim) and 0791 (PTSD) and the initial claim. Otherwise, they can sign for the Veteran.
* The Vetraspec and TVB solution stored the Veteran’s signature in the system so that the representative can use it to complete the form.

Even when representatives can sign for the Veteran, they still review the forms with the Veteran. However a Kentucky CVSO raised another nuance in the review phase. When they meet with the Veteran 1:1, they easily share their screen and walk through the form. If they speak over the phone, they can only read through the document; they are unable to send it to the Veteran due to security rules. He was not sure if these were federal rules or state rules, but this changed his review process.

**Recommendation:** We can still expect that a signature workflow solution would benefit representatives to easily complete their submissions, and we should think through what the review phase looks like between a representative and Veteran when using future auto-establishment to VBMS methods.

## SHARE provides unique information related to payment history.

*We discussed this topic with about four CVSOs.*

Some CVSOs accessed SHARE, others did not; we did not see a clear pattern around who could access it and who could not. When asked, one CVSO said it was a bit of mystery as to who had access.

CVSOs access SHARE to find 1) detailed payment history for the Veteran 2) current POA, even if they do not have POA for that Veteran.

SHARE shows all the payment history for any Veteran; if a Veteran comes into a VSO’s office and says they haven’t filed anything with the VA before, a representative can enter the Veteran’s Social Security Number and confirm whether or not any payments have been made. If payments were made, the CVSO could investigate if something was filed. They can also see specific payments for dependents and retroactive payments which are not shown in VBMS. They can explain why two checks were made to the Veteran instead of one.

As heard in earlier studies, a New Mexico CVSO who specializes in appeals checks SHARE to see which organization holds the POA. They may also call the Regional Office to see if the Veteran has an appeal, because accepting POA for a Veteran who has an appeal causes rework and frustration.

**Recommendation:** For our longer-term roadmap, we should consider whether or not we want to show payment history. Not all representatives needed this to support Veterans during the claims process, but it proved helpful to those who could access it. In her 2023 walkthrough of SEP, Melissa Rebstock noted that representatives appreciated the more specific payment view in SEP.

# Further questions

Attending the conference raised further questions that deserve some future exploration, a few of which are below.

* How do representatives review forms, digital and paper, with Veterans? Are their viewing constraints and why?
* What does your organization report? Who do they report to? How do they do this? Why?
* How do representatives support older Veterans who find it challenging to use va.gov and ID.me? This was one of the most responded to topics on the Whova the conference app, and VSOs have also raised this in prior research.
* How do representatives support Veterans who are very hard to reach (e.g. housing insecurity, no simple means of contact)?
