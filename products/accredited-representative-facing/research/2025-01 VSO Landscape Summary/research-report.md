# **Veterans Service Organization Landscape Summary**

01/2025

Prepared by Laura Paradis, Accredited Representative Facing Team

Reviewed by Eva Heintzelman, Accredited Representative Facing Team and Janelle Finnerty, Accredited Representative Management Team

**Purpose**

This summary provides a general view of the types of Veterans Service Organizations (VSO) that exist, to better inform the rollout of the Accredited Representative Portal to wider audiences. For all VSO accredited representatives to use this portal successfully, we do not want to rollout to VSO too large and complex too early; we also do not want to test only with the simplest type of VSO prior to a wide release.

This summary also sets context for different types of roles at VSOs, who may or may not be accredited representatives, and how they contribute to the overall process of supporting claimants of VA benefits.

**Key Findings**

* There are about 80 VSOs, with 23 of those being National VSO, 55 being State/Territory/Tribe.
* There are about 8,000 VSO representatives, with nearly 50% being cross-accredited with at least two VSOs.
* VSOs each have their own policy and procedures regarding claimant representation, and no clear standard exists across any one organization type, or any one role.
* VSOs can either follow a centralized or decentralized model for approving POA requests and submitting claims. VSO representatives either forward POA requests and claims submissions to a central office for review (centralized model), or they can accept/decline POA requests and/or submit claims on their own (decentralized model).

**Background**

This is a review of prior research and secondary research to provide the ARF team an overview of Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs).

Please note this summary was completed without access to Sharepoint or full Github access.

A list of organizations and representatives were downloaded from the Office of General Counsel’s (OGC) list of accredited representatives in November 2024. Other secondary research sources are listed in the appendix and linked throughout the document.

Notes on organizational data in spreadsheets:

* National Veteran Legal Services (NVLS) are omitted from any data analysis, because their attorneys held so many cross-accreditations which tended to skew the data.
* Organizations that were marked as not accepting requests were also removed from the analysis.
* Six organizations listed as having 0 accredited representatives were also excluded from analysis.
* The organization “Not accepting requests” was also removed from analysis.

**Research Goals**

Understand the landscape of VSOs and Accredited Representatives.

**Outcome**

Inform the ARF team of our primary user audience.

**Research questions**

* What does the landscape of VSOs look like at a high-level?
* What are primary types of VSOs in terms of structure?
* How do VSOs differentiate themselves in terms of services, delivery model, or other factors?

**Methodology**

Secondary research; analysis of existing data

## Research findings

This summary demonstrates the need to design for flexible workflows, organizational structures and roles. VSOs each have their own policy and procedures regarding Veteran claimant representation, and no clear standard exists across any one organization type, or any one role. Additionally, some VSO representatives are not aware of their organization’s (or organizations’, depending on the number of their cross-accreditations) rules.

### High-level view

Based on November 2024 data from OGC, there are about 80 VSOs with accredited representatives. The following chart shows a breakdown of VSO types according to National VSOs and State/Territory/Tribe VSOs and one Local VSO. More detailed descriptions of these types are below.

* National VSOs are organizations that serve Veterans nationwide. Many of these are member-based organizations like The American Legion (AL) or Disabled American Veterans (DAV). Some are non member-based organizations like the Dale K. Graham Veterans Foundation. The most influential national VSOs are referred to as “The Big 6,” and these include the following:
  + Disabled American Veterans
  + The American Legion
  + Veterans of Foreign Wars
  + Paralyzed Veterans of America
  + American Veterans
  + Vietnam Veterans of America
  + Wounded Warrior Project

Disabled American Veterans, The American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars are the top three VSOs in terms of submissions made through QuickSubmit in 2023, and The American Legion has the most accredited representatives of any VSO ([See ARM analytics research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representation-management/research/2023-12-ARM-analytics/research-findings.md)). These three VSOs are in general very active relative to other VSOs.

All “The Big 6” VSOs have branch offices across the United States; many — but not all other national VSOs (e.g., Fleet Reserve Association) have branch offices as well.

The National Association of County Veteran Service Officers’ (NACVSO) is a national VSO whose primary mission has a different focus from other national VSOs. NACVSO educates and trains County VSOs and Veteran advocates to help them with the claims submission process. Many individuals are accredited with NACVSO for this purpose. They also, however, directly serve Veterans as well, similar to how other national VSOs represent Veterans.

* Swords to Plowshares is the one local, non-state based organization that serves Veterans in the San Francisco Bay Area.
* State/Territory/Tribal VSOs are publicly funded and most often titled [State] Department of Veterans Affairs; or in the case of Texas, the Texas Veterans Commission.

State Veterans Affairs Departments identify who serves as a County VSO representative. In some cases, County VSO representatives are limited to only serving claimants in their county. County VSO representatives are often accredited with their state, and not all State VSO representatives are County VSO representatives.

States can have multiple locations where Veterans make appointments to get assistance filing an initial claim, and potentially get VSO representation. Texas has 47 locations where a Veteran could meet 1:1, with 10 of those locations providing initial claim service. These include locations at colleges, medical centers, and a county branch office.

There are four Territory VSOs; they include Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. These may operate similarly to State/County Veterans Affairs Department.

There are two Tribal Government VSOs from Gila River Indian Community Vet. & Fam. Svcs Office and Navajo National Veterans Administration. These also likely operate similarly to State Veterans Affairs Departments.

One reason the organization view is important is because claimants request POA by organization; each organization has their own POA while VSO representatives have their own unique registration number. Attorneys and claims agents each have their own three-digit letter/number POA code and registration number. Attorneys from NVLS for instance, can have two registration numbers if they are accredited as both an attorney and as a VSO representative.

***Follow-up questions***

* *What VSO classifications matter and why, when it comes to the design of this portal?*
* *What is the difference between local and state, or state and county, if any? Should there be different national classifications?*

### At the organization level

There are two primary types of organizational structures that would utilize the Accredited Representative Portal (ARP). In either structure, the view into information in VBMS may be partial, depending on whether the claimant gave authorization on VA Form 21-22 or 21-22a.[[1]](#footnote-0)

1. A centralized accept/decline model where an administrator approves POA requests before an accredited representative gains some level of access to the claimant’s information in VBMS.
2. A decentralized accept/decline model where the accredited representative accepts the POA request themself and then gains some level of access to the claimant’s information in VBMS.

Every VSO has a certifying official, and many VSOs have a manager of Veterans Service Officers. The below list is our interpretation of how VSOs can operate based on Accredited Representative Crew research and secondary research, not based on existing permissions in SEP. All below roles, other than the VSO representative, may or may not be VA accredited.

* **POA manager/administrator:** An individual who may be at a centralized office who reviews POA requests, accepts and assigns them to a VSO representative.
* **VSO representatives:** An individual who represents the claimant during the filing and adjudication of the claim. They call themselves Veterans Service Officers while we refer to them as VSO representatives.
* **Director/Manager/Supervisor of VSO representatives**: An individual who oversees VSO representatives and their work.
* **Certifying official:** OGC recognizes the certifying official as the individual at a VSO who manages accreditation and who updates VSO representative contact information.

The following diagram represents a centralized model like the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW). This large national VSO likely has this POA manager/administrative role, as well as several levels of Veterans Service Officers who may accept POA requests. VFW notes however, that only Associate Officers or higher may decline a POA request.

Note: This diagram is based on the VFW National Veterans Service Policy and Procedure document.

![Screenshot 2025-07-09 at 8 20 56 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cab593f-ab00-452e-a90b-724a0f266050)

The Wounded Warrior Project, a national VSO, also has local Post Service Officers who are volunteers, and they help Veterans and other claimants complete forms, while other Veterans Service Officers who are accredited formally sign-off on legal documents, e.g. Form 21-22. People who are responsible for activities related to legal representation may or may not be the same as those who support Veteran access to other local or community resources.

A state like Tennessee also follows this centralized model, but a state like New Mexico allows their accredited representatives to accept POA requests from New Mexico and other states ([See intercepts from NACVSO research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representative-facing/research/2024-05%20NACVSO/research-report.md#intercept-3--concept-and-preference-testing)). State VSOs are distinct from each other in how they operate; how distinct they are, and what distinctions matter is unclear.

Representation of a claim can take years, and so representatives typically do not work alone. In the case of VFW, a Claims Consultant may work with the Assistant Department Service Officer ([See ARM Secondary Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representation-management/research/2023-09-secondary-research/2023-09-secondary-research-accredited-representation-management.md)). Because the POA is accepted by the organization, both individuals have some level of access to the Veteran’s information, though a Director level VSO could have more permissions than a lower-level VSO representative.[[2]](#footnote-1)

The analysis for this research also did not make it clear as to which organization follows a distributed model, and which follows a centralized one and why. “It depends,” was a common finding across different research studies from the AR crew teams. How each VSO decides to operate varies from VSO to VSO. While larger national VSOs are likely to follow the centralized model, there is no set standard for a type of VSO. Each organization has their own policy and procedures to follow, and even with that, individual representatives may not be aware of them.

Though not all national VSOs are member-based, most of them are, and this is a key difference from state VSOs. A Veteran who is a member of e.g., DAV, who has existing relationships with DAV Service Officers, has good reason to appoint DAV as their power of attorney because of established trust. These member-based groups are often organized around affinities, e.g. being Navy-centered like the Fleet Reserve Association, or e.g. identifying with specific ethnicity and disability like the African American PTSD Association.

Overall however, Veterans experience difficulty when navigating this process of appointing a VSO; they are often not aware that they are appointing an organization, not an individual person. Veterans in general do not necessarily see the value in knowing this distinction. For more complicated claims, VSO representatives note that Veterans may seek more senior officers within one of the larger national VSOs like DAV or AL. ([See Appoint a Rep research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representation-management/research/2024-01-ARM-appointarep-usertest/research-findings.md)).

Other notable differences in VSO service delivery include the following:

* VFW established their Pre-Discharge program, where Pre-Discharge representatives guide military personnel through the VA claims process and assist with the preparation and submission of forms and evidence to VA prior to separation from active duty. This helps Veterans utilize VA’s Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program.
* Both state VSOs Illinois and Texas provide the option to select a female VSO, in their online request forms. Some Veterans did note this was important and would like to find same-gender representation if the claim is related to military sexual trauma (MST).

**Follow-up questions**

* *What are the organization types we should be considering? What nuances within the centralized and decentralized organization structure should we be aware of?*
* *What do we need to account for regarding state-level differences in how they provide claimant representation?*

###

### At the representative level

VSO representatives, claims agents and attorneys are the three types of accredited representatives who can accept POA requests and represent the claimant in their case for VA benefits. VSO representatives more commonly refer to themselves as Veteran Service Officers (VSOs); they can support Veterans in multiple ways beyond claimant representation ([See VSO representative persona](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1709236473099/7a69ce07dbe58af30f1954470bebbe59b7bf1160); [see Accredited Attorney persona](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1717533456497/60064424f651818203ff49ac43d6fb9f0f2bccac); [see Accredited Claims Agent persona](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1718731869465/cf73b89eddb92c604d292554a31e503f7ce5d982)).

Overall, there are about 7992 VSO representatives listed from the November 2024 download of OGC data, and 8050 when counting attorneys and legal assistants from NVLS.[[3]](#footnote-2) About 53% of VSO representatives have single-accreditation, about 47% are cross-accredited with 2 to 8 VSOs.

![Screenshot 2025-07-09 at 8 21 58 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f71199a-d279-4fe4-9e63-e52128b8b4e4)


Both National and State/County VSOs have single-accredited representatives. Single-accredited representatives are only legally able to represent claimants who file POAs with their organization; cross-accredited representatives can potentially accept POA requests across different organizations. VSO representatives, in general, state there are no differences in how they provide services based on single or multiple-accreditations.

![Screenshot 2025-07-09 at 8 22 37 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83fc7e87-0f2c-4544-a65a-33e9e54b6d92)


Representatives seek cross-accreditation to more quickly access Veterans files in VBMS; the more accreditations they have the more likely the Veteran will have POA with one of their organizations. Some State VSOs encourage their representatives to be cross-accredited for this reason ([See ARM cross accredited rep research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representation-management/research/2024-08-ARM-appointarep-crossaccreditedVSOR-usertest/research-findings.md#vsor-cross-accreditation)).

VSO representatives can hold positions across different types of organizations. A part-time County Veterans Service Officer (CVSO) could also be a part-time DAV Veterans Service Officer and/or part-time American Legion Veterans Service Officer for a 40-hour work week, a combination which may be more common in smaller counties.

Also, to reference VFW’s organizational structure, accredited representatives do not need to be Veterans Service Officers. Someone who is an accredited representative may play a central staff administrative role, who accepts POA requests to start the workflow for other Veterans Service Officers to represent claimants further.

![Screenshot 2025-07-09 at 8 23 15 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17d3cd08-e6b1-49b6-a2f9-30fbfc67441e)


For example, Douglas is a state accredited representative who has a cross-accreditation with VFW. He can accept a POA for this Veteran for his state of Illinois, but may not be able to accept a POA request for VFW though he can view it. In this case, Douglas would name the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs his primary VSO. Some VSO representatives, however, do not know their primary VSO, nor do they know why they would need to identify one as the primary. ([See ARM cross accredited rep research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representation-management/research/2024-08-ARM-appointarep-crossaccreditedVSOR-usertest/research-findings.md#vsor-cross-accreditation)).

The following chart shows the distribution of accredited representatives at organizations with the most accredited representatives. Many of these representatives could be double, triple, or even quadruple counted. Though American Legion’s count of representatives is the highest, this number could also be an anomaly.

![Screenshot 2025-07-09 at 8 23 43 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d178b7a-b92a-404a-94de-a52738ce2952)


When it comes to workloads, State/County VSOs appear to have the highest; one State/County VSO representative can have 5,000 - 10,000 claimants. While this observation is based on small sample sizes, it is one that persists across various studies. The backlog is long, and the need for efficiency is very high. For national VSOs, the workload per organization’s representative likely varies, with “the Big Six” handling the most volume of claimants.

About 40 attorneys and legal assistants at the NLVS are uniquely accredited, often across 29 or more VSOs, most of those being states. Because they often provide legal assistance nationwide, we assume their cross-accreditation enables access to a Veteran’s information to prepare their case.

*Follow-up questions*

* *Does having a primary VSO impact a representative’s workflow? Should it? How and why?*
* *Based on all the nuances of policies and cross accreditations, should we design to allow for people to set permission rules for their own orgs?*

### Next steps

We will conduct more specific research around permissions so that the new accredited representative portal will be designed for improved workflows for all types of VSOs and representatives.

1. VBMS will turn off the ability to see all medical records, even if claimant asks for specific medical records to be not shared. [↑](#footnote-ref-0)
2. Their level of access could also be dependent on government clearance status. [↑](#footnote-ref-1)
3. There are about 45 National Legal Veterans Services (NVLS) attorneys and legal assistants; about 43 of them are cross-accredited with 29 states. NVLS does not directly charge the Veteran for any services. NLVS works with states and some national NVSOs to offer legal services. [↑](#footnote-ref-2)
