# ARF Recruitment and Participant Management Strategy	

## Recruitment

The team will be using multiple channels for recruitment throughout user testing phases. 

1. **Intake form** - Using a [Google intake form](https://forms.gle/PFWA3qZVX1gYwphW7) ([link to edit the form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1COC4LzpflQdz4D5UNcNXUv_ej6vdg7LeYlilxoBLlqo/edit)) at the 1/23/24 listening session, we will be asking representatives to sign up to participate in feedback opportunities. At the end of testing sessions, we will share out the link to the intake form again for snowball sampling. Participant information is saved in [Sharepoint](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/vaabdvro/EeybP8j7NR9Mrs_k1ruBuf4BLmviCoq-HV-R7ZN29Nf3Cw?e=utFPTm) (file path: Accredited Representative Facing > POA 21-22 > 00 Participant Panel).
2. **VSO POC** - Martin Caraway, VSO Liaison, will assist with recruiting more specialized groups using his contact lists. 
3. **Attorney/Claims Agents POC** - The head of NOVA, a professional association for accredited attorneys and claims agents, attended the listening session on 1/23/24 and has volunteered to assist with recruitment across these two user groups. 
4. **Direct contact** - If needed, Lesley and ARF Design will cold-call VSOs, particularly state/regional/local, to ensure representation in studies. 
5. **Lighthouse contacts** - A UXR from the Lighthouse team who has done research with VSOs shared a spreadsheet of contacts. This is a last-resort in case specific users are needed, as we were not the team to first contact these individuals for research. If used, please contact the Lighthouse team to let them know we conducted research with any individuals on this spreadsheet, which is saved in Sharepoint.

## Participant management

All participant information is to be saved in Sharepoint and password protected, if possible. When conducting research, please make sure to indicate the most recent test date for a participant within the spreadsheet.

## Test sessions

Please use a [participant test tracker template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10VSiXTpz3QQ6G_xO5RXKE8oBu-4GO_RvxLSbSyWR-ik/edit?usp=sharing). This should be saved to Sharepoint at the start of a research study within the appropriate research folder, and participant information should **only** be added to it once in Sharepoint. 

At the end of test sessions, make sure the participant management spreadsheet in Sharepoint is updated to reflect the most recent test sessions. If using Lighthouse-recruited reps, contact the Lighthouse team as well.
