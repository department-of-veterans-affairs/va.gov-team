# SEP Audit Findings

## Audience

The public-facing website indicates it’s intended for **VSO representatives, attorneys, and claim agents**. But there are three exceptions, which appear to be portals or features within SEP that were never built/launched:

* **SEP Education Service** for schools and training institutions. 
* **Purchased Care @ Health Administration Center (PC@HAC)** for healthcare providers.
* **Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E)** for employers and people supporting Veteran employment.

The SEP portal in its current state is intended for VSO representatives, attorneys, and claims agents only.

## Authentication

Users can sign in using their PIV card or ID.me. 

* If they don’t have an account yet, they can **Register for a Sign-In Partner** which directs them to create an ID.me account.
* If they sign in with their PIV as a new user, they are prompted to input their OGC accreditation number. 

## Scope

Categories of tasks available in the SEP portal:

* Managing representation requests (accept/decline)
* Finding a Veteran
* Supporting claims
* Reviewing Intents to File
* Updating dependents
