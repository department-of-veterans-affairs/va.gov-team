## Timothy's background

* Worked with VBA from 2010-2019.
* In March 2019, Tim joined Wounded Warrior Project (WWP).
* Tim has just over 5 years experience as an accredited representative service officer, trains other representatives, and is an operation specialist with Wounded Warrior Project.
* Because Tim had 8-9 years experience with VBA, he knows the functionality in ways that other VSOs did not.
* Tim’s group trains folks from the ground up, TRIP certified, PIV card, TMS courses, etc. 
* Tim also directly supports Veterans. Average teammate supports 5-15 claims that they are actively monitoring and tracking through VBMS. The most he’s seen is 50-60 at once.
* Claims are filed through Quick Submit. 
* Tim’s whole team uses VBMS daily.
* Tim views his role as troubleshooting and advocacy. 
* Tim is only accredited with WWP.

## VBMS walkthrough 

* Tim says that he and his team access VA systems through an internet browser - specifically Chrome using Azure, Citrix, Citrix workspace, etc. 
* Likes accessing through "Windows authentication" (vs PIV?) saves 10 seconds
* When VBMS loads, it default loads in 1,500 claims that are coded to the POA code for WWP. There are actually more, but it loads 1,500. Tim would guess 30,000-50,000 claims done with WWP. 
* **Would love to see improvements: How we locate and bookmark an active claim.**
    * *“Bookmarking Veterans, their e-files and using the My Claims Queue.”*
    * *“This is a pain, I wish we could search a social [security number]. VSOs cannot bookmark from within the efile. We have to search every end product that has been opened for the Veteran. I have to find the open one, and bookmark it. It’s easy, but it’s time consuming.”*
    * *“I guarantee you every VSO out there, every service officer that works for VSO, would love the option right here, right now to just bookmark this open EP, or bookmark this Veteran. … If I could click bookmark and boom it was done, and then it was immediately in my claims queue that would be fantastic. But it doesn’t work that way.”*
* **Would love to see improvements: Would like to not have to search by first and last name.**
* Rebecca: How they sort in the “All claims queue” - Tim says there is no rhyme or reason.
    * It can be sorted, example: just rating decision completes, he could click that as a filter, and it would filter the listings. 
    * Useful if you are a director or regional manager or a higher up at any VSO, you can look at how many claims your organization has in certain statuses. 
* Rebecca: Can you see if other VSOs are cross accredited through VBMS? 
    * Yes.
* Rebecca: Can you see who is working on claims through VBMS? How do you see who is assigned to which claims? 
    * To his knowledge, not aware of anything related to assignments. Never seen that. *“Pretty well protected.”*
* WWP uses Salesforce, not VetPro or VetraSpec.
    * Salesforce is encrypted and safe for PII.
* WWP uses QuickSubmit or eFax mostly for submitting claims. 
* WWP encourages their “warriors” (VSOs) to apply or request representation with them through their eBenefits/VA.gov account.
* WWP uses SEP, daily. Does not want that function to go away. This is specific to approve/deny POA functionality.
* To check POA:
    * They come into VBMS.
    * Search by SSN.
    * The POA doc is available (viewable?) in the eFolder. 
    * Within 30-60 seconds of hitting submit in SEP, they can access the record in VBMS. If it doesn’t show up, it means an error or it hasn’t been processed yet.
    * For the most part, the process is under 5 minutes.
    * *“We use that dozens of times a day, every single day.”*
    * They receive POA inquiries from all over from Veterans they’ve never heard of.
* Rebecca: Do you ever use the Work Queue or My Veterans List function? 
    * Tim hasn’t heard of those.
* *“SEP is very user friendly for adding dependents, increasing claims and for disputing or disagreeing a claim.”*
* Rebecca: What do you receive? 
    * *“WWP is set up that all outgoing mail from VBA is carbon copied to a Veteran working with WWP. If we are POA when the letter goes out, it’ll have a cc: and WWP. This triggers VBA to mail the same thing to us as the Veteran.”*
    * Mail is received in the Houston TX office that distributes the mail to the warriors. They don’t really need or want paper mail, but it comes.
    * A letter mailed from VBA to a Veteran appears on VBMS.
* Unable to see anything related to education in VBMS. *“Major disadvantage to VSOs”*
    * *“You’re going to have to call education, you’re going to have to call DMC”* (Debt management center)
* Tim does not use “All filters” - he typically removes them to free up more screen space.
* **Would love to see improvements: Tim would love to have VBMS be able to generate a form and auto populate it.**
* **Would love to see improvements: They can see open reviews, but they cannot upload anything directly to VBMS. Cannot make edits, updates or modify.**
    * *“It is strictly like a book, we can only read it.”*
* Notes functionality on VBMS: 
    * *“Amazing for us”*
    * There is a note for every phone call Veterans make about their claims.
    * Can specifically view notes per claim.
    * Tim can view notes for just the end product, or every interaction that has happened.
        * Can see who left notes, so he can reach out to folks if needed. 
* Reaching out to folks at VA or VBA can be tricky - some are receptive to a collaborative approach, some are not. But having this ability to reach out to VBA personnel in real time is hugely helpful. 
* Tim offered to meet up again if the team has more questions.
