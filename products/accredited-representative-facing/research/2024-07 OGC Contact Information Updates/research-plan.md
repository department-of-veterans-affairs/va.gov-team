# Research Plan for Accredited Representative Facing Team, OGC Contact Information Updates, 07/2024<a id="research-plan-for-accredited-representative-facing-team-ogc-contact-information-updates-072024"></a>

## Background<a id="background"></a>

Veterans can search for and find accredited representatives on va.gov through the[ accredited representative directory](https://www.va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/find-rep/). Updating contact information for VSO Representatives in this directory is a cumbersome and manual process, with the VA’s Office of General Counsel (OGC) updating entries upon email request by the VSO certifying officials.[ See the current state map](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1717174574592/c341950387ab12e53dc358182f0c84774e94efb2?wid=0-1717174578256).

The Accredited Representative Facing team (ARF) is designing a future state that will allow VSO certifying officials to update contact information directly in the Accredited Representative Portal (ARP). This will reduce errors, speed up the process, and save OGC time.


### OCTO priorities<a id="octo-priorities"></a>

Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

- Key Result 2: Number of transactions processed during our products have increased by 25%.

- Key Result 3: All new products have a faster transaction time than those they replaced.

- Key Result 4: No transactions accepted by our products have a fatal error.

After years of focusing exclusively on Veterans who want to interact directly with VA, we will build tools for Veterans who want to work with accredited representatives, and the reps who support those Veterans. In doing so, we will redirect to VA.gov traffic currently going through[ eBenefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/homepage) and[ Stakeholder Enterprise Portal](https://www.sep.va.gov/sep/web/guest/sep) (SEP).

## Research Goals<a id="research-goals"></a>

### For Veterans Service Organization (VSO) Certifying Officials<a id="for-veterans-service-organization-vso-certifying-officials"></a>

| **Research goal**                                                         | **Research question**           |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Determine requirements for email address field(s).                        | What different email addresses do representatives have, and do they use different email addresses for different purposes? (e.g. VA vs. client communications) |
| Determine requirements for address field(s).                              | How many address fields do we need to provide, and what should distinguish one address from another?  |
| Determine permissions for VSO Representatives and certifying officials.   | Are certifying officials the only ones who can update a VSO Representative’s information?|
| Determine if public-facing VSO directories are a reliable source of truth | Are public-facing VSO directories accurate, and do they include location and phone number? |


### For accredited Attorneys and Claims Agents<a id="for-accredited-attorneys-and-claims-agents"></a>

| **Research goal**                                                         | **Research question**           |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Determine requirements for email address field(s). | What different email addresses do representatives have, and do they use different emails addresses for different purposes? (e.g. VA vs. client communications) |
| Determine requirements for address field(s).       | How many address fields do we need to provide, and what should distinguish one address from another?|


## Methodology<a id="methodology"></a>

**Semi-structured interviews /** The interviewer will ask the certifying official a series of questions to gather insight into their experiences, workflows, and policies. Questions will be customized depending upon the participant. 

**Concept testing /** The interviewer will show the certifying official some visual concepts of what updating contact information could look like in ARP. The agent, attorney or certifying official will be prompted for feedback around authentication, flow and navigation, content, and any interactive elements.
