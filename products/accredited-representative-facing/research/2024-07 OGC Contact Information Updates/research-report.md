## Background

Veterans currently search for and find accredited representatives on va.gov through the [Find a Representative page](https://www.va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/find-rep/). The contact information displayed has accuracy issues stemming from an outdated directory with a cumbersome process to update information. Updating contact information for VSO Representatives in this directory involves the VA’s Office of General Counsel (OGC) updating entries upon email request by the VSO certifying officials.

The Accredited Representative Facing team (ARF) is designing a future state that will allow VSO certifying officials and accredited representatives to update contact information directly in the Accredited Representative Portal (ARP). This will reduce errors, speed up the process, and save OGC time.

Our initial focus is on determining the requirements for email address, address, and permissions for VSO Representatives and Certifying Officials. 

### OCTO priorities

**Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.**

* **Key Result 2:** Number of transactions processed during our products have increased by 25%.
* **Key Result 3:** All new products have a faster transaction time than those they replaced.
* **Key Result 4**: No transactions accepted by our products have a fatal error.

After years of focusing exclusively on Veterans who want to interact directly with VA, we will build tools for Veterans who want to work with accredited representatives, and the reps who support those Veterans. In doing so, we will redirect to VA.gov traffic currently going through [eBenefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/homepage) and [Stakeholder Enterprise Portal](https://www.sep.va.gov/sep/web/guest/sep) (SEP).

Full list of [OCTO-DE priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202024.md).

### Veteran journey

Any/all points when a Veteran needs support filing and accessing their benefits.

## Research Goals 

* Determine the requirements of email address fields for both VSO Certifying Officials and Attorneys/Agents.
* Determine the requirements of address fields for both VSO Certifying Officials and Attorneys/Agents.
* Determine permissions for VSO Representatives and certifying officials.
* Determine if public-facing VSO directories are a reliable source of truth.

### Outcomes

* User interviews will inform adjustments to setting required fields, and/or adding additional fields for physical, mailing, and/or email addresses in the Accredited Representative Portal.
* Insights from user interviews will inform design decisions for a “self-service” experience where representatives can update their own information in the Accredited Representative Portal.
* Feedback from representatives about public-facing VSO directories will reveal pain points (if any) around data accuracy and/or insufficient information.

## Research Questions

We had two sets of research questions, one for Veterans Service Organization (VSO) certifying officials and one for attorneys and agents.

### For VSO certifying officials

1. What different email addresses do representatives have, and do they use different email addresses for different purposes? (e.g. VA vs. client communications)
2. How many address fields do we need to provide, and what should distinguish one address from another?
3. Are certifying officials the only ones who can update a VSO Representative’s information?
4. Are public-facing VSO directories accurate, and do they include location and phone number? 

### For attorneys and claims agents

1. What different email addresses do representatives have, and do they use different email addresses for different purposes? (e.g. VA vs. client communications)
2. How many address fields do we need to provide, and what should distinguish one address from another?

## Methodology

**Semi-structured interviews** / The interviewer will ask the certifying official, attorney, or agent a series of questions to gather insight into their experiences, workflows, and policies. Questions will be customized depending upon the participant. 

**Concept testing** / The interviewer will show the certifying official, attorney, or agent some visual concepts of what updating contact information could look like in ARP. The agent, attorney or certifying official will be prompted for feedback around authentication, flow and navigation, content, and any interactive elements.

### Interview Questions 

We asked two sets of questions to the participants. The discussion guide below covers the questions that were asked to both VSO Certifying Officials and attorneys/agents.

* [VSO Certifying Officials](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representative-facing/research/2024-07%20OGC%20Contact%20Information%20Updates/conversation-guide.md#vso-certifying-officials)
* [Accredited Attorneys and Claims Agents](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representative-facing/research/2024-07%20OGC%20Contact%20Information%20Updates/conversation-guide.md#accredited-attorneys-and-claims-agents)

## Key Findings 

1. **Representatives use existing accreditation search tools** but often encounter inaccurate data.
2. **VSOs have different practices** for updating contact information and the process is unclear to some.
3. Attorneys/agents find registration numbers useful but **they call it their “accreditation” number.**
4. Certifying officials want to **easily search for their representatives.**
5. **VA email addresses mislead Veterans** into thinking representatives work for VA. Some representatives use this email and some don’t.
6. Representatives **use multiple email addresses and want flexibility** as to which are publicly visible.
7. Representatives **use multiple addresses and want flexibility** as to which are publicly visible.
8. Representatives **don’t understand why a home address is required** and don’t want it publicly visible.
9. Representatives **use multiple phone numbers and want flexibility** as to which are publicly visible.
10. Representatives may have **other names they use** that they want to be publicly visible.
11. Representatives have **a variety of ways** they serve Veterans not currently reflected on VA.gov.
12. Representatives are **excited about the autonomy** that this tool provides.

## Details of Key Findings 

### Key Finding 1

**Representatives use existing accreditation search tools but often encounter inaccurate data.**

We asked representatives if they are familiar with [OGC accreditation search](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp) and/or “[Find a Representative](https://www.va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/find-rep/)” and what their experiences were like.

* Some representatives use the OGC accreditation search often to verify if someone is accredited and find accreditation numbers.
* They use Find a Representative less or not at all, and view it as a tool for Veterans, not representatives.
* They have encountered inaccurate data, including the wrong organizations listed and individuals who have passed away. 
* _Quote about inaccurate data_
    * _“I have been in Washington, DC for 13 years. If you put my name in there right now, under VSO Representative…They finally changed it. Up until about two months ago it said Boston, Massachusetts and I haven't been in the Boston area in 13 years.” - P4_
    * _“The tool (Find a Representative) may be good but if the data is wrong, then it is pointless.” - P4_

### Key Finding 2

**VSOs have different practices for updating contact information and the process is unclear to some.**

We asked participants to talk us through their current process of updating their contact information which revealed the unclear nature and the lack of process transparency.

* VSOs have different practices for updating contact information:
    * Some representatives are emailing OGC directly.
    * Some have support staff who work under the direction of the certifying official.
* _Quote about support staff permissions_
    * _“I travel a couple hundred days a year. When I get back to the office, there's a pile of paper accreditation forms on my desk. I review them, give them to my [executive assistant]. She does this part, not me. I don't have the time to do this. So yes, permissions would be important.” - P4_

### Key Finding 3

**Attorneys/agents find registration numbers useful but they call it their “accreditation” number.**

In the concept portion of our research, we collected feedback on updating contact information in ARP. We showed the dashboard and had participants talk us through their thoughts on the design and content. We went into detail about their thoughts on the “Your accreditation details” section and its contents.

* Attorneys and agents see value in the registration number and POA code, though some didn’t associate “registration number” with “accreditation number.” 
* _Quote about “registration number” versus “accreditation number”_
    * _“When I hear registration number, I think of my state bar number. So for attorneys, that could be confusing.” - P6_
    * _“Because everybody gets a POA code because its used on multiple documents when they're signing up Veterans, there's the POA code and the accreditation number. I don't know if that's the same here as the registration number. So you might wanna consider putting that accreditation number in too…” - P5_

### Key Finding 4

**Certifying officials want to easily search for their representatives.**

We showed certifying officials the [“Manage Your Representatives” ](https://www.figma.com/design/RbVQnV4eBl2K1Z5xRpZi7H/ARF---Contact-Info-Updating?node-id=325-207770&t=KsiMTuQDSyFE1eIG-1)page and asked them about their overall impressions, specifically the different search fields and information displayed.

* Certifying officials want to see all representatives but with the ability to see who is cross-accredited and filter to those singly accredited. 
* Certifying officials would search for representatives by name or county.
* _Quote on filtering search results_
    * _“The last time I checked, we had about 500 primary accredited and 1,500 cross-accredited representatives… Being able to filter our primary vs. cross accredited representatives is a needed function.” - P4_

### Key Finding 5

**VA email addresses mislead Veterans into thinking representatives work for VA. Some representatives use this email and some don’t.**

We asked participants if they used multiple email addresses and more specifically, how (if they do) use their VA.gov email address. 

VSO certifying official we spoke to: 

* Stated that VSO representatives use multiple email addresses and sometimes they don’t even check their VA.gov email.
* All representatives have at least two email addresses which are their VA.gov and business email addresses.
* Some organizations ask representatives to use their VA.gov email for communicating with Veterans, and some ask representatives not to use it. Representatives located in VA facilities are much more likely to use their VA.gov emails
* _Quotes about VA.gov email usage_
    * _“We've put out numerous times that if they are dealing with VA related claims work, they need to be using their VA.gov email address because it's secure and it's encrypted.” - P1_
    * _“Some use VA.gov emails more often since they're working from VA facilities where it's easier to get on the VA network.” - P1_

Agents and attorneys we spoke to:

* Agents and attorneys are less likely to use their VA.gov emails and attorneys will never use VA.gov to communicate with clients since it's confidential client information.
* Some representatives, especially attorneys and agents, don't like that their VA.gov emails make it seem as if they are VA employees.
* _Quotes about VA.gov email addresses_
    * _“I don’t work with VA, I'm not affiliated with them, and I don’t want my clients thinking I am affiliated with VA… I will never email a client with my VA email due to confidentiality concerns” - P7_
    * _“I don't check [VA email address] regularly. I will check it if I have an IT ticket pending, I will check it rarely. But I do not use it and because it does not come through my network, I'm not always logged into VA systems. I'm not always in the Citrix network, and I would never email a client from that due to confidentiality.” - P7_

### Key Finding 6

**Representatives use multiple email addresses and want flexibility as to which are publicly visible.**

Knowing that all representatives use multiple email addresses, we wanted to know what they use each email address primarily for.

* All representatives have multiple email addresses, though usually they have a primary one they use with Veterans.
* They desire clarity and flexibility over which email addresses to list publicly and which ones VA will use to communicate with them.
* _Quote about agents and attorneys using their VA.gov email address_
    * _“In my experience, it just feels like they (VA) take me more seriously if I'm emailing from VA.gov.” - P3_
    * _“That is the one thing I do use it for is if I've got an issue that I really need someone to pay attention to, then I will sometimes use my VA.gov email to email somebody at VA because I feel like sometimes that might just give me a little bit of extra chance of getting their attention. “ - P6_
* _Quote about attorneys using their professional email address to communicate with Veterans._
    * _“I think they're using their professional one (when talking to Veterans). I know when I was at Paralyzed Veterans, I had a VA.gov email address and I never used that to communicate with Veterans and instructed other people not to do that in my office because you know, you're representing a client and you have confidentiality with that client and you don't necessarily wanna be having those communications on a government email address.” - P5_

### Key Finding 7

**Representatives use multiple addresses and want flexibility as to which are publicly visible.**

* Many representatives have multiple addresses, though the mailing address for OGC is often different from the office location(s) for Veterans to visit. Some examples of different addresses include:
    * Main organization/business address
    * Local office
    * Other locations they work from
    * PO Box
* Most representatives expect that at least one address is required and will display publicly; this is clear for VSOs and less clear for attorneys and agents, especially those running small businesses from their homes.
* Some representatives provide services remotely and have no location for Veterans to visit, but this isn't clear in the current directory. 
    * Those working 100% remotely would either use headquarters or a PO Box as a mailing address only; some who run their own business from home may not want any address to display publicly.
* They desire clarity and flexibility over which addresses are listed publicly and which ones VA will mail to. 

### Key Finding 8

**Representatives don’t understand why a home address is required and don’t want it publicly visible.**

* Representatives were confused as to why their home address is required when all mail goes to their work address.
    * Some attorneys brought up that publishing their home address for public view is a privacy and safety concern. 
* _Quotes about publishing home addresses_
    * _“It gives me a panic attack if you are gonna put my home address out for the world to see.” - P3_
    * _“Something to keep in mind is we work with a fair number of psychiatrically disabled clients and cognitively impaired clients. And so I think it would be a concern anytime that someone's safety or their practice could be at risk…” - P7_
* _Quote about home addresses from a Veteran Service Organization representative_
    * _“I would be really curious to understand why there's a need for a home address. To me that is sort of a red flag for problems of things going to not the right address and something else to consider, about 30% of our members are Veterans themselves and therefore they work as an attorney representing Veterans, but they might also have their own claims and appeals on behalf of them or their family members. And I have had people say to me, they have gotten Veterans’ mail at their home address.” -P5_

### Key Finding 9

**Representatives use multiple phone numbers and want flexibility as to which are publicly visible.**

* For many law firms, there is a more general phone number where callers would reach a receptionist. Some attorneys preferred all of their inquiry calls go through a receptionist first. 
* Attorneys enjoy the ability to choose who they give out their direct lines to.
* _Quote about general versus direct lines_
    * _“Some people might want the VA to be able to contact them directly, but they may want a client to go through a receptionist.” - P7_
* Attorneys stated that many law firms still use a fax number and that they have worked with clients who use a fax machine as a primary way of sending documents.
* _Quote about Veterans using fax numbers_
    * _“We still have members who fax information to the VA. And I do think there's a lot of rural Veterans that don't necessarily have some of the same kinds of access. So yes, our members do have fax numbers.” - P5_

### Key Finding 10

**Representatives may have other names they use that they want to be publicly visible.**

* A complete name, including middle name, can be relevant to a representative’s identity and can help ensure Veterans are looking for the right representative. 
* Some representatives want to include previous names and preferred names to improve findability and inclusivity.
    * Some representatives changed their last names after they received accreditation and would want Veterans to have the ability to search them up by prior last names for findability.
    * Some representatives, such as representatives with foreign language legal names have a preferred name that they use.
* _Quote about prior names used_
    * _“Commonly for women with married names or non-married names. Yeah. I was already a licensed attorney when I got married, so maybe that would be helpful.” - P7_

### Key Finding 11

**Representatives have a variety of ways they serve Veterans not currently reflected on VA.gov.**

* We learned about some of the varieties of ways that representatives serve Veterans, and how some of this is not reflected well with current structures on VA.gov. Some representatives, for example, work fully remote and have a mailing address only; their physical location isn’t necessarily relevant to the Veterans they serve.
* These capacities are not reflected on VA.gov and limit Veterans from finding a representative that would best suit their needs.
* _Quote about working remotely but still using a business address for mail_
    * _“ I do remote work because I have Veterans all over the world. Really. I have out of country Veterans, I have Veterans in every state, including Hawaii.” - P2_
    * _“I do still have a physical address because I receive mail and people sometimes wanna mail their medical record. So I have a business address, but I'm not there” - P2_

### Key Finding 12

**Representatives are excited about the autonomy that this tool provides.**

* Representatives are looking forward to the ability to change their own contact information. Many have voiced concerns about the time consuming nature of their current process to update their contact information and believe that directly updating their own information on ARP will reduce time and inaccuracies. 
* Confirmation is crucial for representatives so they know that information has been updated successfully and accurately.
* _Quote about the benefits of autonomy_
    * _“It's great whenever we can self-serve and update our information and not have to rely on VA staff who are already over tasked and overworked and, then really puts the responsibility on us and if there's any errors we are only to blame if something was entered incorrectly. And I think for that is great. Having the ability to do stuff without depending on somebody else. Priceless.” - P2_
* _Quote about confidence in accurate information updates_
    * _“I'm assuming that there would be some prompt back to them when they completed it that would say your information has been successfully submitted because our members, the process of changing their address has been not good. Mailing has been not good and people feel very cynical, a little bit gun shy. So I think anything that would say, okay, you have successfully done this, they would walk away and say okay, now I know that, you know, as soon as this catches up, let's say a week or two, I'm now gonna reliably get everything. I mean I've had people tell me I'm getting old, I'm getting mail sent to old addresses five years later. So this looks like a vast improvement on any of that.” -P5_

## Recommendations

1. **Communicate with representatives if/when the OGC accreditation search is sunset, and have a redirect strategy.**
    1. Based on our interviews, most representatives use the OGC accreditation search regularly to find out if someone is accredited or to find accreditation numbers. Some use it on a daily basis. If representatives are not included in communications around sunsetting the OGC accreditation search, their workflow will be highly impacted.
    2. Representatives need to be considered as primary users of Find a Representative and include them in future feedback opportunities as we transition to using Find a Representative.
2. **Continue to prioritize workflows that empower representatives to keep their information updated.**
    1. As we know, dealing with inaccurate data has been mentioned in almost all of our interviews. By creating improved systems and workflows, we want to empower representatives to keep their information up to date so that inaccurate data becomes less of an issue.
3. **Before ARP goes live, ensure the permissions reflect both OGC policies and VSO practices.**
    1. VSOs have different practices for updating their contact information. We heard that some representatives - not always their certifying official - are emailing OGC directly to make updates. 
        1. Representatives aren’t clear about the current process, and recent research from the Accredited Representation Management team shows that some VSO representatives don’t know who their certifying official is. 
    2. Some VSOs have support staff that work under the direction of the certifying official. 
        1. We want to ensure that the permissions for certifying officials, their designees, and representatives on the ground reflect both OGC policies and VSO practices. 
4. **In the “My Dashboard”, change the “registration number” label to “accreditation number”.**
    1. Registration number is not a commonly used term and caused confusion for attorneys and agents in our interviews. 
    2. Participants informed us that “accreditation number” is a more commonly used and understood term.
5. **Allow certifying officials to see all representatives but allow them to filter to those who are singly accredited in the “Manage Representatives” screen.**
    1. For this recommendation, we also recommend future research with more certifying officials to get a more accurate representation with a larger sample size. But of the certifying officials we talked to, they expressed that it would be useful to see all representatives, both those who hold primary accreditation with their organization and those who are cross-accredited and hold secondary accreditation with their organization. 
6. **Display VA email addresses automatically in the user's private profile as a non-editable field.**
   1. We know that VA email addresses can mislead Veterans into thinking representatives work for the VA when they don’t, and this is something we’ve heard both from stakeholders and from Veterans directly. We learned that some representatives use their VA email and are actually instructed to use it because it’s secure; this is most common for those representatives who work at VA facilities and are regularly on the VA network. For others though, especially attorneys and agents, they explicitly do not use their VA email addresses due to client confidentiality.
    2. We’d like to display a representative’s VA email address automatically in their private profile as a non-editable field (to avoid any errors in typing their email addresses manually). It would be hidden from public view by default with the option to make it visible for those who really use it. 
7. **Require one primary email for OGC communications and allow users to select up to three email addresses to display publicly.**
    1. All representatives have multiple email addresses because they all have their VA.gov email and one through their organization, but they do tend to have one primary one they use with Veterans. They want more clarity and flexibility over which of these addresses are displayed publicly to Veterans and which ones VA will use to communicate with them.
    2. As mentioned in Recommendation 6, we’d automatically include their VA.gov email in their private profile which they could choose to make public or not. And we’d allow one additional alternate email field, resulting in three possible email addresses of which they can choose which one to display publicly, but having at least one of them public would be helpful for Veterans to communicate with them. 
8. **Allow users to select up to two addresses to display publicly while requiring one primary address for OGC communications and providing one additional optional address field.**
    1. We learned that similar to emails, representatives also often have multiple addresses, and that the mailing address for OGC is often different from the office locations that Veterans might want to visit. Similar to emails, they want clarity and flexibility around what’s listed publicly and which one VA will use for mailing. 
    2. We also recommend we come up with a system of labeling the addresses to make it clear if the address is their headquarters, their office location, or a mailing address. 
9. **Make the default setting for home addresses as “hidden from public.”**
    1. Representatives were concerned about their home addresses being visible to the public. By making it hidden, home addresses can still be a part of a representative’s profile without being visible to the public.
10. **Require one primary phone number to be visible publicly while allowing users to input up to two phone numbers with the ability to elect which ones are displayed publicly.**
    1. Representatives often have multiple phone numbers and they don’t want all of them visible publicly. And different numbers are used for different cases, for example, some representatives give their direct line to the VA but want new clients to go through the office hotline.
11. **Add a field for fax number.**
    1. Attorneys and agents still use fax numbers. Some stated that many of the Veterans they serve in rural areas will still contact them via fax and they would like to display their fax number for veteran accessibility. 
12. **Expand capacity in the “names” section and allow users to add a preferred name and any previous names used.**
    1. We learned that complete names, including middle names, can be relevant to a representative’s identity especially when searching for representatives.
    2. Previous names also allow for inclusivity and findability.
    3. Add a middle name and suffix field to align with 21a.
        1. Form 21a has fields for middle name and suffix, so we also recommend adding those as fields in someone’s profile for consistency. 
13. **Allow users to indicate how services are offered: “Fully remote,” “In person,” or “Hybrid”.**
    1. We learned about some of the varieties of ways that representatives serve Veterans, and how some of this is not reflected well with current structures on VA.gov.
    2. This would provide clear context to Veterans and how they choose to contact the representative.
14. **Provide representatives with confirmation messaging when information is updated. For example, providing a preview of what their profile will look like on VA.gov.**
    1. Representatives shared that they are not confident in the current process and that they are not getting any form of confirmation telling them that their information has been updated successfully. From this insight, we recommend that we should provide reps with some form of confirmation messaging when their info is updated. Also, we want to provide a preview of what their profile will look like on VA.gov to ensure that all the changes are correct.

## Next Steps

1. Update designs to reflect research findings and recommendations.
2. Create a usability test plan for the updated prototype.

## Further Research Needed

1. **Recruit and conduct further research on certifying officials.**
    1. In this round of research, we were only able to speak with a few certifying officials. By interviewing more certifying officials, we can get a better idea of their pains and needs to develop a substantial user persona.
    2. We still have not spoken to any Tribal certifying officials.
2. **Explore how certifying officials search for representatives and test current search fields and filters.**
    1. The certifying officials we spoke to mentioned organizing representatives by county. Future research can discover which fields and filters are useful for searching for representatives.
3. **Explore further ways to provide autonomy to representatives which will reduce manual processes facilitated by OGC.**
    1. It is clear from our research that representatives enjoyed the autonomy that ARP could provide. 
    2. We are only scratching the surface and further research with more certifying officials, attorneys, and agents can identify any room for growth.
4. **Conduct research on cultural nuances.**
    1. In our research, we discovered that representatives may use different names and sometimes have a preferred name. This can be because they have names in different languages.
        1. Some languages do not use a “middle name” so this label may not be inclusive.
    2. Exploring if and how this affects their public profile will promote inclusivity and accessibility.
5. **Explore how the updating contact information workflow can intersect with other workflows such as Form 21-22 and Form 21a.**
