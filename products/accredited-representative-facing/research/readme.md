## Recruitment and Participant Management 
Participant recruitment was previously done through a [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1COC4LzpflQdz4D5UNcNXUv_ej6vdg7LeYlilxoBLlqo/edit). That form has since been migrated to a [Microsoft form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=Ixtf6a-r7kWCHberJRqzv4cLYkW9qpVNsB4hyfWvYHZUQlNJUjkwQjRJQlZVVURXNTdVMjJRN1hQVC4u&route=shorturl) (Sharepoint; file path Accredited Representative Facing > POA 21-22 > 00 Participant Panel). Lesley and Janelle from the ARM team manage this form.
