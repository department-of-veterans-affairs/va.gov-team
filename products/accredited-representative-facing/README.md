# Accredited Representative Facing (ARF)

## About ARF

The Accredited Representative Facing (ARF) team, part of the Accredited Reps Crew within the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) Benefits Portfolio at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), supports Accredited Representatives in their work with Veterans.

See the [VA Organigram](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1678236223248/ef60b22feff4aa22c594256683b81988abc1f181?invited=true&sender=u44da4f823ec94118a7079396) for a visual on where ARF sits within this organization.

## Mission

Our mission is to create an accessible, modern, and secure online system for Accredited Representatives. We aim to streamline the use of digital forms, providing a faster and smoother experience for both representatives and the Veterans they serve, ultimately improving the overall VA experience.

## Primary Work Flows

### Form 21a digitization (representative accreditation)
Before attorneys or claims agents can help Veterans with claims, they need to become accredited through VA. To become accredited, they need to submit Form 21a, which the Office of General Counsel (OGC) uses to verify the applicant’s credentials and reputation. Claims agents then need to complete a written test verifying they have sufficient knowledge of the claims process.

This form is currently a paper form. OGC would like to cut down on the time needed to process the form by digitizing it. ARF began this process and documented next steps and relevant resources on the [21a Digital Accreditation page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representative-facing/21a-digital-accreditation.md).
