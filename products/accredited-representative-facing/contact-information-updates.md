# Contact information updates

## Problem overview

Veterans and others can access information about accredited representatives (i.e. VSOs, attorneys, claims agents) on the [Find a Rep tool](https://www.va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/find-rep/) and the [OGC Accreditation Search](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp). The information on these tools is often out of date. Updating contact information is a highly manual process managed by the Office of General Counsel (OGC). We aim to design something that is more efficient for both representatives and OGC, leading to more reliable information for Veterans. This will be one feature in the **Accredited Representative Portal (ARP)**, which is envisioned to be a one-stop-shop for accredited representatives to get accredited and support Veterans and their dependents with their claims. 

**For more information on this product, view the [contact information updates product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representative-facing/product-info/contact-information-updates-product-outline.md).**

## The end user

Accredited attorneys and claim agents can update their contact information by contacting OGC (verify). However, VSO reps are told to contact their certifying official, who will request an information update for them. Because VSO reps can't update their information directly, we aren't currently including them as direct users of this feature. We have personas for attorneys and claim agents, but don't yet have one for certifying officials.

## Understanding the problem and opportunity 
* [Process for Accredited Attorney and Claims Agent Contact Change Requests](https://www.va.gov/OGC/docs/Accred/FactSheet_OBI-21-03.pdf) (factsheet on VA.gov) - Attorneys and claim agents need to email 2 separate addresses to update their data in 2 separate databases.
* [Notes from meetings with OGC](https://dsva.slack.com/docs/T03FECE8V/F078CNNHQU9) (Slack Canvas in the OCTO/DSVA workspace; ask Jen or Lesley for access) - Meetings from regular discovery meetings ARF had with OGC in June and July 2024. These meetings helped us understand the problem and policies related to updating representative’s contact information.
* [Current and future state (Mural)](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1717174574592/c341950387ab12e53dc358182f0c84774e94efb2?sender=u8cf3f08a008c2b61ad621433) - These service blueprints were created by ARF in collaboration with subject matter experts from OGC. The current state has been validated, and as of August 2024 the future state is still a work in progress as we work more with OGC, conduct more research with VSO, certifying officials, and agents, and consider scope and technical feasibility.
* [Contact updating flows](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1720800350435/11ddeed005714571717010aa00c2bdb6def343ac?sender=u8cf3f08a008c2b61ad621433) (Mural) - Rough flows of what we imagine designing and building to allow representatives to update their contact information. These were based on the future state map and used as a starting point to create mockups in Figma.
* [Accredited Representative contact info updates](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1717433860326/129030147cf419fe9f5deb7004c0fb0a1a4e2350?sender=u2a4240a640b257ce33545495) (Mural) - A simple flow showing how we envision data moving from the portal to GCLAWS and CorpDB.
* [OGC Accreditation Search](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/) (tool on va.gov) - The public-facing OGC database that allows anyone to search for an accredited representative. We know from research that this is often used to confirm (or deny) if someone is currently accredited. GCLAWS is the backend.
* [Find a Representative](https://www.va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/find-rep/) (tool on va.gov) - This went live in the summer of 2024 and is intended to replace the OGC Accreditation Search above as a more modern and Veteran-facing tool. The Accredited Representation Management (ARM) team designed and launched this tool, and discovered in the process that much of the data is outdated or inaccurate. Their discovery is part of what led to the Contact Information Updates project becoming a priority.

## Proposed next steps
* Interview more certifying officials to develop a persona for this user type. See the [Future Research Activities Mural board](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1718980793805/b1c89e3110a00b235ee30bc04bab3cc96a33c696?sender=u2a4240a640b257ce33545495) for more information on proposed research studies about 21a and other ARP features.
* Run a usabilty test to validate if the changes we made since the last set of user research work well for our intented audience.
* Work with development to build these features. (To date, no development work has been done on content updates specifically, outside of general infrastructure for the Accredited Representative Portal). **<- True?**
* As we get closer to launch, explore ways that we can meld the IA/header and footer for this feature (contact info updates) with the other features our team explored (Forms 21a and 21-22). The IA that gets selected for the initial ARP release will be entirely dependent on which feature(s) go live first. These features have been designed independently so far, but if two features go live at the same time, the team will need to explore how it should be presented.
