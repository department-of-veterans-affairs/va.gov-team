# MVP - Accredited Representative Facing

## Objectives

- Develop a user-friendly website that enables Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) to manage power of attorney (POA) requests from veterans efficiently.
- Ensure the site's design accommodates future expansions for additional tasks accredited representatives perform.

## User Stories

- **As a VSOrg:** I need to be able to accept or reject a Veteran’s request for power of attorney (21-22) so that I can quickly get to work on the Veteran’s claims.
- **As a National VSOrg:** I need administrative control over who can manage POA requests within my organization to prevent bottlenecks in assisting Veterans.
- **As a VSOfficer with ability to accept or deny:** I need to be notified when I have a POA request pending for my review so that I’m not delayed in starting my work.
- **As a VSOfficer:** I require a secure login system to verify my accreditation and identity in order to protect Veterans’ Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI).
- **As a VSOfficer:** I need immediate access to the Veteran’s records once I’ve accepted their POA so that I can immediately start working on the Veteran’s claim.
- **As a Veteran who is a VSOfficer:** I need to be confident that I’m affecting only the Veteran’s files and not my own so that I can have confidence using the system.


## MVP but may be with another team
- **As a Veteran:**  I need to be notified whether my POA request was accepted or rejected in order to know if I need to seek further assistance.

## Non-functional requirements

- Accessibility: The site must be easily accessible to users with diverse abilities, including being 508 compliant.
- Flexibility: The site's architecture should support adding various features in the future.
- Mobile Friendliness: The site must be designed to be mobile-friendly, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices.

## Additional Research Work

- Investigate other challenges and pain points experienced by accredited representatives that could be addressed through an enhanced website/system.
