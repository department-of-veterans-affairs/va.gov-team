## Overview
*After you've explored the problem and through testing / hypothesis have identified the ideal solution, write up one sentence describing the solution you'll be creating.*

## Problem Statement

As the OGC database has grown over the years, Currently when a request from an attorney, claims agent, accredited representative, or a certifying official submits a request to update contact information in the OGC database, these request enter a manual workflow that requires an OGC staff member to review and route this request in order for the update to the database to take place.
Additionally, it can take up to an additonal 72 hours to be reflected in the OGC database. This process is time consuming for both the submitting party and for OGC staff, as over _______ number of these requests are submited per (day/year)

How might we simplify the process for a claims agent, attorney, VSO representative, or certifying official to request that their contact information be updated in OGC?
How might we reduce the amount of time it takes for OGC staff to process any contact information requets that require verification?
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Reduce the amount of time and manual steps that an OGC staff member spends on an incoming contact information update request.
- Reduce the amount of time it takes for an approved contact information update request to be reflected in the OGC database.
- Provide a more consistent experience for veterans as they search for and reach out to their attorney/claims agent/VSO representative.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Increasing the amount of time it takes an OGC staff member to support a process for updating contact information in the OGC database. 
-  

## Desired Business Outcomes

- This would free up the amount of time OGC staff needs to spend manually supporting requests for contact information updates, and free them up to 
- With more accurate OGC contact information, all products that utilize this contact information will benefit from having more accurate data available, and will result in a more consistent experience for both veterans and their supporting attorneys/claims agents/VSO representatives.
