# Product Outline Accredited Rep Facing

---

## Overview
We will create a site for accredited representatives hosted on va.gov yet visually distinct where VSOs are able to accept or reject representation requests from form 2122.
Objectives:
Develop a user-friendly website that enables Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) to manage power of attorney (POA) requests from veterans efficiently.
Ensure the site's design accommodates future expansions for additional tasks accredited representatives perform


## Problem Statement
The current systems for accepting or denying representation requests by form 2122 are either hosted on a deprecated site (SEP), or are entirely on paper. It is very slow and doesn't contain a method for notifying the Veteran if the request has been accepted or rejected.

How might we digitize the acceptance of form 2122 and host it on a more modern site. This is a complimennt to the ARM team's work.

## Desired User Outcomes
A Veteran Service Organization is able to accept or reject a Veteran’s request for power of attorney (21-22) 
A National Veteran Service Organization has administrative control over who can manage POA requests within their organization
A Veteran Service Officer with ability to accept or deny is notified when a  POA request is pending for my review 
A Veteran Service Officer has a secure login system to verify accreditation and identity 
A Veteran who is a Veteran Service Officer can be confident that they are affecting only the Veteran’s files and not their own
A Veteran is notified whether their POA request was accepted or rejected 
The site increases the number of claims accepted or rejected digitally
Representatives begin to use and trust the site
Representives are able to immediately start working on a Veteran's needs as soon as they accept the representation request.

## Undesired User Outcomes
Representatives find the site too confusing or ineffiencent
Representatives continue to use paper/manual forms

## Desired Business Outcomes
Increased use of digital forms which is a current OCTO priority
Decrease in forms that are unanswered or unresponded to

## Undesired Business Outcomes
Representatives are unwilling to use the site, even as it expands into other uses
