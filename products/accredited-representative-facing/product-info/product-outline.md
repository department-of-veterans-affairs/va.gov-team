# Product Outline Accredited Rep Facing

---

## Overview
We will create a site for accredited representatives hosted on va.gov yet visually distinct where VSOs are able to accept or reject representation requests from form 2122.

Objectives:
Develop a user-friendly website that enables Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) to manage power of attorney (POA) requests from veterans efficiently.
Ensure the site's design accommodates future expansions for additional tasks accredited representatives perform


## Problem Statement
The current systems for accepting or denying representation requests by form 2122 are either hosted on a deprecated site (SEP) or are entirely on paper. It is very slow and doesn't contain a method for notifying the Veteran if the request has been accepted or rejected.

How might we digitize the acceptance of form 2122 and host it on a more modern site. This is a complement to the ARM team's work.

## Desired User Outcomes
 - A Veteran Service Organization is able to accept or reject a Veteran’s request for power of attorney (21-22) 
 - A National Veteran Service Organization has administrative control over who can manage POA requests within their organization
 - A Veteran Service Officer with the ability to accept or deny is notified when a  POA request is pending for my review 
 - A Veteran Service Officer has a secure login system to verify accreditation and identity 
 - A Veteran who is a Veteran Service Officer can be confident that they are affecting only the Veteran’s files and not their own
 - A Veteran is notified whether their POA request was accepted or rejected 
  - The site increases the number of claims accepted or rejected digitally
 - Representatives begin to use and trust the site
 - Representatives are able to immediately start working on a Veteran's needs as soon as they accept the representation request.


## Desired Business Outcomes
 - Increased use of digital forms which is a current OCTO priority
 - Decrease in forms that are unanswered or unresponded to

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
 - Increased use of digital acceptance of forms
 - Positive customer feedback
 - Decrease in time between when a VSO accepts a 2122 and when the rep can access a Veteran's records



### Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)
- The majority of representatives report an easy experience with the process of using the site
- The time between acceptance of representation and access to the Veteran's record is shortened

## Assumptions
- VSOs want to be able to digitally accept or reject 2122
- Representatives want an online digital representative portal
- Representatives are unhappy with the current approach
- representatives who are Veterans are concerned that the site not be confused with the Veteran facing va.gov

## Solution Approach
- Create a flexible site built on va.gov that can be expanded to allow other rep facing tasks
- create a visually distinctive site that still conforms to VA.gov look and feel
- Create a site that allows VSOs to accept or reject 2122

### Initiatives
Parallel effort to conduct research with accredited representatives to further explore what a representative site could be used for and prioritize those needs.

## Launch Strategy
- We will collaborate with Office of General Counsel and VBA VSO liaison (Marty Calloway) in addition to the Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs to make VSO aware of the new site and encourage adoption.

## Launch Dates
Target Launch Date
  - Late June/early July staying aware of possible code freezes.
