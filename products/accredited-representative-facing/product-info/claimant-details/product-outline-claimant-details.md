# Product Outline - Claimant Details

**Team**: Accredited Representative Crew\
\
**Entry Point**: [va.gov/representative/find-claimant](http://va.gov/representative/find-claimant) (not yet in Production)


## Overview

In FY 2023, 78% of Veteran benefits claims were filed with an accredited representative on file. The VA is required to provide these accredited representatives and organizations with access to necessary claimant information, to facilitate their representation efforts and ensure proper notification regarding claims. This regulatory framework aims to support Veterans in obtaining the benefits and services they are entitled to, by ensuring they have knowledgeable and authorized representation.


## Problem statement

In order to successfully manage the full cycle of the claims submission process, accredited representatives need to be able to search for Veterans and other claims they represent and view basic details about the Veteran's representation and claims submission status.


## Desired User Outcomes

1. After locating a claimant in Find Claimant search results, a representative user can view additional details about this claimant.

2. Users can see the following information about a claimant they represent:

   1. Claimant Overview

      1. Claimant Information: Date of Birth, VA file number, Address, Phone, Email
      2. Current representation: Representative, VBMS eFolder access, Type of representation, Change of address authorization
      3. ITF information: Type, creation date, expiration date

   2. Submission History

3. When claimants have a pending representation request, users are presented with a call to action to review the pending request.

4. For claimants that users don't hold representation for, users will be presented with an alert "You don't represent this claimant" and declinations of representation requests from the past 60 days are displayed below.


## Undesired User Outcomes

1. Users can see claimant details for claimants that they do not represent.


## Desired Business Outcomes

1. Provide accredited representatives with access to necessary claimant information, to facilitate their representation efforts and ensure proper notification regarding claims.
