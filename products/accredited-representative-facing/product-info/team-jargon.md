## Project-Specific Terms
  
- **accredited representative:** Professionals who are certified with VA to assist Veterans in navigating and obtaining their entitled benefits and services. There are three types of accredited representatives: VSO representatives (see below), claims agents, and attorneys. Read more about these types on the [Accredited Representatives](https://www.benefits.va.gov/vso/) page or [Find a VA accredited representative or VSO](https://www.va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/find-rep/) page. Note that "accredited representative" uses lower case capitalization.

- **ARM (Accredited Representative Management):** Our sister team, who works on products for Veterans that also impact accredited representatives.
- **certifying official:** Individuals that are reponsible for the accreditation of VSO representatives at their organization. They approve and cancel accreditation and also keep representatives' contact information up to date.

  - Previously, "VSO" could refer to both "Veterans Service Organization" or "Veterans Service Officer"—an individual who works at the organization. These individuals are now called "VSO representatives." Veterans still sometimes refer to these individuals as VSOs.
- **VSO representative:** Individuals who are certified and formally associated with (and sometimes employed by) a Veterans Service Organization. They are one of three types of accredited representative. Note that "representative" uses lower case capitalization. Internally, we shorten this phrase to "VSOR."
