## Overview
*Veterans often encounter barriers when attempting to correct personal information (e.g., name, gender, service dates) due to fragmented data ownership between the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DoD). This repository outlines the work to improve the Veteran and staff experience by clarifying data ownership, documenting update workflows, and providing standardized communication and escalation tools.*

## Problem Statement
*Veterans face inconsistent and unclear experiences when trying to correct personal data (name, gender, service dates, etc.) due to split data ownership between VA and DoD. The current lack of clarity on:
- Who owns the data (VA or DoD)
- Where the data resides
- How Veterans or VA staff should initiate updates or escalations results in delays, frustration, and unresolved issues. Both Veterans and VA staff need a reliable system of processes, communication materials, and escalation pathways.(https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/problem-framing)*


## Desired User Outcomes

- We believe that by documenting data ownership rules, defining update execution workflows, and providing standardized veteran communication and staff escalation templates, we will improve the clarity, speed, and consistency of resolving veteran data correction requests, resulting in reduced veteran frustration, fewer misdirected inquiries, and faster resolution times, as measured by decreased complaint volumes, increased first-contact resolution rates, and improved staff confidence in handling data update issues.

## Undesired User Outcomes


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Veterans Feel Informed and Empowered
Veterans clearly understand which entity (VA or DoD) owns their data and how to initiate corrections confidently.

- Consistent and Efficient Staff Responses
VA staff consistently provide accurate, timely, and complete guidance using standardized workflows and templates.

- Reduced Veteran Frustration and Rework
Fewer misdirected or unresolved inquiries, leading to reduced complaint volumes and improved satisfaction.

 -Improved Resolution Times
Faster issue resolution through clear ownership identification and direct escalation pathways.

- Operational Readiness Across Teams
All relevant VA teams are fully trained and equipped with updated tools, templates, and documentation.

- Data Integrity Across VA and DoD Systems
Fewer data inconsistencies through proactive corrections and validated update processes.

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Continued Veteran Confusion
Veterans remain unsure of who owns their data or how to correct it, resulting in frustration and mistrust.
- Inconsistent Staff Guidance
VA staff provide conflicting, incomplete, or inaccurate instructions, leading to escalations and rework.
- Unresolved or Delayed Data Corrections
Issues are stalled or misrouted, increasing resolution times and harming Veteran experience.
- Staff Reliance on Workarounds
Teams bypass the standardized process, leading to inconsistent outcomes and loss of accountability.
- Increased Complaints or Escalations
Veterans escalate issues to leadership, the White House hotline, or external advocacy groups due to poor experiences.
- Breakdown in VA-DoD Collaboration
Failure to validate ownership rules or establish effective workflows results in operational friction and delays.
