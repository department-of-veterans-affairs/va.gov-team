# Product Outline - Intent to File 

**Team**: Accredited Representative Crew\
\
**Entry Point**: [va.gov/representative/submissions](http://va.gov/representative/submissions) (not yet in Production)


## Overview

Intent to File (ITF), VA Form 21-0966, enables claimants (Veterans and dependents) to officially express their intention to apply for VA benefits and establish a potential start date for their benefit payments, maximizing their opportunity for back pay. After submitting the ITF, claimants typically have up to one year to gather evidence and submit a complete application for benefits.\
\
Claimants can submit an ITF themselves online, by mail, or in person at a VA regional office. And submitting ITF on behalf of claimants is a common next step for accredited representatives, after establishing POA.\
\
There are three types of ITF:

1. Disability compensation (Veteran claimants only)
2. Pension benefits (Veteran claimants only)
3. Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC), also referred to as "Survivor benefits" (Dependent claimants only)

\
ITF is optional; in the event there is no ITF, the date of claim submission or receipt is typically used as the potential start date for benefits payments, although there are [exceptions to this rule](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000180492/M21-1-Part-V-Subpart-ii-Chapter-4-Section-A-Effective-Dates).


## Problem Statement

How might we provide accredited representatives with an easy-to-use tool, to encourage establishing Intent to File on behalf of a Veteran or dependent, as soon as possible?


## Desired User Outcomes

1. After accepting a POA request, accredited representatives have an easy, simple way to establish ITF for the Veteran or dependent they now represent.
2. An accredited representative can establish ITF immediately after accepting the POA request, or at a later date/time.
3. Accredited representatives can establish ITF for all available types: Disability compensation, Pension benefits and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC).
4. Accredited representatives can only establish ITF per type at a time. If a claimant requires multiple ITFs, the representative will need to go through the ITF experience multiple times -- one for each type.
5. Accredited representatives can confirm their POA prior to establishing an ITF for a claimant.
6. Accredited representatives can understand if an ITF already exists, prior to establishing an ITF for a claimant.
7. Accredited representatives can establish an ITF before submitting a claim via VA Form 526EZ.


## Undesired User Outcomes

1. The ITF establishment process for accredited representatives should not be confusing.
2. If an ITF already exists for a claimant, an accredited representative should not be able to establish duplicate ITFs.
3. Accredited representatives should not be able to establish multiple types of ITFs for a claimant in a single submission.


## Desired Business Outcomes

1. Obtain feature parity with SEP, the legacy system for accredited representatives that is scheduled to sunset by January 2026.
2. Addressing a user pain point reported in research, calling out the need to auto-establish ITF for claimants in the Accredited Representative Portal.


## Undesired Business Outcomes

1. We want to avoid opening up a pathway that enables the creation of duplicate ITFs


## Assumptions

1. Accredited representatives have the need to establish an ITF for the majority of claimants that they represent.
2. Accredited representatives must represent (i.e. have POA) for a claimant prior to establishing an ITF on the claimant's behalf.
3. There is no advantage to establishing duplicate ITFs.

## Measuring Success

### KPIs

The success of our ITF product can be presumed, if we observe a high percentage of accepted POA requests in the Accredited Representative Portal (ARP), that are followed by the establishment of an ITF for claimants who do not already have an established ITF.\
\
This success can be measured by the following metrics:

1. Feature usage (need to see if comparison data exists from SEP) -- ideally, the total number of ITFs established via ARP.
2. % of POA acceptances that also include ITF submission


### OKRs

Number 3 from the [Digital Service Delivery OKRs](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:i:/r/sites/vaabdvro/Shared%20Documents/Accredited%20Representatives/metrics%20goals%20OKRS%20measurement/2025%20DSD%20OKRs.png?csf=1\&web=1\&e=WYFuEP): Relentlessly improve user experience (deliver at least one release that directly addresses a documented user pain point)

## Release History

ITF 1.0 (MVP) in the Accredited Representative Portal is targeted to release no later than January 2026. Release Plan TBD.


## Recommended Next Steps

In future iterations of ITF, the team is interested in exploring alternate entry points that may present opportunities to pre-fill the claimant's information within the ITF experience.
