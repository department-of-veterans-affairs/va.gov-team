# Form 21a (Digital Accreditation)

## Problem overview 

Before attorneys or claims agents can help Veterans with claims, they need to become accredited through VA. To become accredited, they need to submit [Form 21a](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21a/), which the Office of General Counsel (OGC) uses to verify the applicant’s credentials and reputation. Claims agents then need to complete a written test verifying they have sufficient knowledge of the claims process. 

This form is currently a paper form. OGC would like to cut down on the time needed to process the form by digitizing it. In the digitization process, they would like to add additional questions that they would normally have to reach out to the applicant to ask. This should result in less back-and-forth with the applicant.

Current stakeholder pain points:
* OGC currently has to reach out to applicants to ask follow up questions, depending on how they respond to the questions in the standard form.
* OGC currently has a 2,000 applicant backlog. Their staff is massively overworked–they don’t have enough staff to process all the applicants they have.
* This backlog and lack of staffing resources means that applicants take several years to complete. (Note that a [PDF](https://www.va.gov/OGC/docs/Accred/HowtoApplyforAccreditation.pdf) linked to from the [OGC website](https://www.va.gov/ogc/accreditation.asp) says 60-120 days, but we’ve heard from a recently accredited claims agent that her process took 2 years.)
* From a process standpoint, OGC has been “burned” by working in an agile fashion before–teams have told them that they’ll build features in future versions, and it never gets done. They prefer to wait to release the digitized form until it has the entire set of features that they need to get their work done.

This digitized form will be one feature in the **Accredited Representative Portal (ARP)**, which is envisioned to be a one-stop-shop for accredited representatives to get accredited and support Veterans and their dependents with their claims. 

**For more information on the product and process of digitizing Form21a, view the [21a accreditation product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representative-facing/product-info/21a-digital-accreditation-product-outline.md).**

## The end user

The end user is similar to our other projects, like [Contact Information Updating](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jNf8Xa9HkDgWAfexjcttyGvsu3FOEVRG4qq6rcA0Og8/edit#heading=h.4xu2nqsuzjyi). However, our users have not yet become accredited, which means that they have a slightly different set of goals, needs, and pain points. We know from our research in August 2024 that applicants experience the below pain points during the accreditation process: 

* Little to no transparency from OGC about the status of their application
* Calling OGC does not result in more information
* They want to begin helping Veterans, but feel like they’re stuck in limbo for an indefinite amount of time

Applicants tell us that there are Reddit and Facebook where people share their experiences about the accreditation process. 

The below personas reflect the goals, pain points, and other information for _accredited_ users, some of which will be applicable to this project’s users:

* [Accredited attorney persona](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1717533456497/60064424f651818203ff49ac43d6fb9f0f2bccac?sender=u8cf3f08a008c2b61ad621433) (Mural) - Representation of what we know about attorneys based on secondary research (previous studies, conversations with OGC), and primary research conducted with attorneys in August 2024.
* [Accredited claims agent persona](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1718731869465/cf73b89eddb92c604d292554a31e503f7ce5d982?sender=u8cf3f08a008c2b61ad621433) (Mural) - Representation of what we know about claims agents based on secondary research (previous studies, conversations with OGC), and primary research conducted with claims agents in August 2024.

## Proposed next steps
* Address [Midpoint Review feedback](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/milestone/1398) (linked to from the [Collaboration Cycle ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/91879)). The ARF team took the v5 designs to Midpoint Review on 9/16/24. We have not incorporated the Midpoint Feedback into the v5 designs, but are summarizing the feedback here:
  * [Design](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/92899):
    * SHOULD: Include mobile designs in the future 
    * SHOULD: Use the [tile radio button component](https://design.va.gov/components/form/radio-button#tile) for the mailing address question
  * [Information Architecture](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/93069): 
    * MUST open any links in a new tab and add text saying they will do so
    * SHOULD: Give a visual cue that Veterans are in the wrong place (similar to the blue alert we have on [21-22 mocks](https://www.figma.com/design/LVCQBuW7a6nfVFNyhA4kv4/ARF---Form-21-22-Design-Explorations?node-id=854-146725&t=RqUG2a8vMUfxnfaI-1))
    * In Step 6 specifically...
        * SHOULD: Shorten the H3s
        * SHOULD: Add missing heading on the [conditions or impairments](https://www.figma.com/design/2afIGOMII0uRI5ck1dWo1w/ARF---Form-21a---Apply-for-Accreditation-(CA-%26-Attorneys)?node-id=1026-24112&t=nOYR6et7OrNqA16g-4) page
          * (Note from ARF Design: as a rule of thumb, we only included H3s on a page if 1) there were multiple fields that were thematically grouped together and 2) they needed a header to make sense of them. An example would be "Employer address". You could understand a field on this page labeled "City," but you might not know _which_ city you should add without the "Mailing address" header. For pages that only had 1 field, we did not see a need for an H3. It's possible that we weren't consistent with this across the dozens of pages in the form. Future teams can assess if/when H3s seem appropriate. We suggest working with CAIA on this.)
        * SHOULD: Add a note about if physical limitations will impact your application
        * CONSIDER: Adding a warning about sensitive questions ahead of Step 6
        * CONSIDER: Clarify language, or create two separate questions, for conditions/impairments pages. The [conditions or impairments](https://www.figma.com/design/2afIGOMII0uRI5ck1dWo1w/ARF---Form-21a---Apply-for-Accreditation-(CA-%26-Attorneys)?node-id=1026-24112&t=nOYR6et7OrNqA16g-4). It combines substance use disorders and mental illness as potential factors to consider for fitness to serve.
        * CONSIDER: Update disability and substance abuse disorder language on conditions/impairments pages. This section uses some out of date language around disability and substance abuse.
  * [Content](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/93072):
    * MUST: Use contractions
    * MUST: Try to use plain language where possible
  * [Accessibility](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/93097): 
    * MUST code the custom header and footer in ways that are accessible 
    * MUST make any H3 unique text (don't repeat the text below or on other pages)
    * SHOULD consider and mock the mobile experience
    * SHOULD strive for more plain language
    * SHOULD give more explanations around the questions about physical limitations (see IA feedback above)
* Continue to update the staging site so that it matches OGC's desired fields and functionality. 
  * See [Figma v5 (Future version)](https://www.figma.com/design/2afIGOMII0uRI5ck1dWo1w/ARF---Form-21a---Apply-for-Accreditation-(CA-%26-Attorneys)?node-id=1026-23089&t=luaHQGKRIHwSK1V0-1) for the latest round of applied feedback.
  * Tickets capturing these changes compared to the current state can be found in the [project board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/accredited-representative-facing-team-65453a97a9cc36069a2ad1d6/board?labels=arf-eng) and filtering by "Form 21a".
* Continue to collaborate with the GCLAWS team to update the schema for successful 21a submission.
  * GCLAWS is the database that the digitized Form 21a will ultimately submit to. It is under OGC's technical umbrella outside of OCTO, and the GCLAWS team we interface with is in charge of creating the API endpoints the form will need to submit to.
  * This team primarily communicates via Teams inside the VA network, using the `Accreditation Portal (va.gov)` channel.
  * Inside that Teams channel is a shared file directory. An [Excel spreadsheet](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/OITSPMGCLAWS-VBAIntegrations/Shared%20Documents/Accreditation%20Portal%20(va.gov)/21a%20Design%20Feedback/v5/ARF%20-%20GCLAWS%20alignment%20spreadsheet%20v5%20%5Ball%20new%20requested%20fields%5D.xlsx?d=wced87ea864214601b2e9b2de165ab100&csf=1&web=1&e=wPkYjc) has been used to track field parity between systems during development. If you cannot access that Sharepoint link, it can be found in the Teams channel: `Accreditation Portal (va.gov) -> Files -> 21a Design Feedback -> v5`
* Add schema validation to `vets-json-schema` for the vets-api controller before submission to GCLAWS
* Design and build a dashboard from which applicants can return to see the status of their application and update information. See the [annotations about a dashboard in Step 10 of v5 designs](https://www.figma.com/design/2afIGOMII0uRI5ck1dWo1w/ARF---Form-21a---Apply-for-Accreditation-(CA-%26-Attorneys)?node-id=1509-182262&t=DWVSpO8z40MZ9EYQ-1).
* (Optional) Explore designs that would both benefit Form 21a and also have wider applicability across the design system. That includes elements discussed on the [Additional Designs to Explore Figma page](https://www.figma.com/design/2afIGOMII0uRI5ck1dWo1w/ARF---Form-21a---Apply-for-Accreditation-(CA-%26-Attorneys)?node-id=1509-178160&t=sxPiNdXIgp6duXuI-1), including a progress bar, enhanced card, navigating between steps, and more.
* (Optional) Push some of the repeated patterns from this form back to the Forms Library for easier re-use by other teams. Candidates for re-usable patterns could include:
   * the "still [working/attending/living] here" checkboxes associated with date ranges
   * internationalPhone pattern
   * date formatting for review pages
* Run usability testing to validate some of the design decisions about the digitized form. (Add link to plan once it's ready) See the [Future Research Activities Mural board](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1718980793805/b1c89e3110a00b235ee30bc04bab3cc96a33c696?sender=u2a4240a640b257ce33545495) for more information on proposed research studies about 21a and other ARP features.
* As we get closer to launch, explore ways that we can meld the IA/header and footer for this feature (Form 21a) with the other features our team explored (21-22 and contact info updating). The IA that gets selected for the initial ARP release will be entirely dependent on which feature(s) go live first. These features have been designed independently so far, but if two features go live at the same time, the team will need to explore how it should be presented.
