# Research Findings   
### Overview  
The research overview outlines a usability study conducted with 6 SCOs with extensive experience supporting Veterans across the United States (US). The study aimed to assess the ease of accessing key resources on the Resources for Schools page and gather feedback on potential additions. Each session lasted 45 minutes.   
### Methodology   
The study utilized a combination of task-based assessment and free explore sessions to gather insights into usability and immediate reactions to the updated page design.   
### Purpose   
The "Resources for Schools" web page is actively utilized to maintain consistent communication during training, facilitate onboarding for new SCOs, and assist supervisors in understanding the SCO role. The current page encounters issues with outdated information and challenges in finding specific details. Users note the need for improved layout and better organization of key resources.

### Key Findings and Recommendations   
#### Finding 1: Enrollment Manager   
Participants highly prioritize easy access to the Enrollment Manager, acknowledging its crucial role in their work. However, they have encountered challenges in swiftly locating it when needed. 
“75% of my job is spent here [enrollment manager].” – P3   

#### Recommendation 1: Enrollment Manager
* Replace the GovDelivery promo with Enrollment Manager for direct access.
* Maintain Enrollment Manager along with its user guides in “Additional Resources” section.

#### Finding 2: Handbooks   
SCOs appreciate the updated handbook section design. However, some SCOs emphasized the significance of the VR&E program and requested that the handbook section include a direct link to the VR&E handbook.
“Any type of handbook that’s a training resource... should be placed here. ” – P5   

#### Recommendation 2: Handbooks   
* Rename section to “Handbooks” to maintain accuracy and support scannability of headers.
* Include a direct link to the VR&E handbook in the Handbook section.

#### Finding 3: Education Service Webinars and Training   
SCOs had mixed familiarity with the "Education Service Webinars and Training" page as an entry point for office hours. While some recognized it, others overlooked the link and supplemental text below the link.
“I call this the office hours link, it’s also webinars, but I just call it office hours link.” - P3   

#### Recommendation 3: Education Service Webinars and Training  
* Improve visibility and design by adding "Office Hours" to the link, ensuring a more streamlined experience findings them.
* Remove “Education Service” to support scannability, E.g., “Office Hours & Webinars.”

#### Finding 4: GovDelivery   
SCOs value signing up for GovDelivery. Given the Enrollment Manager's prioritization findings, it is still important to promote GovDelivery sign-ups. Some participants viewed GovDelivery as a key task in SCO training, suggesting its inclusion in the training section.
“Make it critical that they sign up for gov mailing list, just like getting approved for enrollment management” – P4   

#### Recommendation 4: GovDelivery  
* Place a GovDelivery link within the Trainings and webinars section as this is where SCOs get notified about training and events.
* Also, keep GovDelivery in the “Connect with us” section.

### Additional Findings and Recommendations
**Covered Institution Status**
* Finding: The placement of the "Covered Institution Status" caused confusion and was considered redundant in its current section as the same information can be found under “Training Requirements”.   
* Recommendation: Remove “Covered Institution Status” from page confirmed in our debrief January 19th, 2024.

**Program Approvals**
* Finding: Some SCOs expressed hesitancy about the section "Program Approvals." Additionally, there was confusion about the term “Domestic” in “Domestic School Program Approvals”.
“What is the program approvals? Are they degrees or programs that the VA would approve? – P5”
* Recommendation: Broaden the scope and clarify of the section's purpose – to  understand requirements and be approved, e.g., “Program eligibility and approval.” Rename “Domestic School Program Approval” a 1:1 with the page title, “School Program Approval.”

**WEAMS**
* Finding: SCOs consistently access WEAMS, relying on it to confirm their program’s approval. However, some have resorted to searching under additional resources to find it. 
“I am wondering how I would get to WEAMS now?” – P6
* Recommendation: Lead the “Program eligibility and approvals” section with WEAMS as it is the most frequently accessed link in the list. Reinforce understanding by spelling out the abbreviation "WEAMS" (Web Enabled Approval Management System), ensuring that the acronym is readily recognizable.

**Upload portal & form library**
* Finding: SCOs generally appreciate both the Education File Upload Portal and the Form library. However, many did not highlight them as critical to their daily workflow compared to other tools. Additionally, some participants wondered what documents could be uploaded and suggested that providing a list of acceptable documents.
* Recommendation: reate a dedicated section called "Upload files to VA." Within this new section, users can access the Education File Upload Portal and the form library in one place. The Form library accordion also serves as a list of files that can be uploaded, offering clear guidance on acceptable document types, providing value rather than redundancy.

**Payment and debt**
* Finding: An SCO shared the importance of maintaining consistency in the links from the previous Resources for Schools page, noting that they frequently relied on links that have since been removed.
“So you guys removed the debt management payment part of this?” – P3
* Add back the links related to student payment and debt information resources, along with information on school overpayments and the use of the dual certification process to prevent them. Incorporate audience headers within accordions to organize links effectively.

**VR&E**   
* Finding: SCOs emphasize the importance of VR&E and suggest several enhancements to streamline resources for improved support including direct links to Tungsten, VR&E eligibility, and contacts.
“It would be helpful to know where to find the link for Tungsten access ” – P4
* Recommendation: Provide a link for direct access to Tungsten. Include a link to the VR&E eligibility page, application page, and a contact page, if available. Incorporate audience headers within accordions to organize links effectively.

**Veteran Education Benefits**   
* Finding: SCOs are unclear about the target audience for the "Learn about Veteran Education Benefits" section. While they're interested in GI Bill benefits, the comparison tool, and rates, links like "Choosing school" seem tailored to students and may cause confusion as they're irrelevant to SCO roles.
“This information is for the students, not the SCOs.” - P1
* Recommendation: Rename the section title to "Understanding Veteran Education Benefits" to clearly communicate purpose and value to SCOs. Adjust descriptions to be SCO-oriented for better comprehension and relevance. Replace "Choosing a GI Bill Approved Schools" with "GI Bill Comparison Tool" to offer SCOs a more relevant resource. Eliminate student-oriented pages since SCOs can direct students to relevant information accessible from the "About GI Bill Benefits" section.

**Additional Resources**   
* Recommendation: To maintain alignment with other hubpages on VA.gov, rename "Additional resources" to "Other resources for schools."

**Welcome Video (Proposed)**   
* Finding: If a video is required on the page, SCOs emphasize the importance of a value, rather than just a welcome message, to prevent it from being intrusive. The video should offer essential information for new SCOs, such as access points and available resources. It should express appreciation, acknowledge feedback, and highlight collaboration opportunities with SCOs as key elements.
“If it doesn’t include functional information, then I don’t really know that it matters where you put it.” - P1

### Future Considerations   
**Gather feedback for continuous improvement**
* Solicit feedback upon the page's re-launch through various channels such as Office Hours and SCO Collaboration Group.
* Consider the distribution of surveys for SCOs to provide feedback about page updates and additional improvements we can consider in the future. E.g. “Share your feedback about the updated Resources for Schools page” – 2-3 questions, open between SCO Collaboration Group meetings.

**Streamline access to updates**   
* SCOs expressed frustration with the current process of searching through emails for updates and noted the risk of sharing inaccurate information with Veterans.
* Consider opportunities to provide access for SCOs to the latest policy and community updates (e.g.,  GovDelivery archive/ Topic RSS Feed).

**Enhance handbook user experience**   
* Provide an option for users to download or print the handbook for convenience.
* Maintain a consistent URL so SCOs can easily bookmark the page.

**Offer additional resources to SCOs**   
* Draft an FAQ document for new SCOs. This document will assist new SCOs in navigating the process without missing essential steps, better serving the schools and Veterans.
* Gather commonly asked questions from students to SCOs and create an additional resource.
