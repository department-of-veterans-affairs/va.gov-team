### Section A: Welcome and Introduction (5 minutes)

4. Welcome and Introduction (2 minutes):
    * Good afternoon! Thank you for joining me today. My name is David and we also have a few members of our team observing and taking notes for this session.
    * I’m an independent consultant working with the VA and I'm here to discuss outreach event creation[ VA.gov](http://VA.gov).
    * Today's conversation is about gathering your thoughts on the New Event editor in the CMS system to improve the user experience for event editors like yourself.
5. Ground Rules (3 minute):
    * I’m going to go over some key points before we get started.

        2. There are no right or wrong answers. I’m here to learn from you and get your opinions, this is not a test and I am not testing you.
        3. Your feedback will help improve VA.gov.
        4. With your permission I’ll be audio and screen recording today’s session. These recordings will help me remember what we discussed and look at. These recordings will be deleted within 90 days. 
        5. I’ll be writing a report based on feedback from you and a number of other people – but I won’t include your name in my report.

**I’m going to start the recording now, is that okay with you?** _(If participant says yes, start audio & screen recording.)_

**Do you agree to participate in this session? _(Seek verbal confirmation from participants.)_**

**A few other logistics…**
