**User Behavior and Engagement:**

1. _Limited Frequent Visits:_ The majority of SCOs do not frequently visit the Resources for Schools page, despite its promotion by the education training team at events.
2. _Resource Hub Functionality:_ Participants noted that the page serves as a resource hub, reminding SCOs of requirements. Users commonly do not have a specific agenda when visiting, relying on the page to guide them.

**Bookmarking and Recognition:**

1. _Bookmarking Specific Links:_ Many SCOs bookmark specific links for ease of access, indicating a preference for direct navigation to relevant information.
2. _Difficulty Finding the Page:_ Some SCOs mentioned difficulties in locating the page from[ VA.gov](http://VA.gov). A suggestion was made to change the label from "School Administrators" to "Resources for Schools" for improved recognition.

**Reasons for Page Visits:**  

SCOs visit the page for several reasons:

1. Training new SCOs.
2. Accessing general resources, particularly the SCO Handbook.
3. Seeking rules and regulations for less-common circumstances (e.g., study abroad).
4. Finding office hours links and times.
5. Staying updated with the latest information.
6. Importance of maintaining VR&E information on the page for reference.

**Frustrations with the Current Page:**

1. _Infrequent Updates:_ SCOs expressed frustration with the page's infrequent updates, particularly regarding information about outages with the enrollment manager, new rules, and updates.
2. _Outdated Links:_ Some links on the page were reported as not being up to date, causing potential confusion.

**Feedback on Updated Page:**

1. _Positive Layout Improvement:_ Participants noted a positive response to the improved layout, stating that it makes the page appear more user-friendly and easier to navigate.
2. _Appreciation for "Upload to VA" Feature:_ SCOs generally liked the addition of the "Upload to VA" feature, although there was a request for additional information about its functionality.
3. _Difficulty Finding "Gov Delivery" Link:_ Locating the "Gov Delivery" link was identified as a challenge, impacting the ease of access to important notifications.

**User Recommendations:**

1. _Handbook Last Update:_ Ensure the Handbook is regularly updated, and prominently display the last update date on the page. _(REMOVED BECAUSE IT WILL REQUIRE MANUAL UPDATE CURRENTLY)_
2. _Document Upload Details:_ Provide details about the types of documents that can be uploaded without clicking, enhancing user transparency.
3. _Alignment with "GovDelivery":_ Use the term "GovDelivery" consistently to align with the newsletter, improving user recognition.

**Future considerations, to be verified during usability testing:**

1. _GovDelivery Messages Archive:_ Develop an archive feature for GovDelivery messages to provide access to historical communications.
2. _Education Call Number:_ Introduce an education call number for quick reference to enhance user support.
3. _Enrollment Manager Breakdown:_ Provide a detailed breakdown of the Enrollment Manager for improved user understanding.
4. _Latest Updates Section:_ Create a dedicated "Latest Updates" section to ensure easy access to the most recent information.

**Conclusion:** The focus group findings offer valuable insights into the user experience of SCOs with the "Resources for Schools" page. Addressing the identified frustrations and implementing user recommendations, both low and high LOE, can significantly enhance the page's usability, aligning it more closely with the needs and expectations of SCOs on[ VA.gov](http://VA.gov).
