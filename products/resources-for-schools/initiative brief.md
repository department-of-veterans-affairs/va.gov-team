##### Prod URL:

##### Product Overview:

School Administrator Product is an Education affiliated product that is not Veteran facing. It is utilized by School Certifying Officials (SCOs) to gain up to date information via their handbook, find answers to frequently asked questions, see events and announcements and locate other resources.


##### Problem Statement

The School Administrator page currently does not have an internal VA assigned team to iterate on the webpage. Education Benefits members previously have manually gone into github to make edits and try to do other changes to the website with varying degrees of difficulty. Isolating the work done to one team will prevent any accidents and alleviate the burden on the current employees.

On initial overview not functioning as desired or showing outdated material.

From a design and accessibility perspective, the webpage does not follow the latest VA design system. Accessibility tests show high performance with small room for improvement.

From a technical perspective, the webpage shows content that is not currently populating or contains pieces of data that could be removed entirely as they are no longer providing meaningful user data.


##### User(s)

Internal Education Product Stakeholders who:

* Are interacting with SCOs and directing them to seek out information on the webpage

* Have new information or data that should be reflected on the webpage

* Are product owners for the web page and want to see a more refined product

School Certifying Officials who:

* Want to quickly digest the available data and have confidence in its accuracy.


##### Desired Outcomes

Product owner will no longer be updating github to edit data. 

Visitors will have a cohesive experience when navigating to this webpage from the va.gov homepage.

Data displayed on the webpage will be accurate with functioning content links.


##### Desired Business Outcomes

Web Page is updated with the va.gov style guide

Data is accurate and up to date.

Ongoing changes to the application result in reduction of resources and progress from other projects.


##### Assumptions

[Assumptions are things we want to list as things we believe to be true, and that we may need to test or validate about the work]

IIR will own the School Administrator product from a technical side for the duration of the contract.

Updates will be ongoing during time of ownership.

Collab Cycle and Content Management will be assumed unless specifically called out.


##### Solution Approach/Hypotheses -

Tickets will be created by IIR Product Manager to be immediately or within a similar timeframe pulled into the current ongoing sprint.


##### KPIs:

Links on webpage will be current and active

Dates represented on the webpage will be current and active

SCOs ability to digest and locate data will improve (verbal feedback via stakeholder) 


##### Timeline

Initial Discovery: 1 two-week Sprint

Initial Implementation and Technical Eval: 1 two-week Sprint

Product Implementation and Path Forward Proof of Concept: 1 two-week Sprint

Additional Sprints if necessary to satisfy stakeholder edits
