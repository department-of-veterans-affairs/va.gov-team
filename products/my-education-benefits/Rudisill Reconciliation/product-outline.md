# Rudisill Recondiliation - Dual Benefit Eligibility Tool Product Outline
---

## Overview

Streamlining the Veteran experience by creating a simple and accessible tool for Veterans, impacted by legistlation changes, to maximize their education benefits.

## Problem Statement

Education benefits can be hard to navigate for our Veteran population due to the variety of their circumstances; this can become more complicated when legislation changes and provides different criteria for eligibility. With the impact of Rudisill, Veterans need clear guidance and streamlined, accessible tools to help them maximize the education benefits they are entitled to. 
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Veterans should be able to allocate their remaining qualifying days of service to maximize their benefit outcomes according to their education goals.
    - For example: a Veteran who relinquished their MGIB benefit (to use their PGIB benefits) and qualifies for both MGIB and PGIB education benefits under Rudisill should be able to distribute their qualifying days of service to gain entitlement under both.
- Veterans should easily understand the outcome of their allocation and that decisions made within the Dual Benefit Eligibility Tool will impact their existing benefits. 


## Undesired User Outcomes

- Use cases for Veterans impacted by Rudisill are complex and nuanced, the copy and organization must be carefully considered to ensure Veterans are not further confused when using this tool.
- Veterans may not understand that updates to their allocation will change their existing benefits. 

## Desired Business Outcomes

- The Dual Benefit Eligibility Tool aims to help Veterans understand their existing benefits, provide a recommended allocation to help Veterans maximize their education benefits, and easily make updates to them based on their education goals streamling the Veteran education application experience  

   
## Undesired Business Outcomes

- Users accept the recommendation or customize their allocations in a way that does not meet their education goals.
  - Business logic will be well considered to ensure we providing the best recommendation for users and provide users with a simple way to make their own allocation, when the recommendation is not the best fit for the user.

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

## Assumptions

The following assumptions have been made when creating our solution:

- Veterans have familiarity with terms related to education eligibility and entitlment (e.g. months of entitlment, qualifying days of service, benefit level, kicker).
- Some Veterans who use the tool may not have an in-depth understanding of their benefits 
   - Veterans can understand from using the tool, the relationship between their qualifying days of service and their benefit outcome.
- Some Veterans who use the tool may have an in-depth understanding of their benefits (considered super users).

## Solution Approach

- We've developed our solution as a tool that will live on the 'Manage your benefits' section of VA.gov's Education and training page since the tool is meant to help Veterans make changes to their benefits.

- We have developed a solution that:
  - Presents information we have on file for the user to them, to build their trust in the tool
  - Asks questions to gather further information about the user's goals, to better inform the recommendation we'll provide
  - Provides a recommendation up front for users who may need more assistance when making their allocation
  - Provide an alternative 'Customizable allocation' for users who want further personalization to their allocation
 
- This is a first draft solution and we are noting, for further iterations, that this solution should be flexible to legislation changes and court decisions/reversals

### Supporting research
   
- We plan to do user testing with Veterans to validate the solution's
    - Information heirarchy and organization helps simplify the allocation process
    - Language is clear for users 
    - Recommendation provided to users is easily understood
    - Alternative paths (customized allocation) is intuitive and simple for users to find and use
