# Rudisill Reconciliation - Dual Benefit Eligibility Tool Product Outline
---

## Overview

Streamlining the Veteran experience by creating a simple and accessible tool for Veterans, impacted by legislation changes, to maximize their education benefits.

## Problem Statement

Education benefits can be hard to navigate for our Veteran population due to the variation of their circumstances; this can become more complicated when legislation changes impact eligibility criteria. To support Veterans with the impact of Rudisill, clear guidance and a streamlined, accessible tool should be developed to help Veterans maximize the education benefits they are entitled to. 
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Veterans should be able to allocate their remaining qualifying service to maximize their benefit outcomes according to their education goals.
    - For example: a Veteran who relinquished their MGIB benefit (to use their PGIB benefits) and now qualifies for both MGIB and PGIB under Rudisill; should be able to distribute their qualifying service to gain entitlement under both.
- Veterans should easily understand the outcome and impact of the allocation made within the Dual Benefit Eligibility Tool, and that it will impact their existing benefits. 


## Undesired User Outcomes

- Use cases for Veterans impacted by Rudisill are complex and nuanced, the copy and organization must be carefully considered to ensure Veterans are not further confused when using this tool.
- Veterans may not understand that updates to their allocation will change their existing benefits. 

## Desired Business Outcomes

- The Dual Benefit Eligibility Tool aims to help Veterans understand their existing benefits, provide a recommended allocation to help Veterans maximize their education benefits, and easily make updates to them based on their education goals streamlining the Veteran education application experience  

   
## Undesired Business Outcomes

- Users accept the recommendation or customize their allocation in a way that does not meet their education goals.
  - Business logic will be well considered to ensure we providing the best recommendation for users and provide users with a simple way to make their own allocation, when the recommendation is not the best fit for them.

## Assumptions

The following assumptions have been made when creating our solution:

- Veterans have some familiarity with terms related to education eligibility and entitlment (e.g. months of entitlment, qualifying service, benefit level, kicker).
- Some Veterans who use the tool may not have an in-depth understanding of their benefits 
   - Veterans, will understand by using the tool, the relationship between their qualifying service and their benefit outcome.
- Some Veterans who use the tool may have an in-depth understanding of their benefits (considered super users).

## Solution Approach

- We've developed our solution as a tool that will live on the 'Manage your benefits' section of VA.gov's 'Education and training' page since the tool is meant to help Veterans make changes to their benefits.

- We have developed a solution that:
  - Presents information we have on file for the user to them, to build their trust in the tool
  - Asks questions to gather further information about the user's goals, to better inform the recommendation we'll provide
  - Provides a recommendation up front for users who may need more assistance when making their allocation
  - Provide an alternative 'Customizable allocation' for users who want further personalization to their allocation
 
- This is a first draft solution and we are noting, for further iterations, that this solution should be flexible to legislation changes and court decisions/reversals

### Supporting research
   
- We plan to do user testing with Veterans to validate that the solution's
    - Information heirarchy and organization helps simplify the allocation process
    - Language is clear for users 
    - Recommendation is easily understood by users
    - Alternative paths (customized allocation) is intuitive and easy for users to find and use
