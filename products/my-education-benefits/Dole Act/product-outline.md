# Dole Act Section 210 Electronic Letters - Product Outline

---

## Overview
Recent legislation, Elizabeth Dole Act - Section 210, mandates that Veterans should have electronic means to access letters and documents related to their GI Bill education benefits. Electronic letter functionality will be incorporated into key touchpoints, within the education hub and VA profile of VA.gov, allowing Veterans to opt in/out of electronic letter communications and download their education documents.  

## Problem Statement
How might we streamline GI Bill beneficiaries' access to important information regarding their education benefits
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Previously, GI Bill beneficiaries had limited access to their education letters. Immediate access is only available for a beneficiary's most recent education decision letter, access to all other education letters must go through an Ask VA request 
- GI Bill beneficiaries will now be able to easily and quickly access letters (dated after 2022) related to their education benefits via their signed-in account on VA.gov
- GI Bill beneficiaries will now be able to seamlessly set and update their preference for education letter communication (mail or electronic) within their VA.gov account

## Desired Business Outcomes

Allowing GI Bill beneficiaries access to letters and documents relating to their education benefits will:
- Improve and quicken communications between the VA and GI Bill beneficiaries
- Reduce Ask VA requests
- Reduce costs related to printing and mailing of letters
- Provide a consolidated secure location for important documentation relating to a GI Bill beneficiary's education benefits ultimately streamlining and improving the Veteran experience

## Assumptions
- Which touchpoints users will likely access their education letters from and opt in/out of communications
- Which letters can be accessed electronically 

## Solution Approach

We have interpreted the legislative change and identified all relevant touch points within VA.gov's education hub and within the VA profile. We have narrowed the touch points to:
- Online education applications - opt in/out of electronic letter delivery
- VA profile notification settings - opt in/out of electronic letter delivery
- [Download you VA education letter](https://www.va.gov/education/download-letters/) - search for and download letters and documents related to their education benefits

The following considerations have been taken into account when designing our solution:
- The availability of letters (noting that letters delivered before 2022 cannot be retrieved as they are not part of My Education Benefits)
- Constraints of backend calls to our letters service
- Constraints of retrieving letters via SSN or claimant ID
- Designing an intuitive search functionality for users
  
### Supporting research

Electronic letter functionality iterates on features and pages that already exist on VA.gov. New functionality is expected to have minor updates to the online education applications, VA profile notification settings, and [Download you VA education letter](https://www.va.gov/education/download-letters/) page. Updates will follow existing VA design system guidelines, leverage office hours, and are not expected to radically change the existing user experience.
