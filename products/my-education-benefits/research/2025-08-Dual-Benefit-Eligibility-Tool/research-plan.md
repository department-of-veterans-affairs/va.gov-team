	# Research Plan for [DGIB Team, My Education Benefits, Summer 2025]

## Background 
We are creating a new tool that allows users, who are impacted by Rudisill and eligible for both Post-9/11 GI Bill (PGIB) or Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) education benefits, the ability to allocate their qualifying service to both benefits. Rudisill requires GI Bill benefciaries to make updates that may change their benefit type, benefit level and entitlement (where applicable). It is important for users to 
- Easily understand the outcomes of their allocation prior to making their decision  
- Have a simple and streamlined process for them to do so. 

The tool will help users understand their allocated service for either benefit in terms of real outcomes (i.e. a change in education benefit level, updated number of months of entitlement). Ultimately users should be able to understand the outcomes of their allocation as it relates to benefit level, months of entitlement, and other important benefit information by using this tool. In doing so, GI Bill beneficiaries have the best opportunity to choose the best education benefit outcome for their circumstances.
</br>	
- `What problem is your product trying to solve?` </br>
Veterans and beneficiaries who are impacted by the recent Rudisill court decision do not have a streamlined nor simple way to retain or reverse relinquishment of MGIB and/or allocate their service to the different benefit types. The Dual Bnefit Eligibility tool will provide users the ability to allocate their service, understand how service allocated translates to benefit level or entitlement, and make their decision in one flow. </br>
- `Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`</br>
We are planning for this tool to exist on its own page but linked from the 'Manage your Veterans education benefits' section. The planned IA is: VA.gov home > VA education and training benefits > Dual Benefit Eligibility Tool
- `What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?` </br>
The Dual Benefit Eligbility Tool would be a new product on a new page

### OCTO-DE Priorities
Objective 1:  VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.  

### Veteran Journey
Reinventing Myself - Aquiring the appropriate education, new skills, and credentials: Veterans and beneficiaries will have the ability to receieve benefits that better fit their circumstances and/or gain more education benefits depending on their service. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Research Goals	
- Gather more insight into GI Bill beneficiares understanding of benefit language and what terminology would be most beneficial to see
- Determine if the organization of information and layout in the flow, primarly in the allocation step, is intuitive and easy for users
- Assess users' trust and confidence using the tool and in making decisions related to their education benefits
  
### Outcome
User research will inform improvements needed and validate interactions in the flow, information displayed, and allocation method that will best help users easily understand and make decisions in regards to changing or updating their education benefit(s).

### Research questions
1. Do users understand the information presented about them first in the flow? Does it build their trust? </br>
2. How familiar are users with the benefit language and terminology used with the tool? What other language are beneficiaries familiar with?
3. Is the heirarchy of information and layout clear for users? Does it help them understand our recommendation and their current benefit level? 
4. Do users trust the recommendation? If not, are users able to create their own allocation with both ease and confidence? </br>
5. Is the impact to their benefits clearly outlined and easily understood by users? </br>

### Hypotheses
The impact of Rudisill has left many GI Bill beneficiaries confused on what actions they can take to better utilize their education benefits. We hypothesize that by using this tool, users will have a better understanding of how Rudisill impacts their benefits by translating their qualifying service to real outcomes. We hypothesize that presenting users with clear information about their benefit level, benefit type, entitlement, along with other important information will build their trust in the recommendation. We assume there will be some confusion on the benefit language used and within the allocation step as those are either new interactions or have varied understandings within the GI Bill beneficiary user group.

## Methodology  
We will engage in moderated usability testing conducted remotely using Zoom. Participants will be recruited using Perigean. These users will be asked to consider how they'd look for the Dual Benefit Eligbility Tool, then will be provided a link of the prototype of the feature. The sessions will be recorded, and observers and notetakers may be in attendance.

- Please review the [PRA primer](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/what-is-paperwork-reduction-act.md) to educate yourself on how PRA impacts the research we do as a government project. 
- Review the [Perigean recruitment guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Recruiting-Participants.1958773044.html) to understand how Perigean recruits, and what types of research they can support. 
- If conducting testing on mobile, refer to the [mobile research guidelines.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Conducting-Research-Sessions.1958773061.html#ConductingResearchSessions-Researchingwithmobileusers)
- If conducting [unmoderated usability research, refer to the guidance here.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Planning-Unmoderated-Studies.1904738369.html) 
- If conducting [research with disabled Veterans, refer to this checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-with-assistive-technology-users) and [follow disability etiquette guidelines.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/disability-etiquette)
- In the rare event of an emergency during research, be prepared by reviewing guidelines for [research safety and emergency exit strategies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html).

### Recruitment approach
Our intended audience will be a blend of Veterans who do and do not have experience with GI Bill benefits.

### Recruitment criteria

Our recruiting goal is to have 2 types of representatives:

- Veterans or active-duty Service members who have experience (applied and/or used) GI Bill benefits (Category A)
- Veterans or active-duty Service members who do not have experience with GI Bill benefits (Category B)

**Please recruit for 10 fulfilled sessions (recruit for a total of 15 participants to account for no-show rate)** using the following criteria:

**Must have for participants**
- At least 1 woman of color
- At least 1 participant 55 or older
- At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Veterans)
- At least one person with a disability rating of 80% or greater

**Good to have for participants**
- At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
- At least one person that has a college degree (to include of officer Veterans)
- At least one person who lives in a major metropolitan area

**Please consider**
- At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area

**Recruitment requirements**
- The participants should have Zoom downloaded prior to the session
- The participants should know how to screenshare

**Screening Questions**
- Are you a self-entitled (to GI Bill benefits) Veteran? 
- Have you applied for or used GI Bill benefits before? (IF YES, they are in Category A; IF NO, they are in Category B.)
