**My Education Benefits--DGIB Team  | December 2024**

## Background
We are replacing the outdated, deprecated How to Apply "wizard" that is located on the EDU How to apply and Eligibility sections of VA.gov. Our "EDU Application Recommender Tool" is a 1:1 replacement of the wizard and will programmatically review prospective applicant information on the backend to recommend a likely education application form.

- What problem is your product trying to solve? **Beneficiaries often submit the incorrect form when applying for GI Bill benefits. We want to increase the likelihood that they submit the correct form to reduce the need for resubmissions.** <!-- **Finding a suitable replacement to the current process for locating the correct education benefit form for a Veteran** -->
- Where is your product situated on VA.gov? **Our new tool will replace the "wizard" in the Education and Training hub on the How to Apply page.** <!-- **Authenticated experience will give us the background we need to accurately guide Veterans and their family members to the right form** -->
- What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one? **The Recommender Tool is a new feature on a familiar page. It will replace the "wizard" currently on the How to Apply page.**<!-- **This is a 1:1 replacement with a existing wizard, Veteran familiarty is TBD but prior research has suggested it as confusing, convoluted, and malfunctioning.** -->

### OCTO priorities 
Supports OCTO Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran Journey
Supports Reinventing Myself: Acquiring the appropriate education, credentials and skills. 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 

## Research Goals	
1. Determine what recommendation language will best help GI Bill beneficiaries into the correct form
2. Determine if beneficiaries understand and trust our recommendations 
3. Determine if 'off-ramps' to different education benefits are sufficient for users seeking other educational benefits

### Outcome
User research will help us determine what improvements are needed to the user flow, copy, and information hierarchy to optimize a user's understanding and trust in the tool.<!-- **Research will inform us how well the user flow, copy, and information hierarchy are working for the user. We will use findings to directly improve the tool before deployment. ** -->

### Research questions
1. Do users understand the path forward presented in our 'recommendations'?
2. Do users feel our 'recommendations' are correct based on their circumstances?
3. Do our 'recommendations' deliver the right information so users can proceed with confidence?
4. What else would users consider doing? Do we support those paths?

### Hypothesis
Recent review has uncovered the How to Apply wizard on the Education hub is outdated, faulty, and confusing. We hypothesize that a more straigh-solution that 'automatically' present recommendations will be well-received and trusted. We expect that some laguage presented may be confusing but will generally communicate the options available to users. We expect most users will be able to find avenues to other (No GI Bill) education benefits on the page.

## Methodology	
We will engage in moderated usability testing conducted remotely using Zoom. Participants will be recruited using Perigean. These users will be asked to consider how they'd look for the Recommender Tool, then will be provided links to variations of a prototype of the feature. The sessions will be recorded, and observers and notetakers may be in attendance.

<!-- With sufficient time before deployement to add to our product backlog and improve it before production, we will use usabiltiy testing to generate new ideas on how to improve the recommender tool, but also to validate what is/is not working for the end-user. -->

### Location
Remote sessions via Zoom (set up by Perigean)

- Dependends of a deceased, missing or 100% service-disabled Veteran or Service member (Category C)

**Please recruit for 9 fulfilled sessions** using the following criteria:

**Must have for participants**
- Participants must **have used or are currently using GI Bill benefits**
- At least 1 woman of color

**Please consider**
- At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area

**Recruitment requirements**
- The participants should have Zoom downloaded prior to the session
- The participants should know how to screenshare

<!-- Perigean recruitment, with a goal of 9 total sessions, focusing on primary criteria:

- 3 to 5 Veterans
- 3 to 5 Dependents of Veterans (spouse or child to Veteran) that has used transferred self-entitled benefits before from their Veteran sponsor
- 3 to 5 Dependents of Veterans (spouse of child to Veteran) that is the child or spouse of a Veteran or service member who has passed away, is captured or missing, or is permanently and totally disabled due to a service-connected disability

#### Primary criteria (must-haves)
- Category A: 3 Veterans
- Category B: 3 Dependents of Veterans (spouse or child to Veteran) that has used transferred self-entitled benefits before from their Veteran sponsor
- Category C: 3 Dependents of Veterans (spouse of child to Veteran) that is the child or spouse of a Veteran or service member who has died, is captured or missing, or is permanently and totally disabled due to a service-connected disability

_We would ask that Perigean recruits a diverse demographic breakdown._ -->

#### Screening questions
1. Are you a self-entitled (to GI Bill benefits) Veteran? (IF YES, they are in Category A; IF NO, continue to question 2.)
2. Did your Veteran parent or spouse transfer GI Bill benefits to you? This may have been done using the DEERS system through DoD. (IF YES, they are in Category B. Continue to question 3.)
3. Has your Veteran parent or spouse passed away, is captured or missing, or have a 100% service-connected disability? (IF YES, put into Category C)

## Timeline
<!-- Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.
