# Research Plan for DGIB, My Education Benefits, May 2023
*Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the #research-ops Slack channel.* 

## Background
VA offers education benefits to Veterans, Service members, and their families. Depending on their background, an applicant will need to apply for a specific education benefit that best suits them. Additionally, Post-9/11 GI Bill students now can verify their monthly enrollment in accordance with legislation, Public Law 116-315 Section 1010 and view and download their decision letter on Va.gov. The education form and features we will be focusing on are highlighted below:
- **Authenticated Form 22-1990e** is primarily for spouses or children of the Veteran or service member - who has transferred their education benefits to them. The transfer of entitlement applicant is the thus a spouse or child and applies for the Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. 
- **Online Enrollment Verification** allows Post-9/11 GI Bill students to verify their monthly enrollment information online, a new method.
- **Download your VA education letter** offers a simple way for users to view and download their decision letter almost near real time after application submission. 
These features are in production and are only for authenticated users (signed-in) and will offer a streamlined user experience.

### OCTO Priorities 

Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience

### Veteran Journey
Reinviting Myself
- Acquiring appropriate education, new skills, and credentials

## Research Goals	
1. Understand users' experience with the VA.gov features mentioned above
2. Understand users' pain points with the VA.gov features mentioned above
3. Understand what users' would like to see improved with the VA.gov features mentioned above

### Outcome
Feedback gathered from user interviews will help the team better understand pain points and opportunities for design improvements that can be prioritized and implemented in a future release. 

### Research questions
1. What are users' general impressions and experience with VA.gov and VA education benefits
2. Where are users' stopping in the flow and why they couldn't complete their tasks
3. What features/processes would users like to see improved

### Hypothesis
We hypothesize that users will be generally happy with the objectives of our new initiatives and applaud the attempt for modernization but may call out that they do not always work as well as intended. This comes after analyzing sentiment of VA411, Medallia, and ECC data. 

Users may need a visual to jog their memory and orient them. We will provide a walkthrough before probing specific-feature questions. Based on prior data, we hypothesize users will enjoy the UI experience and simplicity of the designs. 

## Methodology	
The team will be conducting generative, open-ended interviews and will analyze qualitative findings. All interviews will be conducted in a remote, moderated setting. Participants will receive a Perigean Zoom meeting link before their session and will join the link at the beginning of the session.

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
Our intended audience for this research is for Veterans and their spouse or child who has applied for the Transfer of Entitlement application (Authenticated form 22-1990e) and have used Online Enrollment Verification and Download Education Letters features. We plan to use Perigean to support our recruitment effort using a lean maximum variation strategy. We will have dedicated notetakers on our team to help take notes. 

### Recruitment criteria
We'd like to conduct 10 feedback sessions with Veterans and their spouse or child and would ask to recruit 15 participants in case there are no-shows. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**

What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 
Target Sample Size: 1-3 participants x feature (9-10 total)
Age: Diverse distribution preferred (~40% Age 55-64+)
Accessibility Preferences:  Must have access to a computer or mobile phone to join the zoom call and view our self-guided walkthrough. Participant should indicate their preference before scheduling. 
- Note: VA has identified underrepresented demographic populations that should be prioritized for user engagement and feedback sessions.  We want to be sure to include the following Veteran groups below:
- 	Live in rural area (~25% of participants)
- 	Identify as Latinx, Biracial, Asian, Native, or LGBTQ+ (~20% of participants)
- 	Have a cognitive disability (~40% of participants)
Geographical Diversity: Diverse distribution preferred
Login Requirements: Access Zoom (as a guest) 
Familiarity with Technology: Diverse distribution preferred

**VA Benefit Usage Requirements:** Benefit usage will be an important metric for this study and must be included in the participation screener. We are seeking:

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).
