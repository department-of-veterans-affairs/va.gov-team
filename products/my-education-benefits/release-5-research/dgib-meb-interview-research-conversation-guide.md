## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. We’re working with the U.S Department of Veterans Affairs Education Service to improve the GI Bill Student experience for all users. We’re looking to understand your GI Bill experience using some features that are currently live on VA.gov, specifically Transfer of Entitlement Application, Online Enrollment Verification, and Download VA Education Letters. 
Thank you for taking time to speak with us today.

Our conversation today is going to have a light structure to ensure we address all of our learning goals, but I’d like for this to be on-going dialogue between you and I. I might interject at times to seek some clarification, but again, think of this as a conversation and not a formal interview. 

Before we get started, I’m going to read over the logistics and protocol for this interview to make sure we don’t miss anything: 

**Most importantly, you’re the expert**. We want your honest feedback: As we talk today, we want to hear your honest opinions. You are the expert about your experience, and we are here to learn from you, so there are no wrong answers. 

**Your participation is completely voluntary: ** Your time and input are extremely valued, but please know it is entirely voluntary to participate. If you don’t feel comfortable talking about anything, please let me know. If you’re not comfortable with answering a question, you’re more than welcome to pass on it. If at any point during this conversation you decide you no longer wish to participate, you may end the session for any reason.

**This entire session should take about 45 minutes to one hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally move you along to the next question or topic. 
On the consent form you acknowledged that you were comfortable with us recording this session. The recording will be used for reference in case we miss any notes. It will be deleted once our analysis is complete, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. Are you still okay with this? 

- If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 
If for any reason you want to stop the session or take a break at any point, please let me know. If there are no questions or comments at this time we can jump right in!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it’s easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
