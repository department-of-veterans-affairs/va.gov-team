**Research Plan** 


Team: Digital GI Bill (DGIB) - Human Centered Design

Project: DGIB Education Applications Usability Testing (Authenticated Forms 22-1990e, 22-1990, 22-5490)

 

**Goals**

_What product & team are you doing this research for?_

This research request comes from the Digital GI Bill team for the Veterans Benefits Administration Education Service. Digital GI Bill is modernizing the GI Bill experience through enhancing the user experience, improving claims processing, addressing the complexities of recent legislation, and integrating legacy IT systems. This research plan comes from the Human Centered Design (HCD) agile team as we seek to conduct usability testing for applications within VA education including, Transfer of Entitlement (Form 22-1990e), Montgomery GI Bill (Form 22-1990), and the Fry Scholarship & Survivors’ and Dependents’ Education Assistance (DEA, Form 22-5490). Usability testing will inform us how students understand the education application processes and how they feel about the updated designs. 


**Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?**

VA offers education benefits to Veterans, Service members, and their families. Depending on their background, an applicant will need to apply for a specific education benefit that best suits them. Currently, these applications are available for online submission through Va.Gov. The education forms that we will be testing are highlighted below: 

* Form 22-1990 allows self-entitled Veterans or Service members to apply for Montgomery GI Bill Benefits (Chapter 30 or Chapter 1606) or the Post-9/11 GI Bill Benefit.  

* Form 22-1990e is primarily for spouses or children of the Veteran or Service member - who has transferred their education benefits to them. The transfer of entitlement applicant is thus a spouse or child and applies for the Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits.  

* Form 22-5490 is the Fry/DEA application for spouses or children whose Veteran or Service member has been permanently disabled or died in the line of duty.  

Our updated applications will be available only for authenticated users (signed-in through ID.me) and will offer a streamlined application experience (pre-filled information, shortened flow with more intuitive designs, and eligibility for an instant decision).  

The design components are aligned with VA.Gov design system priorities. We have brought these designs through the VA Collaboration Cycle and completed a Design Intent & Midpoint Review for each application. Strategy for the usability testing has been approved by VA Product Owners working with the team.  

 

_Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?_

As we observe the students’ user experience as they navigate through the prototype, we hope to: 

* Understand improvements to the how to apply page entry point   

* Check to see what users understand from the language/layouts that we use 

  - Validate learn-more dropdowns are helpful for the user 

  - Visual hierarchy and visual presence of design elements are helpful for the user 

  - Validate experimental components are working for the user 

* Validate that users can successfully submit their education application 

  - Validate applicants can select and associate a Sponsor/Veteran in the application process (22-1990e/22-5490) 

  - Validate applicants understand how to select the best benefit package for them (22-1990) 

* Confirm that the flow of the education applications is logical for the user 

* Check to see if users expect more information from their education application process 

_Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?_

For students who have applied in the past, we anticipate that the updated application experience will be positive for them. New features such as benefit eligibility estimation, pre-filled fields, and the possibility of an instant decision will all enhance the user experience. When comparing to the application that they currently use, users might be more comfortable and certain of their actions throughout each step. We also believe that there will be further refinement necessary to meet the diverse needs of all users.  

 

**Method**

_What method of research are you planning?_  

The team will be conducting usability testing sessions for the updated education application prototype while tracking both qualitative and quantitative metrics. All usability testing will be conducted in a remote, moderated setting. Participants will receive a Perigean Zoom or Microsoft Teams (for participants we recruit outside of Perigean’s support) meeting link before their session and will join the link at the beginning of the session.  

_Methodology:_ 

After joining the Zoom or Microsoft Teams Meeting link, participants will receive a link to the prototype in the meeting chat. We will ask participants to navigate to the prototype link and share their screen so we can observe the participant experience. The prototype (product) that is the focus of our testing, will be presented as a series of high-fidelity visual designs that simulate three separate application processes. Users will be allocated to one of three paths for their UT session (Apply for TOE, Apply for Fry/DEA, Apply for MGIB). Participants will be given open-ended tasks to complete where they will be able to freely navigate between screens. Time metrics may be kept for certain objectives.  

_Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?_

By inviting users to participate in qualitative usability testing, the HCD team will better understand the end-to-end experience. The research is designed to elucidate specific areas for improvement within the prototype. We will be taking notes throughout the test and incorporating the Optimal Workshop software to capture data points and highlight areas for improvement within the user interface. We will leverage the feedback from our students to inform more intuitive changes. 

The quantitative measures collected during sessions will look to consider individual’s accessibility and inform us whether tasks are duplicative and time-consuming, or intuitive and simple. Updating the education applications to be simpler, more intuitive, and useful to the user is part of our Digital GI Bill goals– thus, we want to emphasize the importance of collecting both quantitative and qualitative data and ensuring quality feedback.  

 

**Participants and Recruitment** 

_Participant criteria: Primary Criteria/Must have_ - 

* Target Sample Size: 20-25 participants 

* Age: Diverse distribution preferred (~40% Age 55-64+)

* Accessibility Preferences:  Must have access to a computer or mobile phone to use the testing platform. Participant should indicate their preference before scheduling.  
 - Note: VA has identified underrepresented demographic populations that should be prioritized for user engagement and feedback sessions.  We want to be sure to include the following Veteran groups below: 
 * Live in rural area ( (~20% of participants)
 
 * Identify as Latinx, Biracial, Asian, Native, or LGBTQ+ (~20% of participants)
  
 * Have a cognitive disability (~40% of participants)

* Geographical Diversity: Diverse distribution preferred 

* Login Requirements: Access Zoom (as a guest)  

* Familiarity with Technology: Diverse distribution preferred 

* VA Benefit Usage Requirement: Benefit usage will be an important metric for this study and must be included in the participation screener. We are seeking 

  - _Category I: 1/3rd of participants to be using/have used their GI Bill benefits for themselves in the past_ 

  - _Category II: 1/3rd of participants (spouse or child to Veteran) are using/to have had benefits transferred to them from a sponsor (used 22-1990e transfer of entitlement benefits)_ 

  - _Category III: 1/3rd of participants (spouse or child to Veteran) are using/to have had benefits transferred to them from a Veteran or service member after they died in the line of duty or were permanently disabled (used 22-5490 Fry scholarship or Survivors’ and Dependents’ Education Assistance (DEA) benefits)_

Please reach out to our research team if there are any questions about subject recruitment. We recognize that these are sensitive screener questions and would like to minimize any potentially harmful or triggering questions to participants. 

 

_Potential screener questions:_

* Location of the participant and basic demographic qualifiers screeners, including: age, race, sex, state of residence (country if outside the US), accessibility 

* With respect to your GI Bill education, what degree are you working toward? (1. Associate Degree 2. Undergraduate Degree 3. Graduate Degree 3. Non-College Degree Program 4. Other. 5.None).  

* How many hours do you spend on a computer/week? (None, 1-5 hours, 5-10 hours, 10-20 hours, more than 20 hours/week).  

* How would you describe your familiarity with technology? (very poor, poor, neutral, good, very good).  

* _Benefit Screener:_ 

  - Are you currently or have you in the past used education benefits to attend school? If yes, which benefit? -- Participants that answer yes can be included under Category I.  

  - Are you currently or have you in the past been transferred benefits from a sponsor? Sometimes referred to as the Transfer of entitlement benefit? -- Participants that answer yes can be included under Category II. 

  - Are you currently or have you in the past used benefits from the Fry Scholarship or the Survivors’ and Dependents’ Education Assistance (DEA) benefits? -- Participants that answer yes can be included under Category III. 

 

_What is your recruitment strategy?_ 

Recruitment will be conducted remotely: 

 * Perigean: If approved for this research request, we would like assistance from Perigean to recruit additional students that fall under our primary participant criteria characteristics. We have conducted UT before- so we can work with them so that we don't recruit Veterans that we have already worked with through Perigean.  

* Children of Fallen Patriots Organization: A group that looks to provide college scholarships and educational counseling to military children who have lost a parent in the line of duty. We may use our existing connection to this group to include them in research, if appropriate 

 

**Timeline?** 


We plan to begin usability testing from **July 18th – August 13th**, if necessary. We are open to hosting usability testing sessions from 9am – 6pm (Est.). We will have the complete prototype built and finalized a week prior to data collection. Each UT session will span 45 – 60 minutes. Exact dates and times for testing sessions are flexible and we will coordinate with Perigean once the research request is approved. Reaching our maximum goal of participants will determine if we need to extend the data collection time window. There will be multiple pilot runs of our usability testing. We encourage VA collaboration teams to attend any of our pilot testing sessions.
