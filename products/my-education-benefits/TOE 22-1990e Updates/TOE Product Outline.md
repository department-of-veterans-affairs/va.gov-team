## Overview
Updating the 22-1990e Transfer of Entitlement (TOE) Form for Authenticated Users

## Problem Statement
Currently, the authenticated experience as a user applying for TOE benefits has to follow the same lenghty form as an unauthenticated one, with the minor perk of pre-filled contact information on file and a saved app. This is an opportunity to improve processes for over 120,000 TOE students (14% of all edu beneficiaries) that applied via the 22-1990e (data as of FY2020). As part of our greater goal to digitize the GI Bill process for all users - the My Education Benefits team is looking to improve and expedite the authenticated experience for TOE applicants. 

Thus,
**How might we improve TOE claims processing while also considering the user experience?** 

## Desired User Outcomes

- Pre-filled information on file for authenticated users, _including_ an updated method for pre-filling and selecting a sponsor that has already transferred their benefits to the applicant
- New & intuitive designs with a shortned flow that only asks the most important questions required for processing
- The ability to yield an instant decision after submitting the application for some authenticated users

## Undesired User Outcomes


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Shorter education application processing times for students so they can use their benefits promptly

- Lower workload on VCEs thanks to automation of common education benefit applications, allowing them to put resources on higher value tasks

## Undesired Business Outcomes

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
To measure the effectiveness of the application in accomplishing its objectives, we will track:

- Visitor traffic to the website
- Time spent completing each page and identify any sections that may be making aplicants spend a sizeable amount of time completing
- Abandon rate by page
- Percentage of users that complete a submission after starting an application
- Percentage of users getting an automated approval/denial letter as opposed to requiring a manual review to identify automation improvements

## Assumptions
VA.gov environment will be able to communicate with the Digital GI Bill (DGIB) services environment. DGIB environment will contain services to obtain veteran personal information, contact information, service history, TOE sponsor information, letters, and submitted applications.

## Solution Approach

*What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- Improving the 22-1990e is a part of the larger goal to modernize and digitize the GI Bill for Veterans. Now that MEB 1990 application for Post-9/11 GI Bill students is on the verge of launch, and we have brought designs for the Montgomery GI Bill benefits through the collaboration cycle, we feel it is the appropriate time to proactively start getting feedback on our TOE designs before going further. 

*What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- The updates to the 22-1990e will be primarily for authenticated users. At the current time, we want to prioritize the forms that will facilitate better claims processing and thus a more impactful experience in their education journey.  

*How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*
- Our My Education Benefits team will continue to observe other VA education edu benefit forms and see how we can best improve them.
