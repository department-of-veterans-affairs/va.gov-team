## Intro - 5 minutes
Good [morning/afternoon], may I ask what name you prefer to go by? Well, thank you for joining us today, [NAME]. My name is [NAME] and I also have some team members on the line to observe and take notes. We’re working with the U.S Department of Veterans Affairs Education Service to improve the GI Bill Student experience for all users. Today we're going to ask you to complete a series of tasks that will simulate verifying your monthly enrollments to keep getting paid through your VA (Veterans Affairs) account. 

 

Before we start, a few things I wanted to mention: 

This entire session should take about 45 minutes to one hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally move you along to the next question or topic. 

You'll be interacting with a prototype. This is a tool that may not function exactly the way you would expect a normal website to function. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. And, since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.  

Remember, you are the expert, here. In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability and there are no right or wrong answers. Your input will help us understand the communication preferences for all GI Bill Students, and we welcome your feedback. 

Please speak your thoughts aloud when going through the prototype. This helps us understand what you are thinking as you look at the designs. 

On the consent form you acknowledged that you were comfortable with us recording this session. Are you still okay with this? The recording will be used for reference in case we miss any notes. It will be deleted once our analysis is complete.  

Start recording. 

I have started recording. Can you confirm that you are okay with me recording this session? 

If for any reason you want to stop the session or take a break at any point, please let me know. If there are no questions or comments at this time we can jump right in! 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes
If you feel comfortable, could you tell us where you are from? 

Have you used education benefits before? What has been your experience so far? 

Can you share what education benefits you have right now? 

Have you had to verify your enrollments to get paid before? What have you thought about that process? 

 

So now let us click that [LINK] that you can find in the chat. It will take you to the prototype. The password is: [PASSWORD]. I am going to ask you to share your screen if possible, so please let me know if you need any assistance with that. …  
(Backup Plan – HCD (Human Centered Design) facilitator may need to share their screen to scroll/click for the participant)
