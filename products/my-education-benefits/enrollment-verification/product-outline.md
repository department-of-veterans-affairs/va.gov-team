## Overview
The Enrollment Verification application will allow participants of the GI Bill to confirm their education enrollment information monthly. Monthly enrollment confirmation is a requirement to continue receiving education payments from the GI Bill.

## Problem Statement

Making sure that a student is receiving the correct benefits while enrolled in a program is critical for overall GI Bill Program compliance, efficiency, and service delivery to veterans and their families. Today, there is no process in place online for a student to verify that the active enrollment information VA has on record is accurate.

How might we create a transparent and efficient way for veterans to review and confirm their current enrollment information that VA is using to determine the benefit they are receiving? 
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- A student required to verify their enrollment verification every month would benefit from an application that lets them:
 -  View their current enrollment information 
 -  Indicate if their enrollment information is correct or has changed on a regular basis
 -   Have clear steps on what to do or who to contact to correct any issues with their enrollment information

- With this problem solved, the student would be able to complete their required monthly enrollment verification conveniently at VA.gov, as opposed to having to call or send responses via phone texts.

## Undesired User Outcomes


## Desired Business Outcomes

- *Why would your business want this to exist?*
- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

- Higher percentage of benefits that are accurately paid each month
- Lower number of student complaints related to inaccurate payments
- Less inquiries from students on when they should expect their monthly payments
- Higher satisfaction among students with their education benefit delivery

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

- Our initial designs are targetted towards: 
    - enhancing the existing statement of benefits page to provide a clear status on whether you are up to date on your enrollment verification.
    - adding a page where a student can review and verify their enrollment information as required and view the payments that are associated with each verification

### Initiatives
*Include initiatives (iterations, new features, etc.) to improve this product. See the [Initiative Brief Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/product/initiative-brief-template.md)*
