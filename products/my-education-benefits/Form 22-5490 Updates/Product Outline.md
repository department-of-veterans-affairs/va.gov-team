## Overview
Updating the Form 22-5490 for Authenticated Users

## Problem Statement
Currently, the authenticated experience as a user applying for Fry/DEA,Ch35 benefits require  manual data entry, and no ability to receive a near-real time decision, which results in process waiting times of up to 30 days for a decision. This is an opportunity to improve processes for over the 155,000 Fry/DEA students or 18% of all edu beneficiaries (data as of FY2020). 

**How might we improve Fry/DEA claims processing while simultaneously enhancing the user experience?**
 

## Desired User Outcomes

- Pre-filled information on file for authenticated users, _including_ an updated method for pre-filling and selecting a Veteran or service member that makes the applicant eligible to their benefits
- Benefit estimations shown before applying to ensure that the user is getting best benefit for them
- New & intuitive designs with a shortned flow that only asks the most important questions required for processing
- The ability to yield a near real-time decision after submitting the application for some authenticated users

## Undesired User Outcomes


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Shorter education application processing times for applicants so they can use their benefits promptly

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
To measure the effectiveness of the application in accomplishing its objectives, we will track:

- Visitor traffic to the website
- Time spent completing each page and identify any sections that may be making aplicants spend a sizeable amount of time completing
- Abandon rate by page
- Percentage of users that complete a submission after starting an application
- Percentage of users getting an automated approval/denial decission letter as opposed to requiring a manual review to identify automation improvements

## Assumptions
-VA.gov environment will be able to communicate with the Digital GI Bill (DGIB) services environment. DGIB environment will contain services to obtain veteran personal information, contact information, service history, letters, and submitted applications.
-DGIB Services environment will be able to factor outstanding Disability, Pension, and Death records from Corp Database to properly adjudicate claims

## Solution Approach

*What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- Improving the 22-5490 is a part of the larger goal to modernize and digitize the GI Bill for Veterans, service members, and their families. 

*What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- The updates to the 22-5490 will be primarily for authenticated users. At the current time, we want to prioritize the forms that will facilitate better claims processing and thus a more impactful experience in their education journey.  

*How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*
- Our My Education Benefits team will continue to observe other VA education edu benefit forms and see how we can best improve them & add new features for active students.
