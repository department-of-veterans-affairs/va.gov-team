## Overview
The My Education Benefits application will allow applicants to submit a claim for GI Bill benefits, leveraging service data already available on VA systems to automatically determine veteran eligiblity and automatically process claims.

## Problem Statement

There are several challenges with the current education benefit application and enrollment processes. This service offering involves a number of stakeholders: Veteran Claim Examiners (VCEs), School Certifying Officials (SCOs), State Approving Agencies (SAAs), Education Liason Representatives (ELRs), additional VA staff, and of course Veterans and their families. The service involves a lot of manual data entry by all parties, a lack of clear cut guidance on the current status and next step(s) in the process, and legacy IT systems. 

How might we create a more transparent and timely process to apply for and receive education benefits for veterans and their families?
 
## Desired User Outcomes

Veterans and their families should be able to: 
- Apply for education benefits by reviewing data VA has on file for them and adjusting it, instead of providing new data that needs to be manually reviewed 
- Obtain an immediate decision about their benefit eligibility (at least for a percetnage of user base)
- Receive digital communications with status updates and documentation regarding their elgibility
- Seemlessly notify desired school(s) about their eligibility
- Stay informed of pertinent information being communicated from the school they are attending to VA


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Automation of education benefits application processing, without manual review, which should yield:
  - Shorter education application processing times for veterans so they can use their benefits promptly.
  - Lower workload on VCE's thanks to automation of common education benefit applications, allowing them to put resources on higher value tasks.

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

To measure the effectiveness of the application in accomplishing its objectives, we will track:
- Traffic to the website
- Time spent completing each page and identify any sections that may be making veterans spend a sizeable amount of time completing.
- Abandon rate by page
- Percentage of users that complete a submission after starting an application.
- Percentage of users getting an automated approval/denial letter as opposed to requiring a manual review to identify automation improvements.

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- We are starting with improving the initial eligibility application/claim processing for education benefits. There are clear improvements that can be made for veterans and their families while back end processes and systems remain largely unchanged.
- We are not including integration between the school officials application and the veteran or VCE applications with our initial build. This will be a later phase of our solution to streamline and bring additional transaparency to all stakeholders during the application and enrollment process.
