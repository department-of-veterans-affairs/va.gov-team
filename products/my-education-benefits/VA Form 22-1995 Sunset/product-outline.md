# Product Outline - VA Form 2201995 Sunset and Redirect

---

## Overview
Redirecting Veterans, service members, and dependents to one of the VBA online education application forms (22-1990, 22-1990e, 22-5490) quickly and accurately as part of VA Form 22-1995 sunsettting.

## Problem Statement
**How might we redirect Veterans, service members, and their dependents from the VA Form 22-1995 landing page the right VBA online education application forms (22-1990, 22-1990e, 22-5490) that will best fit their needs.**

**Who:** Veterans, Service Memebers, dependents.    
**What:** Redirect users to one of VA Form 22-1990, VA Form 22-1990e, or VA Form 22-5490 education applications depending on who they are and their intention for using the 22-1995.    
**Why:** VA Form 22-1995 is being sunset, users will need an alternative to method to accomplishing their goals.    
**Where:** Changes will need to be made on the 22-1995 Application Instructions page as well as the VA Form 22-1990, VA Form 22-1990e, or VA Form 22-5490 Application Instructions pages.  
 
## Desired User Outcomes

VA Form 22-1995 form will no longer be accepted by VA and thus users need an alternative way to get an updated Certificate of Eligbility (COE) or change their benefit and recieve a new COE. By leveraging users' answers, via routing tool on the 1995 Application instructions page, we can accurately redirect users to the right form based on their needs.

## Undesired User Outcomes

Frustration or confusion for users expecting to use VA Form 22-1995.

## Desired Business Outcomes
Consolidating forms and routing users effectively helps streamline the Veteran, service member, and dependent experience when using and applying for education benefits on VA.gov. 

## Undesired Business Outcomes

## Measuring Success
Leveraging KPIs available for the current VBA online education application forms - a combination of Google Analytics, VBA online education application numbers over time, and automation rates.

---

## Assumptions
We have assumptions about what the authenticated experience can pull re: information for the propsective applicant, such as last benefit used, to provide the best recommendation. 

## Solution Approach

We are going to build the routing tool that will live on the 22-1995 Application Instructions page so that users can be redirected to the right online education application form for them. The solution starts on the 22-1995 Application Instructions page since users do not need to be made aware of this update unless they are intending to use this form, users who are looking to use the 1995 form will be notified of the change via the alert banner within the application instructions page. We are proposing this as an interim solution while additional considerations are being discussed for any updates needed in existing existing forms and features to ensure all 1995 use cases are accounted for prior to the 1995 sunsetting. This solution will be part of the beginning phase for the 1995 sunsetting effort.
