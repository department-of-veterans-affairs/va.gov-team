# Product Outline - VA Form 2201995 Sunset and Redirect

---

## Overview
Redirecting Veterans, Service Members, and dependents to one of the My Education Benefits online application forms quickly and accurately as part of the 22-1995 sunsettting.

## Problem Statement
**How might we redirect Veterans, Service Members, and their dependents from the VA Form 22-1995 landing page the right My Education Benefit Online How to Apply form that will best fit their needs.**

**Who:** Veterans, Service Memebers, Dependents.    
**What:** Redirect users to one of the 22-1990, 22-1990e, or 22-5490 education applications depending on who they are and their intention for using the 22-1995.    
**Why:** VA Form 22-1995 is being sunset, users will need an alternative to method to accomplishing their goals.    
**Where:** Changes will need to be made on the 22-1995 Landing Page and Application Instructions Page as well as the 22-1990, 22-1990e, or 22-5490 Landing Pages.  
 
## Desired User Outcomes

The 22-1995 form will no longer be accepted by VA and thus users need an alternative way to get an updated Certificate of Eligbility (COE). By leveraging users' answers, via routing tool on the 1995 landing page, we can redirect users to the right form based on thier needs accurately.

## Undesired User Outcomes

Frustration or confusion for users expecting to user the 22-1995 form.

## Desired Business Outcomes
Consolidating forms and routing users effectively helps streamline the Veteran, Service Member, and dependent experience when using and applying for education benefits on VA.gov. 

## Undesired Business Outcomes

## Measuring Success
Leveraging KPIs available for the current My Education Benefits Online Forms - a combination of Google Analytics, My Education Benefits Application number over time, and automation rates.

---

## Assumptions
Leveraging the same approach from the 'How to Apply' Recommender Tool - we have assumptions about what the authenticated experience can pull re: information for the propsective applicant, such as last benefit used, to provide the best recommendation from the 1990, 1999e, and 5490 forms. 

## Solution Approach

We are going to build the routing tool that will live on the 22-1995 Landing Page so that users can be redirected to the right form for them. We decided to start our solution on this page since it will only be relevant for users looking to use the 1995 form. We are proposing this as an interim solution while additional considerations are being discussed for any updates needed in existing existing forms and features to ensure all 1995 use cases are accounted for prior to the 1995 sunsetting. This effort will be part of the beginning phase for the 1995 sunsetting. 

### Supporting research

This work does not plan to include user research. The routing tool designs leverage the 'How to Apply' Recommender Tool replacing the wizard which has gone through both the Collaboration Cycle Design Intent and Midpoint Review checkpoints, as well as usability testing. 

--- 

## Launch Strategy
- Veterans, Service Memebers, and Dependents will be notified of this change from 22-1995 Landing Page itself. Other communications are not neccessary.

## Launch Dates
- *Target Launch Date*
  - October 2025
- *Actual Launch Date* 
  - TBD
- *What date will you evaluate impact after launch (and when do you expect to have your Impact Review)?*
  - TBD
