## Overview
The My Education Benefits application will allow applicants to submit a claim for GI Bill benefits, leveraging service data already available on VA systems to automatically determine veteran eligiblity and automatically process claims.

## Problem Statement
*In a couple of sentences, describe the Who, What, Why, and Where of the challenge / pain point you seek to address. [Here's a sample problem statement definition activity you can try on your team to help generate this](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/problem-framing)*

There are several challenges with the current education benefit application and enrollment processes. This service offering involves a number of stakeholders: Veteran Claim Examiners (VCEs), School Certifying Officials (SCOs), State Approving Agencies (SAAs), Education Liason Representatives (ELRs), additional VA staff, and of course Veterans and their families. The service involves a lot of manual data entry by all parties, a lack of clear cut guidance on the current status and next step(s) in the process, and legacy IT systems. 

*Follow your problem description up with a "How might we... _______" statement re-framing that challenge as an opportunity. Don't hint too much at what the solution might be, you should have enough of a focal point here to guide your ideas, but plenty of freedom to think laterally and innovatively as you experiment and prototype later.*

How might we create a more transparent and timely process to apply for and receive education benefits for veterans and their families?
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- *Why would a user want to use this?*
- *With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
- Veterans and their families should be able to: 1) Apply for education benefits by reviewing data VA has on file for them and adjusting it, instead of providing new data that needs to be manually reviewed 2) Obtain an immediate decision about their benefit eligibility (at least for a percetnage of user base) 3) Receive digital communications with status updates and documentation regarding their elgibility 4) Seemlessly notify desired school(s) about their eligibility 5) Stay informed of pertinent information being communicated from the school they are attending to VA

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |% of automated apps |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |Processing time     |                    |        |
| KPI      |Abandon Rate |Processing time     |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

- We are starting with improving the initial eligibility application/claim processing for education benefits. There are clear improvements that can be made for veterans and their families while back end processes and systems remain largely unchanged.
- We are not including integration between the school officials application and the veteran or VCE applications with our initial build. This will be a later phase of our solution to streamline and bring additional transaparency to all stakeholders during the application and enrollment process.

### Initiatives
*Include initiatives (iterations, new features, etc.) to improve this product. See the [Initiative Brief Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/product/initiative-brief-template.md)*
