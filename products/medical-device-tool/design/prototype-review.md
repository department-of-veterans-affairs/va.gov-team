### Description
This is the default review page before submitting an order. From what we understand about these pages, they are largely boilerplate with reduced flexibility. We mostly used the standard label - data layout, but needed to display the products slightly differently in cards.

The initial focus point for this page is the H1.

## Feedback
TBD

### Description
This page shows the edit product selections states on the review page.

**Note:** When clicking the 'edit' button beside either "Add batteries to your order" or "Add accessories to your order", only their respective edit modes will open up, not necessarily both. Users _can_ enter two edit modes if they initiate both by clicking both of the edit buttons.

The initial focus point when entering this state is the "Do you need to order batteries for any of your hearing aids?" label.
