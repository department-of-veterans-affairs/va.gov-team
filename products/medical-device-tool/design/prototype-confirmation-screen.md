### Description 
The confirmation screen follows the submission of every form to both inform the veteran that their order has been submitted and to provide next steps while they wait for their order to be delivered.<br>
The initial focus point should be at the top of the page "Skip to content" link (normal, no dynamic focus management).
Once "Skip to content" is selected, the focus should be on h1: Order hearing aid batteries and accessories

### Feedback 
During an accessibility check-in, we were asked if we are going to be providing print styles for this screen. There is a separate initiative to incorporate print styles across VA.gov forms. 

### Content
**Note:** Content still needs to be reviewed by content team. Utility classes need to be reviewed by A11Y team.
