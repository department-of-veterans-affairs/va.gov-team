## C1 P2: Contact Information

The most current iteration of this screen can be found [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/medical-device-tool/design/prototype-contact-information.md).

The 1st iteration Contact Information (Address screens) allowed for one address to be passed into the frontend. The address was displayed as text input fields that were directly editable. At a meeting with the DLC on 02/27/2020 the team learned that there would need to be two addresses displayed in the UI: A _Permanent address_ and a _Temporary address_.

## Use case - Pre-filled information

### Description 
Since qualified veterans need to be logged in to place an order, the default state can be assumed to pre-fill the veteran's contact information. <br>
Initial focus point should be on the H1: _Order hearing aid batteries and accessories_

### Feedback 
**VSP Office hours in early February**
The following feedback was incorporated into the design via [this Github issue](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/5789).  
* Use either full state name or state abbreviation + state name 
* Reference: Pension form has every address field stacked
    * Some fields are shorter (such as postal code)
    * All others are same width
* Stack all the address input fields
* Input field labeling: _Street address 1_; _Street address 2_
    * Review w/ content
* Add helper text to _Street address 2_ to provide clarity about what part of the address the veteran should input 

### Content
**Note:** Content still needs to be reviewed by content team. Utility classes need to be reviewed by A11Y team.

## Use case - Updated email 

Relevant links: [Invision prototype (Desktop)](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/JVVXCA1W3GA) | [Github issue: Adding a new email address ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/5167)

### Description 
This screen shows how a veteran could add a new address or update an existing address. Since the component to capture email addresses is a text input field, the veteran would need to overwrite the current address or type a new one in the blank field.<br> 
Initial focus point: Since the Veteran is editing their email address, the focus point should be on the _email address_ text input field. This is marked using the focus management styling provided in the VA design system.

## Use case - Error handling 

Related links: [Invision prototype (Desktop)](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/CMW1O5S9ZQN) | [Github Issue](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/5791)

### Description 
This design shows an example of how error messages should be displayed in the form's UI for the _Contact information_ screen. <br><br>
Initial focus point depends on the action the user is taking. For example, if a user selects & deselects _Street address line 1_, then the focus would be on _Street address line 2_. The design team needs to double-check with the A11Y team to determine where the focus point would be if a user attempted to proceed to the next screen without completing all required fields.
