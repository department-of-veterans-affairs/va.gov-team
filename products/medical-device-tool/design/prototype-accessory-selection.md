## Description
This use case covers if a veteran does not have any accessories that are currently eligible for resupply. Additionally, the card components in this design can be applied to other combinations of eligible/ineligible accessory layouts. Even though none of the hearing aid accessories are eligible for resupply, it's important to display the items in case either a veteran is expecting to be able to order one or they don't see an expected accessory.<br/>
