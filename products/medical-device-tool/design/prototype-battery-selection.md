### Description 
This is the flow for the default state allowing the veteran to select the hearing aid(s) they would like to place batteries for. The flow contains multiple screens for various use cases. <br><br>
Note: if the veteran _only_ has hearing aids for both ears on their record, they do not need a header indicating hearing aids for both ears. However, we will need to include headers if the veteran has hearing aids for either left or right ears, or left and right ears in addition to hearing aids for both ears. 

The initial focus point per screen: <br>
**Default page, unselected** - H1 _Order hearing aid batteries and accessories_<br>
**Default page, 'no' selected** - The radio button _No, I don't need to order hearing aid batteries._<br>
**Default page, 'yes' selected, hearing aids for both ears only** - The radio button _Yes, I need to order hearing aid batteries._<br>
**Default page, 'yes' selected, mix of hearing aids** -  Since one of the cards is selected, the focus point should be on that card. We may need to provide styling references to the front-end engineers. <br>

## Use case - Select supplies (Rechargeable only)

### Description
It is possible that a veteran may only have rechargeable hearing aids on their record. There is no gating question for this use case; it is not good user experience to ask the veteran if they want to order batteries only to tell them that they cannot. However, it's important to still display the rechargeable hearing aids in case the veteran's record is not correctly updated and they expect to see a hearing aid that they can order batteries for. <br>
Initial focus point should be on the H1: _Order hearing aid batteries and accessories_.

## Description
This use case covers if a veteran does not have any devices that are currently eligible for resupply. Additionally, the card components in this design can be applied to other combinations of eligible/ineligible device layouts. Even though none of the hearing aids are eligible for resupply, it's important to display the hearing aids in case a veteran is expecting to be able to order for an aid or if they don't see an expected aid. 
Initial focus point should be on h1:  Order hearing aid batteries and accessories
