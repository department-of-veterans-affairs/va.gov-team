# Pre-Discovery Sprint, October 2019

## Design [3182](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/3182)
**Goal:** Gain a better understanding of how the ordering process currently works. Identify stakeholders' pain points on both the business and users' ends. Consolidate findings into presentation to instigate direction from stakeholders and inform future discovery sprint(s)

**Outcome:** A research readout with findings.
1. Research/Document Medical Device Ordering
2. Create preliminary user flows for device ordering
3. ~Expert evaluation of eBenefits iframe GUI~ (unable to access)
4. ~Recruit for stakeholder interview sessions/Schedule stakeholder interview sessions~ (moved to Product)
5. Create conversation guide for stakeholder interviews
6. Conduct stakeholder interviews (at a minimum the team lead, PM, and designer(s) should join these sessions).
7. ~Stakeholder Interview Synthesis - should be conducted as a team, led by designer.~ (will happen during discovery sprint)
8. Discovery Research Presentation (at minimum, it is expected that the designer should do a readout at design meetings & for their team. If stakeholder readouts are needed, the team lead/PM are responsible for scheduling those. Designers should also plan to do research readouts at the end-of-sprint demo.)

**Research questions:**
- How can we access the most up-to-date version of VA forms 2345 and 2346?   
- What are some of the problems the DALC is experiencing in regards to hearing aid / prosthetic sock ordering? 
- What are the problems you’re seeing veterans experience when ordering? 
- Do you currently keep analytics on how orders are placed? 
- What risks or problems do you see us facing during this project?
- Are there any other medical devices that have demand high enough for inclusion? 
- Is there anyone else you think we should talk to about this project? 


## Engineering [3071]( https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/3071)
**Goal:** To investigate and document the current Medical Device tool 
1. **front-end architecture**
- Including data sources and any transformations or mappings of those data.

2. **back-end architecture** 
- Including data sources and any transformations or mappings of those data.


**Outcome:**
 A diagram of the process with database and endpoints mapped out

**Research questions:**
1. What data is needed so that the user can complete the process?
2. Where is the database the information is stored on?
3. Identify the service or stack that may house the endpoints?
4. Define those endpoints and discuss with other team members?

## Product [2319](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vft-59c95ae5fda7577a9b3184f8/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/2319)
**Goal:** To investigate and document the current Medical Device Tool
1. Determine Stakeholders 
2. Determine the Users
3. Google Analytics reports on the tool's current usage and legacy systems.

**Outcome:** A discovery readout that documents findings and recommendations.
