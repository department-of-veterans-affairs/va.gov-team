## Introduction
_(About 5 minutes)_

Thank you for joining us today! My name is ______. I am a designer and researcher for VA.gov and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Our team is working on an ordering tool for prosthetic socks and hearing aid batteries. Today we're going to talk about your experience with the DLC and how Veterans order medical devices.

Before we start, I want to mention a few things:

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.
