_When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro:_

Thank you for joining us today! My name is ______. I am a designer and researcher for VA.gov and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your experience ordering hearing aid batteries through the VA.

Before we start, I want to mention a few things:

This entire session should take about 45 minutes I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. So please let us know what you think, and any ideas on how we can improve this process for you. We are not testing your abilities or knowledge in any way. We want to improve the hearing aid battery ordering process to better meet Veteran’s needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.
