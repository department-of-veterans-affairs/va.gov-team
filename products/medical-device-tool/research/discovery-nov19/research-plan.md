# Research Plan for BAM2, Medical Device Tool, November 2019
(This should be filled out and maintained by the designer on the team & can be cross-linked and referenced in any issues.) 

## Goals
1. What product & team are you doing this research for? <br>
**Benefits & Memorials 2**
2. Background: <br>
**This product is a migration and modernization of the hearing aid battery and prosthetic sock ordering functionality that currently exists as an iframed applet on eBenefits. With eBenefits being sunsetted and the DLC’s interest in increasing adoption of online ordering to reduce contact center workload, we’re tasked with designing a new online ordering experience that will be simpler for Vets and less overhead for the DLC.**
3. Research questions:
    - Why do Veterans choose one ordering method over the other?
      - Are they consistently using the same methods? Why change?
      - Why is the online method underutilized by Veterans?
      - Is there significant interest in ordering through VA.gov?
    - What pain points are Veterans experiencing when ordering resupply items today?
    - What resupply needs do Veterans have that are not being filled currently?
    - What is the average timeframe it takes for an order to be received? 
    - How do Veterans feel about any communication(s) once their order is submitted?
    - When online ordering is launched, how do Veterans expect to learn about it?
    - Are Veterans the ones initializing reorders? If not, who?  
    - Are Veterans returning orders? If so, how do they feel about that process? 

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 
    - Veterans are avoidant of the online form because it’s difficult for them to sign in (from conversation with DLC IT Stakeholder)
    - Veterans don’t always know item details for their order
    - Veterans would like more visibility into their orders
    - Veterans would like to automate their orders more
    - Veterans would like to be able to track their orders


## Method
1.	What method of research are you planning? <br>
**60-minute remote, directed interviews with Veterans who order hearing aid batteries and/or prosthetic socks**
  
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? <br>
**This is the easiest way to talk with Veterans about their experience with the ordering process since our team does not have access to the current ordering systems. There are a variety of ways a Veteran can order, including live agent phone lines, automated phone line, paper form, online form, and through their VHA provider - therefore, we will need to branch our line of questioning depending on the Veteran’s preferred ordering method(s).**

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? <br>
**Online, via Zoom.**

4.	What will you be testing? <br> 
**We will not be testing any deliverables directly.**

## Participants and Recruitment
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?
    - **8 Veterans who order hearing aid batteries through the VA**
      - 4 pre-9/11 Veterans
      - 4 post-9/11 Veterans
      - Include a mix of Veterans with a disability rating of 80% or higher
      - If possible, 1-2 Veterans who have a cochlear implant
    - **8 Veterans who order prosthetic socks through the VA**
      - 4 pre-9/11 Veterans with amputations
      - 4 post-9/11 Veterans with amputations
      - Include a mix of amputation types (feet, legs, arms, hips), if possible
      - Include a mix of Veterans with a disability rating of 80% or higher

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? <br>
**We plan to leverage Perigean to recruit Veterans to this study.**

**December 2nd, 2019 - December 6th, 2019**

2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? <br> 
**No dependencies, interview only**

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? <br>
