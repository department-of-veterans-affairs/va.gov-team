Introduction
------------

*(About 5 minutes)*

Thank you for joining us today! My name is ______, and I'm a designer and researcher for VA.gov. I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes for me. Today we're going to be testing a new way for Veterans to order hearing aid batteries and accessories online. During this test, I will ask you to share your screen so that I can follow along with you.

Before we start, I want to mention a few things about this session:

-   This entire session should take about 45 minutes; I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

-   In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. So please let us know what you think, and any ideas on how we can improve this process for you. We are not testing your abilities or knowledge in any way. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

-   You'll be interacting with a prototype during this session. This means that you will be interacting with a replica of VA.gov, but some areas may be clickable while others aren't. None of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

-   If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

-   Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start recording.*
