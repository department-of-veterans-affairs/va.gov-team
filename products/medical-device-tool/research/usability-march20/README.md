- Research Plan Feedback
  - Shawna's Feedback
    - After sharing our original conversation guide, Shawna recommended that we eliminate (or at least reduce) interrupting the participants mid-task to ask questions. We reworked the guide to allow a more natural progression through the tasks and placed "side-quest" tasks at the end once the main flow has been followed.
