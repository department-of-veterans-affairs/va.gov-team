## Preliminary Product Research
_Timeline: Oct 23 - Nov 20_

This research was conducted to help clarify the current state of the problem space and form a common understanding in the BAM2 and DSVA Teams. This research was deemed necessary to understand this problem space and identify potential stakeholder groups for kickoff. During this time, we investigated publicly-available knowledge about the ordering process as it exists today and the each of the disabilities the devices aid with.

## Discovery Sprint, November 2019
_Timeline: Nov 20 - December 18_

This research is to bring stakeholder and SME knowledge into the mix as well as gain insights into our users directly. The outcome of this research should be a solid understanding of the business and user problems that exist so that we can build an informed prototype.

- Research Plan Feedback
  - Shawna's Feedback
    - After sharing our original conversation guide, Shawna recommended that we eliminate (or at least reduce) interrupting the participants mid-task to ask questions. We reworked the guide to allow a more natural progression through the tasks and placed "side-quest" tasks at the end once the main flow has been followed.
