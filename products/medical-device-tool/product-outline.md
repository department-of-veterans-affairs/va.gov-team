# Executive Summary

### User Problem Statement
As an eligible Veteran, I would like to be able to receive hearing aid battery and/or accessory resupply online so I don't need to contact the Denver Logistics Center (DLC) to place an order.

### Solution Goals
Provide Veterans eligible for hearing aid battery and/or accessory resupply a user experience that allow them to order available items through an end-to-end online ordering process. 

### Minimal Viable Product (MVP)
Medical Device Tool features: 
- Veteran's personal information - login and authenticate with Vet360 API
> Name, Address, Email is prepopulated in the personal information forms.
- Clear instructions on how to edit veterans personal information, if it is incorrect
- Pull in reorder data using Reorder API so Veterans can see products eligible for resupply, reorder eligibility dates, and item quantities.
> Hearing aid batteries
> Hearing aid accessories
- Review submission page
> Display the Veteran's contact information & items ordered
- Status of order

### User Goals
Implement a modernized ordering process using the VA.gov form's system that will allow the Veteran to quickly select the items available for resupply and submit an order. 

### Business Goals
DLC
-	Migration of orders from other offered channels to the online channel. 
-	Currently the online channel is used by 7,000 Veterans per month. The other ordering channels are IvR, direct email, contact center and reorder forms account for 180,000 per month.
-The business goal is to migrate Veterans from channels that have a high cost per order to online self service channel. 
-A QoQ migration of 5% to online channel would be considered a huge win.

-Primary Objectives:
> - Transition hearing aid battery resupply ordering from eBenefits to VA.gov
> - Add online resupply request capability for common hearing aid accessories
> - Minimize need for Veteran data entry in online channel. Personal information adn reorder information is prefilled for the Veteran. 
> - Maximize DLC processing of requests via online channel

-Secondary Objectives:
> - Include features to ensure correct delivery address for products being shipped. The Vet can edit delivery address online. 

VA
-	Migrate DLC's medical device ordering tool from eBenefits to Va.gov

## Assumptions
- The low number of online orders is a result of Veterans finding it difficult to log into eBenefits because of additional authentication requirements. 
- Veterans use other channels to reorder their items because the online channel is both difficult and confusing to use.
- Veterans who are able to log into eBenefits do not place orders online due to being unable to order hearing aid accessories. 

## Requirements and Constraints
### Requirements- 
-	Access to Vets API for user authentication, personal information
- DLC to develop API to provide catalog information, reorder eligibility and reorder dates.
-	Development environment compatible with VA standards

### Constraints- 
-	Lack of access to DLC’s data. 
-	DLC resources and time to update their system. Currently the DLC will have to build their own API.

## Discovery Takeaways

## Value Propositions
Team will utilize shared resources to include, but not limited to: Front End engineer, Editors, content review, IA, 508, and local PAO input.

#### User Value
Being able to order all available hearing aid battery and accessory items through an online ordering system instead of experiencing potential wait times while placing an order through the DLC's contact center or wondering if a sent mail-in order card has been processed.

#### Business Value
Increase customer satisfaction
-	By fulling Veterans desire to reorder medical supplies online instead of calling contact center or sending mail-in order cards.
-	Reducing number of both mail-in order cards and contact center calls to decrease the DLC's operating costs.
-	The opportunity to increase focus on a Veteran's needs because the volume of contact center calls will be reduced.
