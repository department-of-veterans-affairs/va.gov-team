# Executive Summary

### User Problem Statement
As a Veteran, who is eligible to re-order hearing aid batteries and accesories from the Denver Logistics Center (DLC), I would like to be able to see what items I can reorder on line and the date I am eligible ro reorder on-line without having to call or email the support center. As the DLC, I would like to migrate more users to online self service reordering system to decrease call center volume, mail in cards and reduce costs.

### Solution Goals
Improve the overall reordering experience for Veterans by increasing the number of medical items offered through Denver Logistic Center's (DLC) online ordering system and makign the user experience easy and intuitive.

### Minimal Viable Product (MVP)
Medical Device Tool features: 
- Veteran's personal information - login and authenticate with Vet360 API
> Name, Address, Email is prepopulated in the personal information forms.
- Clear instructions on how to edit veterans personal information, if it is incorrect
- Pull in reorder data using Reorder API so vets can see what productsthey are aligible to to reorder and eligibility dates and quantaties.
> Hearing aid batteries
> Hearing aid accessories
- Confirmation page
> list out veteran contact information & items ordered
- Status of order

### User Goals
Streamline the Veterans ordering process by:
1. Be able to complete a full order through the online ordering system. 
2. Modernizes their ordering process to reduce efforts 
-	_Currently eBenefits only offers reordering Hearing aids batteries and prosthetic socks._

### Business Goals
DLC
-	Migration of orders from other offered channels to the online channel. 
-	Currently the online channel is used by 7,000 veterans per month. Other channels are IvR, direct email, call center and reorder forms account for 180,000 per month.
-The business goal is to migrate veterals from channels that have a high cost per order to online self service channel. 
-A QoQ migration of 5% to online channel would be considered a huge win.

-Primary Objectives:
> - Transition hearing aid battery resupply ordering from eBenefits to VA.gov
> - Add online resupply request capability for common hearing aid accessories
> - Minimize need for Veteran data entry in online channel. Personal information adn reorder information is prefilled for the Vets. 
> - Maximize DLC processing of requests via online channel

-Secondary Objectives:
> - Include features to ensure correct delivery address for products being shipped. The Vet can edit deliviry address on-line. 

VA
-	Migrate DLC's medical device ordering tool from eBenefits to Va.gov

## Assumptions
- The low online orders are a result of Veterans finding it difficult to log into the eBenefits because of its additional authentication requirements. 
- Veterans use other channels to reorder their items because the online channel is difficult and confusing to use.

## Requirements and Constraints
### Requirements- 
-	Access to Vets API for user authentication, personal information
- DLC to develop API to provide catalog information, reorder eligibility and reorder dates.
-	Development environment compatible with VA standards

### Constraints- 
-	Lack of access to DLC’s data. 
-	DLC resources and time to update their system. Currently the DLC will have to build their own API.
