## Overview
The platform needs a proper performance monitoring process for the website to ensure we have standardized ways to measure, evaluate and govern pefromance so that we can promote valuable improvements and ensure stability.

## Problem Statement
*In a couple of sentences, describe the Who, What, Why, and Where of the challenge / pain point you seek to address. [Here's a sample problem statement definition activity you can try on your team to help generate this](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/problem-framing)*

*Follow your problem description up with a "How might we... _______" statement re-framing that challenge as an opportunity. Don't hint too much at what the solution might be, you should have enough of a focal point here to guide your ideas, but plenty of freedom to think laterally and innovatively as you experiment and prototype later.*
 
## User Goals

- *Why would a user want to use this?*
- *With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
