Provide automated tooling to automate to improve code quality with explicit and enforced standards to help reduce the burden of code reviews felt by both VFS and VSP Teams.

## Tools Implemented:
**ESLint** - Establish a standard set of linting rules using 'eslint' that will be run during every build and report any warnings or errors to VFS Teams 

**Manual Review Triggers** - Each PR on vets-website will run through an automated process which looks for code additions/modifications which could be considered bad for the platform. If a potential issue is found, a bot will leave an automated comment and request a review from the frontend-review-group.
