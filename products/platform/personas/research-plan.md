# Research Plan for Platypus Platform Team: Discovery for Platform Personas, January 2019

## Goals
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?
  - The purpose of this discovery research is to form the basis for building personas for the users of the Veteran-facing Services Platform.
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?
  - The Veteran-facing Services Platform (VSP) is the method/process by which VA can scale its capacity for building new, high-quality, digital applications and services for Veterans. This research will help us understand the experiences of the external teams that build on the VSP, and the internal teams that support them. We will use it to create more complete and useful services, checkpoints, and documentation, and reduce the friction and challenges that come with building and launching digital products. 
3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?
  - What challenges do teams at various stages of the project?
  - How do teams feel at various stages of the project?
  - What steps do teams take to find answers to questions?
  - What do teams learn during the course of their project?
    
4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?
  - There will be a variety of experience and comfort level with agile methodology
  - The amount of documentation is overwhelming, it's hard to find things
  - It's hard for internal teams to strike the right balance of support and control
  
## Method
1.	What method of research are you planning?
Remote, directed interviews. 
  
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?
Because this is discovery research and largely qualitative, directed interviews will provide opportunites for participants to share stories about their experiences.

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? 
JoinMe using audio only, with recordings if the participant consents.

4.	What will you be testing?
There is no prototype to test, but we'll be having a guided conversation.

## Participants and Recruitment
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?
- Product managers, engineers, and designers from internal teams who have collaborated or supported in some way an external team building on the VFS platform.
- Product managers, engineers, and designers from external teams who have built an app or service on the VFS platform.
2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 
- Scheduling time with internal team members as their schedules allow
- Getting recommendations and introductions to external teams from internal/DSVA folks when appropriate

## When? 
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 
January 28-Feb 1

2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 
As soon as the conversation guide and research plan are approved.

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be?
30 minutes

4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? 
Sessions will be scheduled as calendars allow. I will work directly with the participants to schedule session times.

5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 
TBD
