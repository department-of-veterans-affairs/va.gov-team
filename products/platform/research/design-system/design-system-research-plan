# Research Plan for [Design System, Nov, 2020]

## Goals	
1. What product [tool/service/document/process] & VSP team are you doing this research for? Design System
	
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? Link to the product outline.
The Design System team is just getting started and we want to conduct generative research to learn where to best focus efforts in Q1 2021.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 
We hope to learn what things are slowing VFS teams down when using the design system.
- is it the number of components available in the design system?
- is it knowing the process to follow for when the available components don't fit your needs?
- is it understanding how to start building a form?
- is it finding documentation on how to customize components in the design system?


4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	


## Method	
What method of research are you planning? 	
Sample Methodologies: Directed interviews; ethnographic interviews; contextual inquiry; card sorts; tree tests; guerilla usability testing; usability testing with low- or high-fidelity prototypes;
Also mention: in-person moderated, remote moderated, remote unmoderated

  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (Zoom, GoToMeeting, etc.)*	
4.	What will you be testing? *(Tool, process, design, documentation, etc. Provide links if possible.)* 	

## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	
(Mention: Number of participants, practice areas, VFS team, VFS product. Please keep in mind that we have a limited number of VFS teams, and we should avoid going to the same people and teams back-to-back.)
2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
(Usually it is a Slack message directly to the team or team members. Contact the Design Lead if you need help getting in touch with anyone.)	
## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
(Schedule your research at least 1 week in advance if possible to give your participants time to organize their calendars) 	
2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	
3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours) 	
4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Keep in mind that VFS team members are also remote and live in different time zones. Try and keep research sessions during normal working hours.	
5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	

## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need help finding someone to take notes for you, contact the Design Lead** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work**
