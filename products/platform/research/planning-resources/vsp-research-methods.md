## I want to build a greater understanding of the problem and the people it impacts

Use these methods to build context for the problem you’re investigating. Get to know your potential users better and understand your stakeholders’ main concerns. The work you do during this phase will inform everything that follows, so take your time.


### Methods



#### 1. User Interviews


##### What

A wide-spanning set of semi-structured interviews with anyone who has an interest in a project’s success, including users. Conduct user interviews with the goal of identifying user goals, behaviors and pain points


##### Why

To build consensus about the problem statement and research objectives.


##### How to do it



*   [GUIDE: User interviews - 18F Methods](https://methods.18f.gov/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/)
*   [How to conduct a user interview](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-interviews/?lm=interviewing-users&pt=article)

 


#### 2. Contextual Inquiry


##### What

The product team unobtrusively observes participants at work, with their permission, then asks questions.


##### Why

To learn how and why users do what they do; to discover needs and attitudes that might not emerge in an [interview](https://methods.18f.gov/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/) to map how tools, digital and otherwise, interact during complex activities.


##### How to do it



*   [GUIDE: Contextual inquiry - 18F Methods](https://methods.18f.gov/discover/contextual-inquiry/)

 


#### 3. Good Services Scale


##### What

Assess the quality of your service using the[ 15 Principles of Good Service Design](https://good.services/15-principles-of-good-service-design)


##### Why

To help you and your team understand how well your service is performing for your users, where it needs to be improved, and build a clear a plan to improve it


##### How to do it



*   [TEMPLATE: Good Services Scale](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hr_n-c30knHcvpHxsXLdeYPc4eLsrGshd0q7zzMgwH0/edit?usp=sharing)

 


#### 4. Five Whys


##### What

An iterative process for identifying the root cause of a problem by posing the question “Why?” at least five times to help separate symptoms from causes.


##### Why

To identify the root cause(s) of an issue or problem.


##### How to do it



*   [GUIDE: Five whys - 18F Methods](https://methods.18f.gov/discover/five-whys/)

 


#### 5. Qualitative Survey


##### What

A qualitative survey is a survey where open ended questions are asked and gathered with long form text answers.


##### Why

To quickly get an idea of where the pain points are from a broad set of users, but can be more involved for the user to complete as they are mostly open-ended questions.


##### How to do it



*   [GUIDE: Qualitative surveys](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/qualitative-surveys/) (placeholder - N/Ng)

 


#### 6. Design Sprint


##### What

A Design Sprint is a method for solving problems through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users in 1 week. 


##### Why

To quickly align teams under a shared vision with clearly defined goals and deliverables.


##### How to do it



*   TEMPLATE: Remote Design Sprint
*   [EXAMPLE: VSP Discovery Readout](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mESrMGEn5nGG9M0HUIkoBfIUCtk9ZrdV7FkMsWOH4XE/edit#slide=id.g763817838a_0_0)

## I want to elaborate on research from our discovery research

These methods help you derive insights from the information gathered during discovery research. You’ll validate initial assumptions, develop a deeper understanding of workflows and processes, and develop design hypotheses.


### Methods

 



#### 1. Affinity Mapping


##### What

A way of finding themes in collections of ideas, quotes, or observations.


##### Why

To draw out insights from qualitative data quickly and collaboratively.


##### How to do it



*   [GUIDE: Affinity mapping - 18F Methods](https://methods.18f.gov/decide/affinity-mapping/)
*   [GUIDE: Synthesize your research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19pqV57hCks9H0nxsblOkqnKkVuccsNUgzUQ-i-yXr2k/edit#slide=id.ga451cd5172_0_96)


#### 2. Content Audit


##### What

A listing and analysis of all the content on an existing website (including pages, files, videos, audio or other data) that your users might reasonably encounter.


##### Why

To identify content that needs to be revised in new versions of a website. Content audits can also help you identify who is responsible for content, how often it should be updated, and what role a particular piece of content plays for users.


##### How to do it



*   [GUIDE: Content audit - 18F Methods](https://methods.18f.gov/decide/content-audit/)

 

3. Task Flow Analysis


##### What

A step-by-step analysis of how a user will interact with a system in order to reach a goal. This analysis is documented in a diagram that traces a user’s possible paths through sequences of tasks and decision points in pursuit of their goal. The tasks and decision points should represent steps taken by the user, as well as steps taken by the system.


##### Why

If user interviews have already been done, you might be ready to analyze user tasks to find ways to save people time and effort. Task flow analysis is used to validate a design team’s understanding of users’ goals, common scenarios, and tasks, and to illustrate in a solution-agnostic way the overall flow of tasks through which a user progresses to accomplish a goal. Task flow diagrams also help surface obstacles in the way of users achieving their goal.


##### How to do it



*   [GUIDE: Task flow analysis - 18F Methods](https://methods.18f.gov/decide/task-flow-analysis/)
*   EXAMPLE

 


#### 4. Personas


##### What

User archetypes based on conversations with real people.


##### Why

To ground design in reality by forcing us to consider the goals, behaviors, and pain points of the people affected by our design decisions. Unlike marketing personas based on demographics or marketability, design personas describe how someone accomplishes goals.


##### How to do it



*   [GUIDE: Personas - 18F Methods](https://methods.18f.gov/decide/personas/)
*   [EXAMPLE: Personas](https://github.com/18F/federalist-design/wiki/Personas)

 


#### 5. Journey Mapping


##### What

A visualization of the major interactions shaping a user’s experience of a product or service.


##### Why

To provide design teams with a bird’s-eye view of a service that helps them see the sequence of interactions that make up a user’s experience including the complexity, successes, pain points, and emotions users experience from the earliest phases of researching a product or service all the way through adoption.


##### How to do it



*   GUIDE: Journey mapping - 18F Methods
*   EXAMPLE: Journey Map

 


#### 6. Storyboarding


##### What

A visual sequence of a specific use case or scenario, coupled with a narrative.


##### Why

To visualize interactions and relationships that might exist between a user and a solution in the context of the user’s full experience.


##### How to do it



*   [GUIDE: Storyboarding - 18F Methods](https://methods.18f.gov/decide/storyboarding/)

 


#### 7. User Scenarios


##### What

A method for telling a story about a user’s interaction with your product, service, or website, focusing on the what, how, and why.


##### Why

To communicate a design idea by telling a story about a specific interaction for a specific user. Through creating user scenarios, you’ll identify what the user’s motivations are for using your product, service, or website, as well as their expectations and goals. User scenarios help teams consider both how the same user’s needs might vary depending on their context and how a diverse group of users in the same scenario might have different needs. By constructing user scenarios, you can help the team answer questions about how accessible, inclusive, and adaptive your product, service, or website is.


##### How to do it



*   [GUIDE: User scenarios - 18F Methods](https://methods.18f.gov/decide/user-scenarios/)

 


#### 8. Mental Modeling


##### What

A simple reference model that correlates existing and potential interfaces with user behaviors.


##### Why

To help designers anticipate how design decisions might facilitate future behaviors.


##### How to do it



*   [GUIDE: Mental modeling - 18F Methods](https://methods.18f.gov/decide/mental-modeling/)

 


#### 9. Design Principles


##### What

Written statements, generally in the form of imperatives like “Earn people’s trust,” that serve as guiding lights during decision-making.


##### Why

To give the team and the stakeholders a shared point of reference when negotiating next steps. Good design principles are specific to the project, not general truths, and should help teams say “no” to otherwise interesting proposals or generate ideas when they’re stuck.


##### How to do it



*   [GUIDE: Design principles - 18F Methods](https://methods.18f.gov/decide/design-principles/)

 


#### 10. Design Hypothesis


##### What

Framing your work as a hypothesis means no longer just thinking about the thing you’re making or building, but paying more attention to whether that work is achieving your intended goals and outcomes.


##### Why

When done collaboratively, hypothesis-building is powerful at getting a team on the same page about what it’s doing and why. It also allows the team to be flexible — if one approach doesn’t result in the outcome you expected, you have implicit permission to change course and try something else.


##### How to do it



*   [GUIDE: Design Hypothesis - 18F Methods](https://methods.18f.gov/decide/design-hypothesis/)

## I want to create a testable solution

Once you’ve learned more about your users’ expectations, use any of these methods to create testable designs. Sketching, wireframing, and prototyping will help you ensure your product reflects your users’ needs.


### Methods



#### 1. Prototyping


##### What

A rudimentary version, either static or functional, of something that exhibits realistic form and function.


##### Why

To enable direct examination of a design concept’s viability with a number of other methods such as [usability testing](https://methods.18f.gov/validate/usability-testing/#usability-testing) or a [cognitive walkthrough](https://methods.18f.gov/discover/cognitive-walkthrough/#cognitive-walkthrough). Static prototypes (often paper) are helpful for gaining feedback on users’ intentions and various design elements. Functional prototypes (often coded) are helpful for observing how users interact with the product.


##### How to do it

## I want to test our design hypothesis

Testing (and re-testing) your designs with users will help you build the best possible product. These methods cover varied testing scenarios and potential user groups.


### Methods


#### Card Sorting


##### What \
A categorization exercise in which participants divide concepts into different groups based on their understanding of those concepts. \



##### Why \
To gain insights from users about how to organize content in an intuitive way. \
How to do it

*   [GUIDE: Card Sorting - 18F Methods](https://methods.18f.gov/validate/card-sorting/)




#### 2. Usability Testing


##### What

Observing users as they attempt to use a product or service while thinking out loud.


##### Why

To better understand how intuitive the team’s design is, and how adaptable it is to meeting user needs.
