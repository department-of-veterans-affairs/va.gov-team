## Why do we do research on VSP?

We should be conducting user research as part of the product development process on VSP to help guide our product decisions. This means discovery research as well as usability testing or other methods to make sure the things weâ€™re making are working for those that will be using it. The [Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play1) states that "We need to continually test the products we build with real people to keep us honest about what is important." This approach is often refered to as human-centered design.

Human-centered design is a methodology that incorporates feedback from the people (users) who will use the tool, document or process that you are designing for them. The goal of human-centered design is to end up with a solution that is tailored to meet your users needs, with little wasted effort and reduced risk. 

To achieve this goal, all teams on VSP will talk with and observe their users to understand their needs, context, and challenges, come up with design concepts that might address these challenges, and then test them with users. Find more resources on human-centered design in government at [digital.gov](https://digital.gov/topics/design/).


## What type of research should I do?

Understanding what you want to learn from your research can help you choose the method that works best for your initiative.[ Find the research method to suit your needs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/research/planning-resources/vsp-research-methods.md).


## What's involved in doing research?

For an overview of how to conduct research, you can read[ how to do user research for VSP](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/research/planning-resources/how-vsp-does-research.md).
