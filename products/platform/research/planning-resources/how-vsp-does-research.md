We should be conducting user research as part of the product development process on VSP to help guide our product decisions. This means discovery research as well as usability testing or other methods to make sure the things we’re making are working for those that will be using it.


## Who are the users of the Platform?

The audience for the Platform is _not_ Veterans. We are designing for:



*   VFS teams (product managers, engineers, designers, content writers, QA specialists, accessibility specialists, researchers)
*   Dependent/Platform-adjacent teams (CMS, Lighthouse)
*   OCTODE product owners

Because we support and collaborate with them daily, it can be easy to forget that they are our users.

There are a few exceptions to this group of users (Identity team, Contact Center team, some of the Product Support team's work). Reach out to the design leads if you need a hand figuring out who exactly your audience is.


## User research process

DEPO has written up a [process for doing research with Veterans](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/research-process.md), but there are some different details to consider for doing research with VFS teams, which will be outlined in this document.



*   Make a plan
*   Recruit participants
*   Conduct sessions
*   Synthesize data
*   Read out results


### 1. Make a plan



---



#### Get organized

Create a folder in the relevant product directory to house the research documents. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/orientation/repo-guidelines.md#naming-conventions) for naming your files and folders in Github.

Put all project-related research in this folder, including:



*   Research plan
*   Conversation guide
*   Session notes
*   Synthesis
*   Readout

Create a research epic to track the work in Zenhub. Tag Andrea Chappelear, Naomi Marcussen on the epic for awareness.




#### Write a research plan

Filling out the research plan will guide you through decisions about your research:



*   What are your goals?
*   What methodology will you use? (More on that below.)
*   Who do you want to talk to?
*   What is your timing?
*   Who will do what during the sessions?

If you have a designer on your team, they should fill out this plan.

Copy the [VSP Research Plan template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/research/planning-resources/vsp-research-plan-template.md) into a new markdown file in your research folder and answer all the questions. If you need help making any decisions, reach out to Naomi.




#### Choosing a method

Defining your research goals (as you write your research plan) will help you select a method (or a combination of them). In order to answer your research questions, you’ll need to get information somehow, but how? And what kind of information?




#### Are you looking to...



*   build a greater understanding of the problem and the people it impacts
*   elaborate on research from our discovery research.
*   create a testable solution
*   create a testable solution
*   test our design hypothesis
*   get ongoing feedback on our product post-launch

[Discover research methods](https://vfs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~227693187/pages/997326849/VSP+Research+Methods) to help you answer your questions.




#### Write a conversation guide

Once you’ve filled out your research plan, write a conversation guide. Use the [VSP Conversation Guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/research/planning-resources/vsp-conversation-guide-template.md) template as a starting place. Whoever the moderator will be should generally write the conversation guide. (If you have a designer on your team, they should usually be the moderator.)

A conversation guide is a script that organizes how you’d like each user research session to go. The moderator should plan to use it during each session and read directly from it. Feel free to go off-script and follow the natural flow of the conversation.

These are most commonly used in synchronous research sessions, but can be adapted as a set of instructions to be given to the user asynchronously if necessary.


#### Pro tips:



*   When drafting questions, write down every question you can think of and get input from all team members. Organize later.
*   When organizing, start with high level and general questions, then get more specific
*   Always begin with an intro that sets the stage of the project and session (start with the intro included in the template)

Once you’ve drafted your research plan and conversation guide, work with Naomi to review and conduct a pilot run through to work out the kinks.


### 2. Recruit participants



---


For moderated interviews or usability tests, you’ll want to recruit 6 - 8 people. For other methods like tree tests you’ll want as many as you can get.




#### Identify participants

Create a spreadsheet of potential participants, and include the following information about each person:



*   Name
*   Team
*   Role
*   Slack name
*   Email address
*   Contacted? (Yes/no)
*   Accepted? (Yes/no)
*   Date scheduled

If your users are VFS team members, you can refer to the [team list in Atlas](https://www.va.gov/atlas/product_directory/team_members) to find up-to-date list of VFS teams. If your users are Veterans, please reach out to Lauren Alexanderson to review your research plan, conversation guide and help recruit Veterans.




#### Draft your recruiting message

If you are recruiting VFS team members yourself, you’ve already decided who your users are in your research plan. Now it’s time to reach out to them. Use the following as a template to write your message:

_Hey [First name]! I’m working with the [Team name] team on VSP to better understand [research subject]. We’re hoping to set up [X]-minute meetings with folks to [hear what that process is like/evaluate X tool/document], what works well, what doesn’t, etc. — is this something you’ve had experience with and if so, would you be willing to chat about it with us?_




#### Decide communication channels



*   Send your recruiting message via Slack DM to people who fit your criteria _(this is the most effective method)_
*   Large Slack channels:
    *   #vfs-all-teams
    *   #vfs-platform-support
*   Practice area-specific Slack channels
*   Team or contract-specific Slack channels
*   Make a recruiting announcement in Team of Teams
*   Ask PMs of VFS teams to ask their team members to participate
*   Ask DEPO to send your recruiting message on your behalf




#### Schedule sessions



*   Aim to schedule 25% more participants than you actually need (in case of last minute cancelations)
*   Recruit your participants at least 1 week before you plan to begin sessions
*   Keep in mind they have busy schedules too — work around their availability as much as possible
    *   If you can see their calendar, use that to find availability
    *   Use Slack to find a time that works for everyone
*   Send a calendar invite to the participant, notetaker, observers, and any other stakeholders who may want to attend
    *   Think about what people on VSP this research might impact, or might be useful for, and invite them to observe
*   Invite Naomi and the Service Design team as optional for awareness




### 3. Conduct sessions



---



#### Do a dry run with your team



*   If you are testing a thing, make sure the thing is ready before your dry run.
*   Schedule the dry run at least 2 days before the first session with participants is scheduled
*   Treat the dry run like the real thing
*   Have a team member play role of “participant”
*   Have team members observe
*   Whoever the moderator will be for the live sessions should moderate the dry run
*   Record the dry run
*   Debrief after
    *   What went well?
    *   What changes do you want to make before sessions with participants begin?




#### Run the research sessions

Do the thing you set out to do in your research plan.

Moderated, synchronous sessions



*   Use the conversation guide to moderate your sessions (if the method you chose allows)
*   Make sure a notetaker has been designated for each session
*   Make sure the notes get uploaded to Github (or whatever shared space you’re using) that day
*   Record the sessions

Unmoderated, asynchronous sessions



*   Provide instructions and relevant links to your participants
*   Make yourself available if participants have questions
*   Send out reminders to participants to give their input (use a variety of communication channels)
*   Specify a date that the study will close

    Research doesn’t end when the last session is over.





### 4. Synthesize data



---


The Service Design team is here to help with this part. They can help facilitate workshops to help you synthesize all your findings and connect the dots. Drop a note in the #service-design channel to schedule a synthesis session.




#### Synthesis process

Make sense of what you learned! Involve the whole team that was part of the research sessions.



1. Data dump
2. Organize
3. Organize more
4. Articulate insights and prioritize next steps




#### Data Dump

Transfer all session notes into one place that everyone can access



*   No one tool is prescribed…. but Mural is great for this
    *   One idea/concept/quote per sticky note
*   Add any additional notes, observations, and takeaways
*   Use a different colored sticky note for each participant




#### Organize

Group similar quotes, observations, and ideas so that we can start to see what themes emerge



*   As groups begin to form, name the groups
*   It’s okay to duplicate post-its if they could belong in more than 1 group
*   It’s okay if there are outliers—we don’t need to group everything
*   We’ll get as far as we can in an hour




#### Organize more

Within each labeled group, identify tactics vs strategy



*   Label or separate post-its within each group as a tactical item vs. a strategic item
*   Tactical items are:
    *   A behavior or description of behavior directly observed or heard from the participants. Examples:
        *   “The participant could not find the word she was asked to find”
        *   “No, it says I can’t log in”
*   Strategic items are:
    *   Observations and interpretations from the team. Examples:
        *   “The participant seemed confused”
        *   “His voice sounded frustrated”
    *   “Ideal states” expressed by the user. Examples:
        *   “It would be cool if…”
        *   “I wish I could…”
        *   “What would be really helpful is…”
        *   “On this other site, the way they do it is…”



Articulate insights and prioritize next steps

Include *all* insights, not just pain points!



*   Using the organized post-its, write out the key themes that have surfaced
*   Strategic items: Formulate “How might we” statements
*   Tactical items: Formulate user stories
    *   As a [user type], I need to [take an action] so that I can [complete a goal].
*   Prioritize items to address
    *   Dot vote on all items OR
    *   Prioritize using impact/effort matrix OR…
    *   Whichever other prioritization method the team prefers
*   Incorporate high priority items into roadmaps/initiatives/sprint objectives
    *   If anything would be better suited to another team, meet with PM to get it on their roadmap

### 5. Read out results



---



#### Readout

The findings you uncover are most valuable to your team and should feed into future iterations of your initiative. Share findings with team (esp teams that findings impact) and stakeholders.

Create a deck, host a workshop, or facilitate a conversation that covers:



*   Research goals
*   Method
*   Participants
*   Findings (present ALL findings, not just pain points)
*   Prioritization framework/methodology
*   Next steps



Sample readouts



*   [TEMPLATE: VFS research readout](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18BzmktfnqHCW78SNkaPgQlZXUw178ZjbOimPRFoy1rE/edit?usp=sharing)
*   [EXAMPLE: VFS usability test readout](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/education-careers/school-comparison-tool/redesign/research/CT-RedesignReadout-ExecSum-20201130.pdf)
*   EXAMPLE: VSP Collaboration Cycle Custom Tracks




## Tools we use



*   Zoom: Used to conduct remote research sessions. You can record users and their screen. Review [Zoom Instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/zoom-instructions.md) before you use it.
*   Optimal Workshop: This is a research tool you can use to conduct card sorts, tree tests, or unmoderated prototype tests. You can also use the Reframer tool within Optimal Workshop to synthesize research.
*   Google Spreadsheet: Use this[ note taking template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QHJ6b7Y5tTu0G3GcONRMfAb_rmRligNeFqIGHOqUo4Y/edit#gid=123966766) for usability test sessions and synthesis.
*   Mural: This is a great group brainstorming tool. Can be used to conduct remote post-it synthesis, etc.
