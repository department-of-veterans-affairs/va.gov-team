# **Research Plan - Rules of Engagement (ROE)** 

## **Goals**

Our goal is to 1) understand the landscape of documentation of ROEs and how they are being used today 2) define requirements for a template to document ROEs that establish how VFS and VSP teams interact throughout the product development lifecycle.  

Background: 

- VSP teams currently organically develop and document ROEs. 
- [ROE documentation in Github and Zenhub (as of 10/9) ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1woGoEFrnkQpyV9zaDcuiLzLX9hDDAgG9jOn1tDWB38w/edit?usp=sharing)

Insights we hope to derive in asking these questions:

**Findability**

- Do people know ROEs exist for their practice area?
- Can people find them when they need them?
- How do people find them today?
- Are teams who are aware of ROEs more likely to exhibit the behavior outlined in them?
- What will make teams more likely to find and follow the ROE’s?

**Effectiveness**

- What information is useful in an ROE (per practice area)?
- Are VSP Team members fluent on ROEs across all areas, and thus know how VSP functions as a whole? Would people be able to say “oh, that’s not the way we do it here” if they saw a VFS team doing something that’s not aligned with our ROE?
- What practice areas still need to create an ROE?


## **Hypothesis**

- ROE documents will provide VFS teams with relevant, valuable information.
- ROEs help teams operate in alignment with VSP objectives.
- VFS teams don’t know about then which contributes to them not following the way we’d like to work together.



## **Method**

- Survey VSP team members regarding ROE documents.

  - Tool: Optimal Sort
- 8 remote interviews with 4 VFS teams, 2 people from each 

  - Tool: Zoom to record

We will use surveys to measure the gaps in understanding and completion of ROE documents. Interviews will allow us to ask qualitative questions and gain a deep understanding of the effectiveness of ROEs throughout the VFS user journey.

- Without searching, do you think an ROE document exists for your practice area?

  - Yes
  - No
  - I don’t know

- Have you ever contributed to an ROE? 

  - Yes
  - No
    - If yes, how did you decide what to include?

- Are VFS teams using your docs?

  - Yes

  - No

  - I don’t know

    - If yes/no/don’t know: how do you know?

      

**Interview questions for VFS team members:**

- How long have you worked on veteran-facing tools?
- What do a Rules of Engagement document mean to you?
- What would you expect from this type of document?
- Have you worked with a Rules of Engagement document before?
  - If yes, were they helpful?
- Are you aware that an ROE for your practice area exists? 
  - If yes, have you read it before? 
- Have you gone back to refer to it at any point in the process?
- What prompted you to go back to it?
  - Were you able to find it again?
- Was it helpful? Did you find what you were looking for? 
  - If not, what was missing? What questions did you still have after? What steps did you take to get your remaining questions answered?
- What would you add or change, if anything?
- Do you feel that having this document helped the process go more smoothly with the VSP team? How?
