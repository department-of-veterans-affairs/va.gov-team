## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Naomi and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the experience of the VFS team working with the VSP team.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 min.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the process so we can all better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

   

  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"**
