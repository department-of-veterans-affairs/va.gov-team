# ROE Documentation Research Readout

## Key Takeaways - VFS Interviews

Most participants said they were not aware that a Rules of Engagement document existed for their practice area and were not familiar with this type of document. The following observations were framed around the question “what if there was a document that …”. 



### Findability

**In order for people to feel confident they are doing the right thing, team members need to be able to easily find documents for processes and guidelines.**

Observation: Documents are scattered in a number of places (i.e. Slack, GitHub, GoogleDocs)
*“ Most documentation is pretty dispersed” [VFS Engineer]*
*“Used design system, design pattern library, search github and zenhub for templates, conversation guides and other research resources. [VFS Designer]*
*“Found info about specific design tasks from various slack channels (i.e. Team, VSA, DSVA)”*
*“**Did not derive it from documentation just living, breathing design team on slack.”*
\-----
Observation: People are reaching out to other team members to ask questions and send documents
*“I actually started off working with Layla, she was great and had a lot of information and gave me all kinds of information.” [VFS Designer]*

**How might we...** create a “single source of truth” for all documentation regarding platform processes and guidelines 



### Effectiveness

**To be an effective document, it will have to be tailored to each practice area and flexible enough to adapt to a variety of products being built.**

#### Product Management

Observation: Having a document that shows the intended process and explains the value of each step will help set expectations with the VA.

*“Having a formal process documentation is great for a conversation starter and we can all start on level playing fields is how I approached it as product manager. If it’s not working and my counterparts are not like this, then it kinda helps that discussion if things need to change.”* [VFS Product Manager]

*“I don't want to strictly go to platform, get guidance, and by the time my customers see it they don’t know what’s going on. As a customer we’re trying to solve whatever the issue is. Transparency is important why something is what it is. Why something gets to this point. I do a lot of stuff that works for my time, my relationships, my counterparts, don't know if it’s a one size fits all”* [VFS Product Manager]

**How might we...** use the ROE doc to help communicate the baseline processes to increase transparency between VA and VSP to help launch quality products?make it flexible enough to be useful for a variety of products/teams



#### Engineering/QA

Observation: Getting new members environments setup as quickly as possible is critical to meeting deadlines. 

*“I still have multiple engineers on my team that doesn't have socket access and that's a problem. There's a certain amount of access an engineer needs before they’re useful. We’re still waiting on PIV access which is insane, there’s a lot of kinds of blockers that are out of our hands.”* [VFS Engineer]

*“I wish I would've known that a lot of these... like Slack and Git and a few things... I should've set them all up on my other computer, not the GFE that's through the VPN… I'm just using the online features instead of downloading them and I'm not getting the notifications not having set them up on my computer... so I got everything I thought set up as well as I could, and I was fighting against it and someone said, "Oh you should've set all this up on your other computer!"* [QA Engineer]

**How might we...** show a complete list of access (with status) and steps an engineer needs to complete in order to be productive?



### Scalability

**Documentation has to be kept up-to-date in order to be trusted** 

Observation: Engineering documentation needs to be kept current to be effective

*Participant: Documentation is pretty hard to write. People also don’t like to update documentation.*

*Moderator: Why do you think that is?*

*Participant: People just don’t think about it. Swagger Docs is like that right now, it needs to be updated. We can’t represent our stuff properly. People don’t like writing documents. That’s the main thing or people don’t know where the documentation lives for things that they’re working on.* [VFS Engineer]

**How might we...** make updating documents easy for those who need to share their knowledge?

-----

Observation: Designers would benefit from knowing the most recent additions to the Design System

*"Going through the design system and staging site, for me it was studying it and seeing how the design system elements transferred to a live environment. When I look at how the alert was done and I see it used a certain way. When I go to the file, there wasn’t a 1 on 1 match. They left room for creativity, but the unfortunate part was the confusing part. As a new designer, trying to figure out what the relationship was of the design system and how it was being implemented was the really challenging part of figuring out how things go out."* [VFS Designer]

*"The challenge is the design system is always evolving. It is not a set of rules you just memorize."* [VFS Designer]

**How might we...** encourage designers to submit new patterns to the Design Systemkeep designers aware of the latest updates?



## Key Takeaways - VSP Survey

**Documentation has been created for most practice areas, but it’s not clear if it’s being used by the VFS teams.** 

- 11 out of 18 participants reported that a Rules of Engagement document exists for their practice area

-  11 out of 18 participants reported that they don’t know if their teams documentation is being used by VFS teams.

**How might we...** assess what documentation exists for each practice area?measure how useful the documentation is for the VFS team?create documents that address issues that VFS team members have?



## Next Steps

- Identify gaps in documentation

- Identify improvements to existing documents
