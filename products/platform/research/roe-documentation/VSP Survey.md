### How did you decide what to include?
* Went through a UX on boarding deck along with random documents like the design QA checklist
* I included the items I felt would provide designers, researchers, and front-end engineers the best chance to reduct low-level accessibility errors.
* Based on other practice areas
* I included answers to the questions that I've had to look up multiple times, and answers to questions that I've heard a few times from other people.
* Past experience, team goals, and platform north star
* I don't remember
* Triage ROE: thinking about user use cases, mostly around reporting issues, and thinking through the process of which kinds of user cases.
* Current business processes
* Based on my experiences, known pain points I've either felt or seen others feel
* We thought about what was pertinent for the VFS teams to know to successfully meet our expectation for developing on the platform



### Are people on VFS teams using your practice area's documentation?

* Yes - 6 participants
* No - 1 participants
* I don't know - 11 participants



### How do you know?

* I reference it frequently - not the github repo though - the client documentation site
* They need to use it to gain access
* Because we haven't officially published it yet
* I've seen the research docs linked to in Slack
* They've referenced docs when asking questions
* Am new. Was shown practice area documentation day one.
* I "think" so. We give it to them in on boarding, and I do see it referenced in Slack here and there (particularly Content's ROE - this seems fairly well integrated into VFS team workflows)
