## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jonathan and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about Platform . 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:



*   **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
*   **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet VFS team’s needs/Platform team’s need. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
*   **You'll be interacting with a prototype.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will have any permanent effects.
*   **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
*   **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    *   If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

_Start recording._



*   **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?** 


## Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes

Before we look at the prototype, let’s start with a few background questions.



*   What team are you on?
*   What is your role on the team?
*   How long have you been working on this project?

     

*   What are some ways VFS team members reach out to you for support? 
*   What questions or requests do you typically receive from VFS team members? 
*   When a VFS team member reaches out to you for support in #vfs-platform-support Slack channel, how do you typically respond to those requests? 
*   If you are unsure of the answer to a question, what do you typically do? 
*   What types of questions or requests do you typically receive in the #vfs-platform-support Slack channel? Or from VFS team members? 
*   What are some roadblocks in providing support to VFS team members?  

Great. Thank you for sharing those thoughts with us. It’s really important as we continue to improve our services and support. 


## Platform First Task: [Respond to customer support in Slack ] - 10 minutes

We put together a prototype that we would love to get your feedback on.

- Invite the participant to channel, instruct participants to open Slack and join channel, and share screen

- Moderator completes form with either frequent request mentioned in warm-up questions or scenario determined before by previous requested posts 



*   Let's say you are working as the support person and moderating the #vfs-platform-support Slack channel. I will be acting as the VFS team member and submit the request. Can you show me how you respond and support this request? (Submit form)


### Things to watch for:



*   Is the Slack post easily understandable? 
*   Is there enough information provided to respond to the request accurately? 
*   How would they respond or assist the VFS team member? 
*   Any hiccups? Anything trip them up? 


### Followup questions:



*   What do you think of responding to this form/post?
*   Was there enough information provided to respond to the post accurately? 
*   What was the hardest part? Were there any areas you felt were unclear?
