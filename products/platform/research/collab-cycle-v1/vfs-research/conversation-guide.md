### Introduction
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Naomi from the VSP Service Design team. I’m working with Megan and Andrea on gathering feedback on the VSP Collaboration Cycle. I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Your feedback will be helpful as we work to improve the process. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 1 hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the tools and resources that the Platform provides. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? 

*Start recording.*

  

### Framing and background
We’re going to ask you a series of questions related to the collaboration cycle but if you have feedback outside of these questions, please jump in and share it. 

#### Introduction/Overview
1. Tell me a little bit about your role and your team.
   1. How long have you been on this team?
2. What project have you been working on?
3. Have you gone through any VSP Collaboration Points?
  1. If yes, which collaboration points have you been through?
  2. Tell me about your experience
  
#### What’s working/not working
4. Tell me about a time when you felt that a review/collaboration point went well. Why?
5. Tell me about a time when you felt that a review/collaboration point didn't go well.
    Why?
    
#### Expectation
6. Before you went through these checkpoints, did you have any expectations of what they would be like?

#### Old vs New Process
7. Did you build anything on VA.gov before the VSP Collaboration Cycle was released in March 2020? 
  1. If so, how does this new process compare with the one you used before?

#### Value
8. Do you think the collaboration cycle offers value to your development cycle?
9. Thinking about the whole process, do you find the Collaboration cycle to be helpful or a hindrance to your development?
10. Do you think the Collaboration Cycle offers enough value to VA.gov to be worth the amount of time and process?
11. Is there any particular part of the Collaboration Cycle that you have found more or less valuable than others?
  
#### Process/Improvements
12. Do you have questions about the Collaboration Cycle?
13. Do you find asynchronous Collaboration points (i.e. IA Request) valuable?
  1. Are there asynchronous points that could be more valuable as a meeting?
  2. Are there meetings that could be asynchronous?
14. How has the delivery of the required artifacts gone? 
  1. Does the team know what artifacts are required? 
  2. Do they have enough time to create them?
  3. Are there areas where the platform can help with this?
15. Are there things that you do in the course of your development process that aren't in   the Collaboration Cycle that you think could help other teams?

#### Accessibility
16. Do you feel that you have had input at the right intervals?

#### Analytics  
17. Have you had any reviews or Collaboration points with Analytics? 

#### Privacy/Security Review
18. Have you had any Privacy/Security Review Collaboration points?


### Platform Collaboration Point Tracker
Now I’d like to ask you some questions about the Collaboration Point Tracker. 

19. Are you familiar with the Platform Collaboration Point Tracker? 
20. Do you find it useful?
21. Has the time and effort you've put into keeping the Tracker current seem worth it to you?

#### Survey
  22. Have you taken a survey after a checkpoint? 
        1. If not, what got in the way of completing it?

#### Closing
Well, we appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the process together.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
