- Take the stickies created in step 1 and move into the journey map structure
  - Make as many stages as you can get through with some detai
- Decide on what stage you’ll be mapping

NPS Score: 3
“The primary reason is that it takes a long time to get PRs through VSP review. The VSP workflow and tools slow down rather than accelerated development and are not well documented. New features/change are only announced via Slack and I often see others devs trip over issues I or my team have run across already.”

*"Our platform is a mess, it's such a mess I almost don't know what to put as the primary reason. If I had to give only one reason it would be that we seem to have made our stack overly complex when it does not need to be and then don't document those complexities or disseminate the information around those complexities. This creates specific members of the team that you must go to in order to get an explanation of how these complexities work and this creates choke points and blocks productivity. These choke points are going to make it very, very difficult to scale as a team.* 
*As an engineering team grows the information concerning the stack they work on needs to be spread throughout the engineering organization to empower the engineers, I as an engineering should not have to track down one person in the entire organization to ask a question about something that can easily be documented in a simple, well organized fashion. Senior engineers tend to be the centers of knowledge and they make themselves available, but that isn't the point. We work as if we are a team of 5-10 engineers where everyone can just reach out to anyone at any time, but as our team grows ( and particularly when we begin hiring Jr Engineers ) this ethos of "just ask someone" doesn't scale, it certainly won't work when we have 100 engineers, or 500 engineers, etc.*"

*I like to use the platform tools provided because it makes the VA.gov applications more scalable, and easier to maintain which also makes my job easier.*
