## Introduction

Thanks for joining us today! I’m Naomi and I’m working with the Design System team on VSP to gather feedback on the Design System and your general workflow. I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Your feedback will be helpful as we work to improve the process. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:



*   This entire session should take about 1 hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
*   In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the tools and resources that the Platform provides. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
*   If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
*   Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? 

Start recording.

Our session will be split into 2 parts. First, I’ll ask you a few questions, then I’ll send you a link to a Mural board where we’ll do a little workshop. Do you have any questions before we get started?



## Interview

### General Questions

1. How long have you been working on the platform?
2. Can you describe your role on the team?
3. What project are you currently working on?
4. What is helping you do your job?
5. What is getting in the way of you doing your job?
6. What do you see as the major critical issue facing your job?

### Designer

Design System

1. Do you feel you are getting sufficient recommendations on which components to use from VSP at the beginning of the Collab Cycle process?
2. Have you contributed to the Design System before?
	If yes, how was your experience?
        If no, do you know how to contribute?


Sketch Library

3. When was the last time you updated your Sketch library?
    1. Have you used a component from the Sketch library that wasn’t an official design system component? (i.e. cards)
	If yes, tell me about that experience
	If no, what are your expectations of components found in the Sketch
	library?
4. Is there anything that you’d want to become a symbol in the Sketch library that hasn’t been added yet?

## Workshop 

    Send a link to the Designer User Journey Workshop Mural board for each participant in the Zoom chat. See [Mural doc](https://app.mural.co/t/adhocvetsgov9623/m/adhocvetsgov9623/1604701405539/aeb0daba607388130d3de983824f9ca11fee752e)


### Step 1 - List your tasks

*   Take 5 - 10 min to quickly jot down activities you do in your job.

*   Create one sticky note per activity.


### Step 2 - Map it

*   Take the stickies created in step 1 and move into the journey map structure
    *   Make as many stages as you can get through with some detail
*   Decide on what stage you’ll be mapping
    *   If the user is in the middle of a stage at the moment, we may want to start with that
*   While the user is mapping and talking, take notes of thoughts, feelings and pain points
*   After the user is finished mapping, have them copy/paste a sentiment icon to **each step**

	

Areas to dig into

*   Design system
*   Using Sketch
*   Design QA
*   Content - who writes it?


## Closing

Well, we appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the process together.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
