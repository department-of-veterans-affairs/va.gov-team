# Analytics Playbook Product Outline

## Problem Statement
Knowledge of VA analytics sources and how to use analytics to help with product decision making can be confusing and scattered. (See user research notes 1 & 2)

How might we create an easy-to-use single source of truth for VFS teams that delivers both content to help with understanding data-informed decisions and the analytics resources that are available to facilitate an easier analytics journey?

## Vision
**Product decision makers understand how to make data-informed product decisions for building veteran-facing services on VA.gov and have resources available to help them along the way.**

Product decision makers (PMs, POs) building on VA.gov use the playbook as a quality, single source of truth for how to use data to inform decision making on VA.gov, including:
- Using data in the context of veteran services to improve user goals and business outcomes
- Understanding what VSP analytics services are available and at their disposal
- Having a starting point to launch off to other resource for additional research

## Audience
Product Managers & Product Owners building Veteran-facing Services (direct to Veteran)

## Desired User Outcomes
- VFS product decision makers use the playbook as a triage to other analytics resources
- VFS product decision makers use the playbook to help identify definitions, frameworks, and other analytics resources, both internal to the VA and externally, to help with improving user goals and business outcomes

## Undesired User Outcomes
- VFS teams don't use the playbook or don't know about the playbook and are more confused about which resources are available to them
- VFS teams are more confused about the analytics journey and what they need to do for successful data-informed decision making

## Desired Business Outcomes
- VA.gov has a playbook that can serve as a source of truth for using analytics for product management for digital services

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- The playbook messages clash with other VA analytics messages
- The playbook formatting clashes with the Collaboration Cycle

## Future Scope
- Include non-VFS team resources (like API, CMS, SSO)
- Expand to engineering resources

## Success Measurements
### Objectives
- Users can easily use the VSP analytics resources available
- Users use data-informed decision making towards their VFSs

### Key Results
- Users express positive sentiment towards the playbook
- Playbook users request VSP analytics resources (like a dashboard)
- Weekly analytics shares/discussions go up

### KPIs
- Monthly Active Users
- Monthly VSP analytics resource usage
  - Dashboard requests
  - Metrics reporting requests
- Monthly analytics Team of Teams discussions, including launch rollout metrics results and quarterly updates

## Assumptions
- An easy to visualize single source of truth will be used more often or more intensely
- DEPO will help market the playbook 
- The content will be useful to answer analytics FAQ
- VFS PMs will use more VSP Analytics resources
- The playbook will be useful during orientation and workshops, and with answering general analytics questions
- We will get more complex analytics requests as a result

---

## Solution Approach
- VSP Analytics & Insights will draft usable content of the playbook, including links to both internal and external resources. This content will include resources for some of the identified user pain points:
  - "I do not have time to prioritize setting KPIs"
  - "I don't know what resources the Analytics team has available"
  - "If we don't have baselines, then what's the point of setting KPIs?"
  - "We don't have a process for reflecting on these metrics"
  - "Once I have KPIs, what do I do with them?"
