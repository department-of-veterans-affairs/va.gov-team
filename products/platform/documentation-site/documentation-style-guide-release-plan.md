# Documentation Style Guide Release Plan 

- Product: Documentation Site ([product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/documentation-site/product-outline.md))
- Feature: Documentation Style Guide ([super epic](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsp-5cedc9cce6e3335dc5a49fc4/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/10006))

## Phase I: moderated production testing

### Planning:

As Phase 1 of our release, we are sending the drafted style guide to VSP leadership for feedback. We're taking this approach because we assume that VSP (in fact, our team) will be the heaviest users of the style guide.

- Date range: VSP Sprints 27 & 28 (June 2020)
- Number of users: ~5
- How you'll recruit: VSP leadership/Slack message
- How you'll test and give access: Drafted style guide is in a google doc

### Results:

- Number of users: 6 (VSP leadership & content experts) 
- Number of issues identified/fixed: N/A
- Types of errors: N/A
- Any UX changes necessary? Yes
- If yes, what: 
  - Changes to developer content
  - Grammar updates
  - Minor edits for clarity

## Phase II: unmoderated production testing

### Planning

- Date range: until June 30, 2020
- How you'll test and give access: Publish style guide in `va.gov-team` GitHub repo, socialize (via Slack) with VSP only
- Success criteria: 
  - VSP references the style guide & finds it useful (qualitative data - Slack â€” "was this useful?" and number of VSP team members who engage with announcement)

### Results: 

- Number of users: https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CJRQ85PQB/p1593012228005900
- Number of issues identified/fixed: 1/1
- Types of errors: Identified inconsistency within code example style
- Any UX changes necessary? No
- If yes, what: 
- Success criteria: 
  - Number of VSP team members who engage with announcement 
    - 4 different VSP team members outside of our team left comments
    - 13+ VSP team members noted the announcement (Slack reactions)
  - Did VSP team members find it useful?
    - Our team has found it useful! And responses from other VSP team members were positive
  
## Go Live!

### Planning:

Add link to docs style guide to MVP homepage and socialize word list on 6/30 Team of Teams meeting.

- Desired date: ~June 30, 2020~ Announced on 7/7 Team of Teams
- Post-launch KPI 1: Number of VSP support responses per month that include a link to the documentation style guide _(it is unlikely that we'll be able to get an accurate total here)
- Qualitative "was this useful?" responses from VSP & VFS team members 

### 1-month results:
- Number of unique users: x
- Post-launch KPI 1 actual: xx lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum
