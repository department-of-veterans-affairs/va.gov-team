# Lean UX Outline - Docs Site V2

Team: VSP Content & IA
Timeframe: Q2 2020 

_Based on the [Lean UX Outline from 12/19 discovery sprint](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/documentation-site/research/discovery-sprint-12-2019/lean-ux-outline.md)._

## Problem Statement 

VSP has created and updated many VFS-facing documents with the intention of providing clarity and tools for self-service to teams building on VA.gov. We are still observing that our documentation resources are not enabling teams to build seamlessly and iteratively on their own, and the one-off content-based updates we have been making are only helpful if teams are aware of and can find them when they need them. How might we identify and improve the user experience for a core set of VSP-owned documentation in order to create a set of introductory user guides for building on VA.gov? 

## Proto-personas

VFS teams (including contractors and embedded DEPO members, both technical and non-technical), are the top priority for the next iteration of the documentation site. We _assume_ that these teams are the greatest source of documentation support requests and "non-human-needed" manual support requests to VSP.

See [previous Lean UX Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/documentation-site/research/discovery-sprint-12-2019/lean-ux-outline.md) for full list of proto-personas â€” the list of personas has not changed, but our focus has.

## Assumptions 

### Business 

- We assume that documentation must default to public, in line with DEPO's "default to transparency" culture.
- We assume that "public documentation" means that an anonymous user can view and suggest edits.
- We assume that some documentation cannot be public and must have restricted access.

### User

- We assume that the majority of documentation support requests come to VSP from VFS team members.
- We assume that product documentation should be created and maintained by VFS teams.
- We assume that cultural differences among all teams building on and in support of VA.gov make it hard to adopt one standard documentation process across all teams.
- We assume that users need to be able to update documentation without the help of a developer (but that in the short term, the users who will be updating documentation are fairly tech-savvy). 
- We assume that users will adopt a documentation solution and default to self-service.
- We assume that most technical and non-technical documentation should live in the same place. **_Needs validation._**
- We assume that some technical documentation will be so granular and specific that it should live with the code it refers to.

## Hypothesis 

We believe that creating a consolidated, searchable, published set of user guides for building on VA.gov comprised of VSP-owned, VFS-facing documentation for VFS teams (including contractors and embedded DEPO members) will result in a single source of truth for using the platform to build on VA.gov that is robust and well-maintained. We will know we are right when traffic to the documentation solution increases and documentation support requests and "non-human-needed" support requests decrease.
