# Conversation Guide

## Moderator logistics

*Need to add modifications for in-person sessions*

*Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.*

*Before the session, send out the [observer instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).*

*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Intro - 1 minute

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Emily and I also have some colleagues here observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about VA.gov platform documentation. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 10 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet the needs of folks building on the VFS platform. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record your screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start screen recording using Quicktime, enable audio recording as well. Or if video recording is available, begin video recording with camera facing the screen.*

## Warm Up Questions - 2 minutes
* Before we start, I want to take a few minutes to ask you some questions.
* Can you tell me a what project you work on?
* What is your practice area?
   
#### VA.gov-specific documentation questions and scenario setup
* Are you familiar with the Veteran-Facing Services Platform?
    * If yes: Tell me about that. Then move onto next question.
    * If no: next question. Explain what the Veteran-Facing Services Platform (VSP) is:
      * The VSP is the common infrastructure, technical and non-technical components, and processes that support static and interactive content consumed by Veterans via VA.gov. Major pieces of the VSP include a set of APIs that manage communication between a Veteran user and internal VA resources, an identity and authentication system, a design system based on the U.S. Web Design System, reusable frontend components, a Drupal-based content management system, and an extensive set of documentation and guides.

We are going to pretend that you are a [developer, designer, researcher, whichever practice area they are] on the new contractor team coming to work on the VSP. This project has been going on for years, and your team is taking over for the previous contractor. Today is your team's first day. I'm going to pull up the primary repo that the VA.gov team uses for documentation, and ask you a few questions and do a few tasks.

As a [practice area-specific to the participant's role, ie. designer, front-end engineer, etc.]... 
* What are some things you would want to do on your first day? 
* What is the first thing you imagine you would need?
* What would you expect to find to help you get started?

## First task: React to table of contents

Alright, let's say that someone emailed you a link to the VA.gov github repo. This is the page that loads, and this is the only resource you've been given about the project so far on your first day.

Open repo link

* Take a moment to scan this page, and walk me through what goes through your mind.
    * What kind of information are you looking for on your first day?
    * What questions does this information prompt, if any?
    * Where would you go to find information about your practice area?
    * Before clicking anywhere else, what would you do next?
    
## Second task: Navigating to practice areas
    
* Next, show me how you would find more information about your practice area.

[Allow them to navigate themselves]

* [If they find their practice area readme]
  * Tell me about what you see here. What do you think the purpose of this page is?
  * Who would you contact if you had a question?
  
* [If they don't find their practice area readme]  
  * Tell me what prompted you to click on that link.
  * Are you finding what you're looking for?
  * Do you have questions that you're not seeing the answers for?
  
* How ready do you feel to start contributing on your first day?
* What would you do next?
  
### Things to watch for:
* Can they find the answer to their questions using the documentation?
* How quickly would they resort to asking a human?
* Feeling stuck, confused, frustrated
* Do they feel confident in the information they've found?
* Did they take a direct path to their practice area? (Main readme > #Practice area section link > Practice area readme)

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the documentation site and make sure it really works for people who are building for Veterans.
