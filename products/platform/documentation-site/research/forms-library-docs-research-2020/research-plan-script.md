# VSP Research Plan for Content & IA Team, Forms Library Documentation, June 2020

## Goals	

1. What product [tool/service/document/process] & VSP team are you doing this research for? 

   1. This research is for the [forms library documentation](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/forms/) on the Content and IA team, in collaboration with members of the Product Support and Front-End Tools teams.

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? Link to the product outline.

   The VA.gov Forms System is a standardized set of form fields, validation functions, and data flows that provide a starting point for teams building Veteran-facing applications and forms on VA.gov. The Forms System has a documentation site ([here](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/forms/)) that provides guidance and instructions for how to use it. However, engineers on VFS teams frequently have questions about the forms system because the documentation is incomplete in some places, and isn't totally clear in others. Feedback VSP has heard so far indicates that the documentation is the most useful when a team first sets up and gets started on a project, but its usefulness deteriorates as the engineers develop their teams'  unique forms. 

   Also, the VSP Front-End Tools team is working on improving the Forms Library itself, and this research will help inform how we document the improvements and additions to it. We have an idea for structuring the documentation that we would like to validate: a "recipe" type of approach where developers are provided the building blocks they can assemble.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?
  - How effective is the current structure/IA of the Forms System documentation?
    - Can developers find what they are looking for?
    - Does the technical forms documentation need to be separate from other documentation?
  - What are the biggest information gaps in the forms system documentation site?
    - What questions does the documentation successfully answer?
    - What questions do developers still have after reading the documentation?
    - What questions do developers frequently ask teammates or VSP staff during or after reading the documentation?
    - What other resources do developers use to supplement the documentation site if they still have questions?
  - How effective is the recipe format and structure for helping developers make decisions? 

1. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	
  - Our hypothesis is that engineers on VFS teams find the documentation site helpful when they are first getting started, but less helpful when they are making important and more advanced decisions about their forms.
  - Gaps in the forms system documentation lead to VFS team engineers creating their own reference materials that meet their needs.
  - The recipe structure will be an effective way to help developers make decisions about their forms.


## Method	

1. What method of research are you planning? 
   1. We will use a combination of remote, moderated directed interviews and usability testing.
2. Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	
   1. We will use a combination of interviews and usability testing because some of the information we want to gather can be done by asking questions and getting insight into developers' thought process, while other informatin will be best gathered by presenting tasks and observing how the participant completes them while also talking through their thought process.
3. Where are you planning to do your research?
   1. We will use Zoom to conduct the remote sessions.
4. What will you be testing? 
   1. We will be testing the [forms system documentation site](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/forms/) as well as a prototype of the recipe formatting. Link to the recipe formatting tbd.

## Participants and Recruitment	

1.  Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant? (Mention: Number of participants, practice areas, VFS team, VFS product. Please keep in mind that we have a limited number of VFS teams, and we should avoid going to the same people and teams back-to-back.)
    1.  We would like to talk to 4-5 front-end developers from a variety of VFS teams working on a variety of forms. 
    2.  We will update this document when we have confirmation from all the participants.
2.  What is your recruitment strategy? (Usually it is a Slack message directly to the team or team members. Contact the Design Lead if you need help getting in touch with anyone.)	
    1.  We have already gotten a few volunteers for this research, but will reach out to other teams via their Slack channel.

## When? 	

1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	(Schedule your research at least 1 week in advance if possible to give your participants time to organize their calendars) 	
   1.	We will conduct this research during VSP Sprint 27, or between May 28-June 9.
2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	
   1.	TBD on the recipe formatting.
3.	Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling: e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
   1.	We will schedule 1 hour with each participant.
4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.) that are hopefully flexible enough to accommodate our participants' busy schedules. Keep in mind that VFS team members are also remote and live in different time zones. Try and keep research sessions during normal working hours.	
   1.	Scheduling will be determined and updated here once we've identified all of our participants.


5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 

   1.	We will pilot the research with a front-end developer from VSP. Date, time, and person TBD and this document will be updated to reflect that once we have confirmation.
