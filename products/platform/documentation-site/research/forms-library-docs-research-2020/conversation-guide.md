## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Emily and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about documentation for the Forms Library. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about an hour** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet developers’ needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable sharing your screen as we talk through a few tasks today so that we can see what you're seeing?**
    - If yes: **Great, I will let you know when we are ready for you to screenshare.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 
*Start recording.*
- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record the screen the audio as we talk today?" 

## First Task: Navigate to the forms library documentation

- To start, let’s talk a bit about the forms library documentation. Are you familiar with the forms library? 
    - If NO, introduce the site and skip to second task.
- What role does it play in your day-to-day work?
- _Ask participant to begin sharing their screen, confirm it's working_
- Will you show us how you navigate to it?
- About how frequently do you reference it?

### Things to watch for:
- Do they know about it?
- Have they bookmarked it?
- Watch for trouble finding it: Searching in Slack, searching in Github

## Second Task: Evaluate current structure and IA

- Does this documentation have all the information you need to reference to do your work?
- Do these options [side navigation] reflect how you organize and think about your work? 
    - Why? 
    - Why not? 
    - In what way is it different?
    - Possible follow up: How do you organize and think about your work?
- What parts of the documentation site have you found useful?
- What is an example of a question you’ve attempted to answer using the documentation site?
- Walk us through the process of how you would find the answer to that question. (share screen, click through documents, think aloud)

## Third Task: Identify gaps and areas that need clarity

- What types of questions has the documentation successfully answered for you?
- What questions do you still have after referencing this documentation site?
- What types of decisions does this documentation help you make? 
    - Why?
- Is this different from your expectations/desires?
- What types of decisions is this documentation NOT useful for? 
    - Why?
- How do you get those questions answered?
- What other resources play a role in your day-to-day work building forms? 
    - If there are links, can you send them to us?
- At what point in the process has this documentation been the most helpful? 
    - Least helpful? 
    - Why?
- Are there any sections in particular that standout as useful? 
    - Not useful? 
    - Why?

## Fourth task: Evaluate effectiveness of recipe format

Thank you so much for all of your input and feedback. Alright, now I’m going to ask you to take a look at some new documentation we’ve been working on. Remember, we are *not* testing you in any way. There is nothing here that you can get “wrong” - you are helping us determine how to make it better. There are no wrong answers!

_Share link to recipe format_

- What I’ll ask you to do first is read this [Document? Section? Set of instructions?] and tell me what it’s instructing you to do.
- Imagine you are building a form, and have already set up the basic framework and overall flow for each screen. Based on this [recipe], what is it asking you to do next?
- What steps would you take?
- What questions does this spark, if any?
= Does this format seem relevant to engineering decisions you have to make about how your form is built? 
    - Why? 
    - Why not?
- Does this reflect how you think about your work? Why? How? Why not?

[This section will probably need to be updated once the recipe type of format is ready]

## Post-Task Interview - X minutes

That covers all of the things we wanted to talk about with you today! 

- Are there any other thoughts you’d like to share about this documentation site?
- Is there anyone else you think we should talk to about this?
- Before we wrap up, do you have any questions for me? 
- Please send any links that you mentioned to #vsp-content-ia

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on our documentation and make sure it works for developers.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
