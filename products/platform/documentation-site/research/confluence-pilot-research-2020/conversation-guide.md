## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liani and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. We are creating new platform documentation, and a big part of that is readjusting the information architecture, aka how info is organized and structured.  This session will be split into 3 parts: 

1. A conversation about XYZ, then
2. A short activity that'll help us do a coherence check on our experimental structure, and finally
3. We'd love to hear your thoughts on the activity.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about an 45-minutes** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. And we will *not* be on the video call for some of it. I'll explain more about that shortly.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet developersâ€™ needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 
*Start recording.*
- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record the screen the audio as we talk today?**

## Pre-activity interview: Evaluation of current developer documentation

- Before we get started with the activity, I have a few questions about our current platform documentation.  Are you familiar with it?

- What has been their experience working with platform developer documentation so far? 
- When did you last reference the documentation for your work?
- What were you working on? 
- Was the documentation useful? 
- (If they were able to find relevant documentation) How did you find it? (i.e., Did they have to ask someone else for a link or did they find it on their own) 

- Do you feel like you know what Platform Engineers are working on and how it impacts your work? How would find that information? What information would be useful to know? How/where would they expect to receive that info? (e.g., Slack, release notes, announcement in a meeting, newsletter, etc.)

Alright! Thank you so much for that input, that is really helpful for us to hear. Now we're going to transition to the activity and I'll start by sharing my screen and going over the instructions.


## Tree test activity: Coherence check on experimental IA

- Can you see my screen okay?
- So what you are looking at here is a Google doc that has a series common examples of form components and instructions on how to fit all the parts together. As the title suggests, we're considering this a "quick reference guide" for common problems developers need to solve when building forms on VA.gov. We expect that this quick reference guide will eventually be paired with other documentation such as an introduction to the forms library, but today we're hoping to get your feedback on the approach we're taking with the quick reference guide. 
- In addition, you'll notice that throughout the Google doc, there are comments in the sidebar providing an _additional_ layer of instructions and asking you questions and asking for your feedback about the document.
- What we're asking you to do for the next 30 minutes is to follow the instructions in the [blue box] and in the comments throughout this document. We'll end the video call and let you do this asynchronously on your own, and then after 30 minutes we'll come back together and wrap up. If you get stuck or run into trouble, that is totally okay! There's nothing you can do wrong here, and anything you experience is helpful for us to improve these documents. However, if you get _really_ stuck and need to "phone a friend," we have set up this DM in Slack with you - please send us a message there and we can come back together. 
- I'll keep a timer for 30 minutes, and then re-open our Zoom link so that we can ask you a couple more questions and wrap up. I will send the zoom link to our DM after 30 minutes have passed. 
- If you finish before 30 minutes is up, send a message to that same group DM and we can re-convene a little early. And if you don't finish all of the tasks in this time period, that is also totally okay. We want to be respectful of your time and not keep you longer than our allotted hour. 
- Do you have any questions so far?
- Okay, let's look at the first task together to make sure we're all on the same page.

_Scroll down to first task_

_Read task aloud_

_Demonstrate adding a comment with the response_

_Send participant the link_

- Can you access the document? _Confirm they can get into the doc_
- What questions do you have before we let you get to it?

Okay, unless we hear from you in the direct message, we'll see you in 30 minutes.

_End the zoom call_

_Start 30 minute timer_

_Monitor Slack DM to field for questions or messages from the participant_

_After 30 minutes, send message to group DM with zoom link prompting everyone to re-join the Zoom call._


## Post-activity interview

Okay, we are back! I am going to begin the recording again.

_Begin recording again_

We just have a few more questions for you to wrap us up.

- What are your overall thoughts on how information was organized? 
- Were there any tasks that you struggled with more than others?  (Tell me more / tell me why)
- Do you have recommendations or suggestions for developer docs navigation?


## Thank-You and Closing

Thank you so much for doing this with us. Your input is really valuable and helps shape the type of support that we give to VFS teams, and we really appreciate your time.

Have a great day!
