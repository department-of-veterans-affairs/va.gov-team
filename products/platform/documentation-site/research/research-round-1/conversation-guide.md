# Conversation Guide

## Moderator logistics

*Need to add modifications for in-person sessions*

*Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.*

*Before the session, send out the [observer instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).*

*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Emily and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about VA.gov platform documentation. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 15 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet the needs of folks building on the VFS platform. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record your screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

## Get comfortable on the machine
* Okay. I'm going to give you control of my laptop and ask you to complete a few tasks.
* The page that we will start on is already loaded in another tab.
* Are you comfortable using a Mac with a trackpad?
    - *If not, ask the participant to navigate to Google and search for a news story to get used to the trackpad*
* Now, I'm going to start recording our session.

*Start screen recording using Quicktime, enable audio recording as well.*

## Warm Up Questions - 5-10 minutes
* Before we start, I want to take a few minutes to ask you some questions.
* Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (Where do they live, what practice area do they focus on, what do they work on now)

#### General onboarding questions
* Have you ever built a digital product or service for VA, or another government entity?
   * Can you tell me about your experience?
   * What was the onboarding experience like?
* When is the last time you onboarded onto a new project?
   * Tell me about that experience.
   * What is something that you did on your first day?
   * Who were the key players?
   * What went well?
   * What could've gone better?
   * What steps did you take when you had questions?
       * What do you do when you can't find the answer on your own?
   * What role did documentation play?
   * What advice would you give to a new team member getting started on the same project?
   
#### VA.gov-specific documentation questions and scenario setup
* Are you familiar with the Veteran-Facing Services Platform?
    * If yes: Tell me about that. Then move onto next question.
    * If no: next question. Explain what the Veteran-Facing Services Platform (VSP) is:
      * The VSP is the common infrastructure, technical and non-technical components, and processes that support static and interactive content consumed by Veterans via VA.gov. Major pieces of the VSP include a set of APIs that manage communication between a Veteran user and internal VA resources, an identity and authentication system, a design system based on the U.S. Web Design System, reusable frontend components, a Drupal-based content management system, and an extensive set of documentation and guides.

We are going to pretend that you are a member of a new contractor team coming to work on the VSP. This project has been going on for years, and your team is taking over for the previous contractor. The team you are joining is working on the [APIs; tools; infrastructure; experience; identity] components of the VSP. Your team is currently working on [expanding the APIs to access a new internal VA resource; updating the design system incorporate the latest USWDS release; updating guidelines for GA usage; adding a new identity provider].

As a [practice area-specific to the participant's role, ie. designer, front-end engineer, etc.]... 
* What are some things you would want to do on your first day? 
* What is the first thing you imagine you would need?
* What would you expect to find to help you get started?

## First task: React to table of contents

Okay, I am going to ask you to open the [practice area specific Table of Contents] tab next.

* Take a moment to scan this page, and tell me what you're looking at here.
    * What is the purpose of this page?
    * What do you think you can do here?

* Do you think you could find the answer to any of the questions that you asked previously?
    * Why or why not?
    * Go ahead and try.
    * Was that what you expected to find? Why or why not?
    
 * Does the content that you see here prompt any questions that you didn't have previously?
     * How would you find the answers to those questions?

## Second task: Practice-area specific tasks (maybe do these if previous task doesn't prompt exploration)

* *Product* How would you set up your first product outline?
* *Research* Show me how you would find out how to recruit research participants for a usability study.
* *Design* How would you find out what design tools are available?
* *Accessibility* How would you find out how to request an accessiblity QA check?
* *Devops* How would you find out more about the code review and reslease process?
* *Front-end* How would you set up to run the design system locally?
* *Back-end* How would you find out more about the load testing process?
* *QA* How would you find out how to record bugs?
* *Analytics* How would you learn what to set up before launching a new product?
* *Content* Where would you look for guidlines about the VA voice and tone?
  
### Things to watch for:
* Can they find the answer to their questions using the documentation?
* How quickly would they resort to asking a human?
* Feeling stuck, confused, frustrated

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes
