# Logging Product Outline
---

## Overview
We are implementing Loki as a logging solution for teams working on VA.gov.   

## Problem Statement
Right now logging  is not a  great experience on VA.gov.  All  the logs are within cloud watch logs  in  AWS which requires AWS consul access to view. That process can take months and even after getting access it is not a full logging experience. Another method that is being used is Sentry, which  is not meant to be a logging tool. This leads to confusion and having logging all over the place and hard to access. It also have been identified as a top  pain point  for both VSP and VFS teams.

How might we create a  better logging experience on  VA.gov that can  make logging easy, accessible, and scalable. 
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Users can access logging soon after they go through orientation
- Logging is easy to use
- Logs can be exported if need be

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Keep using old logging methods after this implementation
- Didn’t like Grafana, so won’t like Loki

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Developers can solve problems in their  ode faster due to logging access sooner
- Developers will save time due to more straight forward logging 
- Development speed will increase
- Higher quality code

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Not being used and therefor not helping

## Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### KPIs
* (Most Important) Decrease in amount of time it takes for a developer to access logs
* Increase in number of users using Loki
* Decrease number of logging  info in Sentry  
* Less requests around logging issues
* Service Design receives less pain points around logging
* Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
	* TBD

#### Baseline KPI Values
* Time it takes a user to access cloudWatch ~2 weeks- 1+month

## Assumptions
- Having Loki that works in Grafana will make adoption easier because most developers are familiar with Grafana already 
- We are able to speed up the time for users to access their logs 
- Loki is the best tool for right now

## Solution Approach

- We are building out Loki with fluent bit and fluent D in our current Infra and testing there. A demo can be found here: Link to demo TBA
- Now that we are using  Far gate/ ECS we can build this outside of BRD
- Depending on User feedback during and after rollout we will iterate  on this solution. 

--- 

## Go-to-market Strategy
- We will be working with both VSP and VFS teams to help them understand  the new logging model. We will also provide documentation and work with other teams in VSP to boost our communication. 
- We need to let all developers working on VA.gov know this change will happen a good bit before the launch .
- [Link to Release Plan](#go-to-market-strategy) TBA

## Solution Narrative

### Current Status
Loki is being buildout in ECS 

### Key Decisions
- We will be moving forward with Loki because it address out needs and is lightweight
- Met with VSP BE tools to go over options 
- Now that we are using AWS products we can build out this in the current infra.
