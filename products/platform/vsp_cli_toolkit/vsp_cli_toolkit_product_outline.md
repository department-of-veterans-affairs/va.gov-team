# VSP Command Line Interface (CLI) Toolkit

## Overview

The VSP CLI will make it easy and automated to create/manage/troubleshoot different aspects of your development environments and processes.

## Problem Statement

We (VSP) don't have an automated way to troubleshoot or identity issues that individuals are encountering during development.  Our current process is manual, which often includes a specific set of initial troubleshooting tasks.

For example, a VFS team that requests support from VSP doesn't have a quick and automated way to ensure they have the correct SOCKS configuration present and that they are connected successfully to the correct development environment in which they believe the issue to present.

## Personas

VSP Developers - Initial troubleshooting and possibly initial configuration setup

VFS Developers - Assisting in troubleshooting support requests as well as configuration tasks.

Non developers - Automating different aspects of the on-boarding process to gain SOCKS access.

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

TBD

* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Grafana or other dashboards/reports where possible_

#### Baseline KPI Values

TBD

* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics, if possible._

## Assumptions
- Developers will use a command line tool to troubleshoot over documentation.
- Toolkit can be developed in a simple manner across different teams as needs are determined.
- The centralization of these tasks will reduce friction to finding solutions elsewhere.
- Other teams besides BE Tools will benefit and contribute to this project as it grows in scale.

## Solution Approach

- Design/Discovery sprint to identity the highest value least effort initial parts
- Prototype the initial tool
- Test prototype with teams
- Iterate
