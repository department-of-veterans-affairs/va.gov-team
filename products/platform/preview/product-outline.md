# Platform's VA.gov "Preview" Feature

## Problem statement
VA has said "no" to getting prod users that aren't actually really people into MVI and MHV. David Bao and others have tried to push on this.

Massive index of staging users and what they should/shouldn't have access to is hard to use.

Dependent systems in staging are down all the time.

You need different users to test different pieces of functionality across the site. There's not really one user that has good data in place to get a good prod-like experience for all of the tools across VA.gov.

## User goals
As a contact center rep, in order to advise users of VA.gov, I need to familiarize myself with the logged-in experience of VA.gov.

As a VFS sprint team, I need to demo my app to stakeholders when it's still a WIP and after it's already built (including to contact centers, VA leadership, unsure if there are more...?) to show how my app works.

As a VFS sprint team, I need to QA my app in dev/staging.

## Assumptions

## MVP Appproach

## KPIs

## Narrative
10/20/19: this sprint (12) JP and Leah will compile technical and user discovery information about the problem space. We're thinking of doing a design/discovery sprint the following sprint (13) w/the objective of defining a solution approach, epics and user stories, and KPIs by the end of the 5 day "sprint". Output would include a doc w/tradeoffs and recommendations, the ppl we’ll need to lean on, the changes that will be dependencies to make this work, that we can take to Chris and Charles.

This could also serve as a good opportunity to test out what it's like have Service Design team lead a time-boxed discovery/research/strategy/definition engagement for a solution that ultimately gets owned/implemented by another team.
## Epic(s):
[Set up appropriate solution to test VA.gov in staging](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsp-5cedc9cce6e3335dc5a49fc4/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/1326)
