# Unit Testing (Frontend) - Product Outline [DRAFT]

## Overview
TBD

## Problem Statement
Unit tests test a single part of implementation in code (a unit). All FE apps on VA.gov should have unit tests (VSP's [unit testing guidance](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/getting-started/common-tasks/new-unit-test/) is that tests cover at least 75% of code paths). VSP has limited guidance on best practices for unit tests, and does not currently report on test coverage. We know that unit tests are a pain point (because as of Q4 2020 they keep failing and causing builds to fail), but we have a very limited aggregate view into how VFS teams are writing them. 

How might we improve the stability and coverage of `vets-website` unit tests while maintaining VFS team automony? 

## Personas
- VFS engineers
- VSP engineers

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* Average percent unit test coverage of VFSs [blocked by,]
* Number of VFS teams that report on unit test coverage
* Number of teams blocked when a unit test fails, on average

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics, if possible._

---

## Assumptions
- VFS teams should be responsible for testing their own apps

## Solution Approach

See [Unit test overview](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/getting-started/common-tasks/new-unit-test/) in FE documentation for a description of the current solution approach.
