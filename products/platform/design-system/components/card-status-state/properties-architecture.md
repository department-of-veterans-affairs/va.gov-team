## Architecture Overview

The high-level vision behind the component’s architectural direction which could include how it will handle properties/data, present markup, its flexibilities and constraints. This might also be a good place to list features.

## Tests (e2e & unit)

Tests that will be written for the component.

## Storybook Examples

List the component examples and variations that will be displayed in Storybook.

## Future Considerations

If this is an MVP, we should outline anything that we might need to account for in future iterations of the component.
