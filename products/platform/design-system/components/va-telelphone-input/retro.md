## ✅ What Went Well 


## 🧩 Design & Implementation

* First component design work was well executed 

* Ian’s validation behavior design was especially strong 
* Adding pattern to forms libary
* Product outline, decision log, and architecture docs were helpful for this fast-moving, still-getting-organized new team.

* Documenting and referencing design decisions proved valuable (e.g., helped another team understand “why X”) 



### 🧪 Accessibility Practices

* A11y checklist surfaced issues ahead of staging review 

* First-time writing accessibility validation tests early — successful! 

* Accessibility collaboration/process was productive when done early 



### 💬 Team Collaboration & Communication

* Slack channel for international phone work enabled early planning and alignment 

* Good collaboration across teams 

* Jeana appreciated Ian’s patience and flexibility in handling evolving questions 



### ⚙️ Tools & Support

* AI support with country sprite sheet and CSS was efficient 

* Figma branching was a learning experience

## ⚠️ Challenges

### 🎯 Requirements & Scope Clarity

* Initial scope misunderstood — started as a simple regex, evolved into a full component 

* Didn’t define validation behavior/states clearly from the start 

* Missed early clarity on whether this would be a new forms pattern 



### 📱 Mobile Integration**

* Unclear expectations around Native Mobile involvement 

* Still unsure how mobile team needs align with component work 



### 🧪 Accessibility Timing

* A11y testing came too late, surfaced staging issues that could’ve been caught earlier 



### 🧠 Team Process & Coordination**

* Coordination complexity with multiple epics, outlines, teams 

* Figma branching issues caused rework 

* Time pressure made norming as a team more difficult

## ✅ Action Items 

### 🎯 Improve Requirement Clarity

* 🔹 *During Sprint Zero*: Clearly define **validation states/behaviors 
* 🔹 *Sprint Zero*: Ask **“Is this a new forms pattern?”** → If yes, coordinate early with the forms team 


### 🧪 Accessibility Process Enhancements

* 🔹 *Sprint Zero*: Document **accessibility test expectations** and start test writing early 

* 🔹 Define **keyboard and touch validation** expectations upfront 



### 🤝 Cross-Team Coordination

* 🔹 Explore consolidating epics/outlines into a **centralized project view 

* 🔹Use **GitHub Discussions** for future collaborative work (esp. when multiple Slack channels emerge)
