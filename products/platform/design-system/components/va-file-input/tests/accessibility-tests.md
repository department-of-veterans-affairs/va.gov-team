# WIP CONCEPT

# va-file-input — Accessibility Test Plan

## 🧭 Component Overview
**Description:**  
The `va-file-input` component allows users to upload one or more files through a browser interface. After upload, the UI updates to display:  
- The file name  
- The file size  
- Any applicable error messages  
- A **Change** button  
- A **Delete** button
- A **Password** input (optional)
- An additional field input (optional) 

The component may be marked as *required* or *optional*, depending on the form context.

**Primary user tasks:**  
- Upload a file  
- Replace a file  
- Delete a file  
- Proceed with or without uploading (depending on requirement state)

**Key accessibility risks:**  
- Focus not returning to the correct location after an upload or deletion  
- Status messages not announced correctly (upload complete, file errors)  
- Inconsistent behavior across screen readers for dynamic changes  
- Inaccessible error messaging for invalid file types or sizes  
- Unexpected focus movement when required fields block submission

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

The following scenarios validate expected accessibility behavior.  
Each follows the **When / Then** pattern.

### Test ID: upload-focus-success
**Purpose:**  
Verify that after a successful upload, focus remains stable without unexpected shifts.

**WCAG:**  
- 2.4.3 Focus Order  
- 4.1.3 Status Messages  

**Setup:**  
Navigate to a form page containing a single `va-file-input`. [Using storybook for this testing on a branch](https://file-input-focus-and-sr--65a6e2ed2314f7b8f98609d8.chromatic.com/iframe.html?globals=&args=&id=uswds-va-file-input--default&viewMode=story)

**Steps:**  
1. When the user activates the **Choose file** button.  
2. And selects a valid file.  

**Expected Result:**  
- Then focus moves to the component wrapper text "Selected files".
- And the post-upload UI is announced by screen readers "Selected files" and File name.  
- And no unexpected page-level focus shifts occur.

#### Actual behavior:

**Screen readers**

**1. Chrome + VO:**   
  - ✅ **When using the link:** VO Virtual cursor lands on "Selected files" and announces "Selected files: Filename.extension" The next tab is the "Change file" button.
  - ❓ **When dragging the file:** When I drag the file, and the UI changes to show the file name, the virtual cursor seems to be on the entire viewport. It reads the page `<title>` tab name, and then will announces "Selected files: filename.extension". The next tab stop is the "Change file" button

**2. Safari + VO:**   
  - ✅ When using the link: Focus moves from finder to the browser, and the VO virtual cursor lands on the viewport, and announces "Selected files: filename.extension". The next tab is the "Change file" button.
  - ❌ When dragging the file: Focus does not move to the browser, even though the UI is updating and the file seems to be uploading. When the user changes focus back to the browser the `<title>` is announced, followed by the label of the file input "Select a file to upload" no success message is announced saying the file is selected or uploaded.

**3. Safari + iOS + VO:**   
  - ✅ **When using the link:** Virtual cursor lands on the "Select a file to upload" file input label (not in the uploaded UI). And announces "Selected files filename.extension". The next swipe takes the user to the Change file button
  - **When dragging the file:** Not applicable in this test case

**4. Chrome + iOS + VO:**
  - ❌ **When using the link:** It appears focus is lost. The Virtual Cursor ends up in the URL bar of the browser, and begins announcing the URL of the page
  - **When dragging the file:** Not applicable in this test case

**5. Firefox + JAWS:**
  - ❌ **When using the link:** It appears focus is lost. After the UI indicates a change, JAWS begins announcing the `<title>` of the page, and eventually announces "You have selected files filename.extension" (And it announces this twice). The next tab does go to the change file button
  - **When dragging the file:** 

**6. Firefox + NVDA:**
  - **When using the link:** NVDA Announces "Va-file-input default modular firefox, va-file-input default document, selected files, you have selected the file filename.extension." 
  - **When dragging the file:** When dragging a file over, initially nothing happens until I focus the browser again. JAWS virtual cursor seems to be on the entire viewport. It seems like something starts to announce, but then something interrupts it and it starts reading the `<title>`. It eventually announces "Selected files" but never announces the file names. The next tab takes me to the change file button.
    
**7. Edge + JAWS:**
  - ❌ **When using the link:** It appears focus is lost. After the UI indicates a change, JAWS begins announcing the `<title>` of the page, and eventually announces "You have selected files filename.extension". The next tab does go to the change file button.
  - **When dragging the file:** 

**8. Edge + NVDA:**
  - **When using the link:** NVDA Announces "Va-file-input default profile 1 microsoft edge window, selected files, selected files, you have selected the file filename.extension." A Dotted border is around part of the UI.
  - **When dragging the file:** When dragging a file over, focus goes to the browser, and the virtual cursor is highlightin the entire viewport. However, it announces `<title>` first. And then eventually it will announce "Selected files filename.extension". The next tab takes me to the change file button.


**Magnifcation & Zoom**
No identified issues across Safari, Chrome, Edge, Firefox

**Voice control**
1. Chrome - Mac Voice Control -  can use voice control to activate initial file upload. However, voice control cannot access the "change file" or "delete" buttons without using the grid
2. Safari - Mac Voice Control - to activate any part of the component, I have to use the grid.

**Additional testing needed**
1. Android - talkback

### Test ID: upload-invalid-filetype
**Purpose:**  
Verify accessible error messaging when uploading an invalid file type.

**WCAG:**  
- 3.3.1 Error Identification  
- 3.3.3 Error Suggestion  
- 4.1.3 Status Messages  

**Setup:**  
Navigate to a `va-file-input` configured with a file-type whitelist (e.g., PDF only). [Storybook story](https://file-input-focus-and-sr--65a6e2ed2314f7b8f98609d8.chromatic.com/iframe.html?globals=&id=uswds-va-file-input--accepts-only-specific-file-types&viewMode=story)

**Steps:**  
1. When the user drags a file type onto the UI that is not permitted.

**Note:** The only way to activate this state is to drag a file type that is not permitted onto it. When using the link in the component, most browsers do not allow you to select files that are not permitted.

**Expected Result:**  
- Then the file is not uploaded.  
- And an error message appears in the UI.  
- And screen readers announce the error message when it appears.  
- And focus is on the "Change file" button.

#### Actual behavior:

**Screen readers**
1. ✅ Chrome + VO: The error state of the Uploaded file UI appears. An error message appears below the file name. Focus is on the Change file button. The screen reader announces "Error. We do not accept .exstension files. Choose a new file."
2. ✅ Safari + VO: The error state of the Uploaded file UI appears. An error message appears below the file name. Until the user returns focus to the browser, the virtual cursor is on the viewport window of the browser, once the user returns focus to the browser, focus goes to the Change file button. The screen reader announces "We do not accept .exstension files. Choose a new file."
3. Safari + iOS + VO: Not testable as you cannot drag files in iOS
4. Chrome + iOS + VO: Not testable as you cannot drag files in iOS
5. ⁇ Firefox + JAWS: When dragging a file over, initially nothing happens until I focus the browser again. Visible focus is on the change file button. It seems like something starts to announce, but then something interrupts it and it starts reading the `<title>`. Once it reads the title (and more info about the browser) eventually it goes down to and announces "Error we do not accept extension files. Choose a new file"
6. ⁇ Firefox + NVDA: when dragging a file over, initially nothing happens until I focus the browser again. Visible focus is on the change file button. The page `<title>` is announced, followed by "Selected files. Error we do not accept mp4 files. Choose a new file."
7. ⁇ Edge + JAWS: When dragging a file over, focus goes to the browser, and the visual focus is on the change file button. However, it announces `<title>` first. And then eventually it will announce "Error we do not accept extension files. Choose a new file."
8. ⁇ Edge + NVDA: When dragging a file over, focus goes to the browser, and once the UI is updated, the file upload Input is announced first along with the hint text (Input accepts only specific file types". Then it announces "Clickable Change file. Error We do not accept .mp4 files. Choose a new file"

## 🧩 Edge Cases
- Uploading multiple files where only one is invalid  
- Very fast uploads not announcing changes properly  
- Very slow uploads requiring status messaging (“Uploading…”)  
- File name truncation not announced meaningfully  
- Errors disappearing without AT notification  
- Browser differences in file input focus handling  

---

## 🔁 Regression Tests
- Historically, VoiceOver sometimes fails to announce file-upload changes.  
- Some Windows AT versions mis-handle dynamic error messages.  
- Past issues around incorrect file-type instructions (bytes vs. megabytes).
