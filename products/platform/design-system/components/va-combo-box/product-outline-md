## Summary
A combo box helps users select an item from a large list of options. This component is useful in mobile apps for scenarios where users need to choose a single option from a list. 


  
## Purpose & Context
#### Space Efficiency
Mobile screens have limited space. A combo box allows users to select from many options without displaying all of them at once, saving valuable screen real estate compared to radio buttons or long lists.

#### Input Error Prevention
By restricting users to a predefined set of options, combo boxes prevent invalid or unexpected input, reducing data entry errors and improving data consistency.

#### Simplifying Complex Choices
When there are many possible choices (e.g., selecting a country, state, or category), a combo box organizes these options in a way that’s easy to browse and select, rather than overwhelming the user.

#### Workflow Streamlining
In forms and workflows, combo boxes speed up data entry by allowing users to quickly pick options instead of typing them out.
