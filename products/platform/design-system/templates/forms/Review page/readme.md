## Note
- The current review page is automatically generated by the forms library. Engineers have very little to do to construct the review page. So this project is more than just a design pattern, but also front end and back end code that may need to accompany the deisgns.

## Research
- [Past Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms/tree/main/Product/Review%20Page/Research)
- [Planned/Future research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms/tree/main/Product/Review%20Page/Research/2024-XX%20VFF%20Review%20Edit%20by%20Page)
  - Note: This is planned dedicated research around the review/editing flow of a form itself, not a side-artifact of other research goals.

## Timeline

**February - June 2024**
- Team worked on designs for review page project. Starting and stopping a couple of times for various other priorities.

**June 2024**
- Design intent was held June 13, 2024
- 2 Versions of the flow were presented
  - Hub & spoke (edit by Page): The review page would act like a hub and spoke. A user would click edit, go to edit the one page, and return to the review page to address any other edits.
  - Continuous edit: The review page would be a launching point for edits, if any edits made were tied to conditionals that required new answers to be given or edited, the user would be redirected to those questions first before returning to the review page.
- Design intent feedback was to try to minimize the amount of errors on a review page by using the continuous edit flow.

**August 2024**
- Confirmed with Matt Dingee on August 7 that we do not need to go through the experimental design process for this project
- Conversation with AEDP Team [DSVA Slack thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C044AGZFG2W/p1723050082885509)
- VFF Selected VA Form 20-10206 as the form to build with for prototyping and testing. This form has a variety of different component elements we would want to test for in a review page, and is relatively simple with few conditionals.

**October 2024**
- Met with Engineers and Matt to determine if we would develop for the hub hub & spoke, or continuous flows. Because of the effort of tracking routes, it was decided we would go the hub and spoke path for now. 
- Welcomed Beth aboard, and transferred UX project to Beth from Jeana
- Met with AEDP team and further discussed the review page and how prefill may work in conjunction. [AEDP/ VFF Meeting Canvas](https://dsva.slack.com/docs/T03FECE8V/F07QK01BE7J)
- Research plans were written for the VFF to conduct studies ([see folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms/tree/main/Product/Review%20Page/Research/2024-XX%20VFF%20Review%20Edit%20by%20Page))

**November 2024**
- AEDP uses version of review page in [research on prefill](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/715)
- VFF engineers points out efforts for coded prototype around 20 points - 1 dev on it would probably be 2 - 3 sprints-  testing with AT users will be after development work is complete
- VFF engineers points out development effort for entire work - 80 points of work ([Github issues](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20milestone%3A%22Review%20Page%20Development%22))
- November 20, 2024 - Review page project put on hold due to extreme level of effort and end of contract


## Next steps
1. Prepare figma designs for midpoint review, confirming with engineers they will be able to build towards that design
2. Engineering begin work on MVP for research
3. Schedule Midpoint review
4. Incorporate any necessary changes from midpoint into MVP
5. Schedule and conduct research
6. Synthesize research and iterate on designs
7. Finish Engineering
8. Staging Review
9. Remediate issues
10. Launch
