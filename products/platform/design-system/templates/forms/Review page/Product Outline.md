# Forms Review Page 

## **Description**
When completing any form on va.gov, the user is presented with a summary view on the last page (Review page) that allows them to edit sections of information. Having multiple Edit buttons on one page, with editable sections hidden by default in a collapsible accordion component, creates functional and accessibility-related issues. 

Issues are componded the more complex a form becomes as focus management, multiple assertive alerts are even more prevalent.

This task seeks to:
1. Reduce cognitive load on users wanting to review or change their answers after they've walked through an entire form flow.
2. Make it easier for users to edit or change answers
3. Build in accessible features so that any edit links and error states are accessible by default.



## **Product Outline**


## **High Level User Story**
- As a user who has filled out a form on VA.gov, I want to be able to review the answers I have submitted in the form.

- As a user who has filled out a form on VA.gov, I want to be able to easily change the answers I have submitted in the form. 

- As a team member who builds a form on VA.gov, I want to be able to generate a review page with minimal intervention on my part.


## **Hypothesis or Bet**

If we make this change then we expect to make editing of a an answer easier and more accessible.


## **Definition of done**
- Review page takes the user back to the place on the form to make an edit and click continue takes the user back to the review page with the updated edits.
