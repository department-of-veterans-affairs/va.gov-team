# Conversation Guide (part b)
This study is split into two parts:
- Part a: ~54 (6 cohorts, separated by age) non-AT/sighted Veterans will participate in remote, unmoderated first click testing using Optimal Workshop (Chalkmark).
- Part b: 4-5 assisted technology-using Veterans will participate in remote, moderated task-based usability testing using Zoom.

This is the conversation guide for part b.

## Intro - 5 minutes

- Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jaci/Beth and I also have some colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...  
- Today we're going to talk about updated designs for VA online forms.  
- Before we start, a few things I want to mention:  
   - This entire session should take about 30 minutes.   

- I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- You'll be interacting with a prototype in a demo environment. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.  
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.  

#### Observer consent
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay if my colleagues join us as observers during this session?
   - `IF NO` use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - `IF YES:` Admit observers and ask them to turn on cameras and briefly introduce themselves, then turn cameras back off to save bandwidth

#### Recording consent
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - Knowing this, **would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**


*Start recording.*
 - **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
 - **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**
- Today we're going to talk about about reviewing the information you have submitted in a form before you submit it to VA.

## Warm-up Questions  - 5 minutes

Before we go to the website, let’s start with some warm-up questions:
- Do you have experience with submitting VA Forms online?
   -    `IF YES`
        -   Can you remember a specific form you've filled out in the recent past?
        -   Have you done the forms completely online or have you downloaded PDFs to fill out?
   - `IF NO`
      - Do you ever fill out forms online on other websites?
      - Can you recall a past positive experience filling out a form online? Tell me about it.

## Tasks   

## First Task: [Navigate from review page to form page to correct a misspelled form response] - 5 minutes

- Imagine that you just finished filling out VA Form 20-10206. This form is called the Freedom of Information or Privacy Act Request because you would use it to request specific compensation or benefit records. Now that you've finished filling out the form, you are on the review page reviewing your answers before submitting. You see that your <x> is misspelled on the review page. Can you correct this spelling?
- [Yes] Show me how you would correct that misspelling.
- [No] What would you do? What if I told you that you could correct this misspelling before submitting the form? Where would you guess to select first if you had to guess.
- [If they get to page inside the form to edit] Did you end up where you expected? If not, where did you expect to end up?
- On a scale from 1-5, 1 being the easiest, how easy was this task do you think?
- On a scale from 1-5, 1 being the least confident, how confident are you that you did this task correctly?

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant try to or want to interact with the progress bar as a way to navigate back into the form?
- Did the participant successfully complete the task (yes/no)?

## Second Task: [Correct a misspelled form response and return to review page] - 5 minutes

- We're going to stay on this page. Please correct the misspelling we identified in the last task.
- Now what do you want to do?
- [Before they select anything to go to the next page] Before you select that option, could you tell me where you expect you will end up after selecting that option?
- [After landing on next page] Did you end up where you expected? If not, where did you expect to end up?
- On a scale from 1-5, 1 being the easiest, how easy was this task do you think?
- On a scale from 1-5, 1 being the least confident, how confident are you that you did this task correctly?

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant understanding when they've ended up back on the review page?
- Did the participant successfully complete the task (yes/no)?

## Third Task: [Identify & edit list and loop entry] - X minutes

- You see that the date is wrong in one of the claim exam details that you requested and need to change it from November 14, 2020 to August 14, 2020. Where would you select first to go and correct it?
- [After landing on next page] Did you end up where you expected? If not, where did you expect to end up?
- Please edit the claim exam detail from November 14, 2020 to August 14, 2020.
- Now what would you do?
- [Before they select anything to go to the next page] Before you select that option, could you tell me where you expect you will end up after selecting that option?
- [After landing on next page] Did you end up where you expected? If not, where did you expect to end up?
- On a scale from 1-5, 1 being the easiest, how easy was this task do you think?
- On a scale from 1-5, 1 being the least confident, how confident are you that you did this task correctly?

### Things to watch for:

- Did they expect to end up somewhere different after editing the list and loop entry than the task to correct the misspelling?
- Did the participant successfully complete the task (yes/no)?

## Fourth task: [Follow up on alert] 
- Now we're back on the review page. Can you tell if anything is different on the review page now from the last time we were on it?
- [If they don't notice anything different] Under the [x] section, there's an alert that wasn't there before.
- What is this alert telling you to do?
- Go ahead and complete that action that the alert is asking for.
- On a scale from 1-5, 1 being the easiest, how easy was this task do you think?
- On a scale from 1-5, 1 being the least confident, how confident are you that you did this task correctly?

### Things to watch for:

- Did they find the alert without assistance?
- Did the participant successfully complete the task (yes/no)?

## Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes

- Was 

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
