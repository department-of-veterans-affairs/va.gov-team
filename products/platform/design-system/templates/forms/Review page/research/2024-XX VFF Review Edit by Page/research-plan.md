# Research Plan for Veteran Facing Forms Team, Review Page, Fall 2024

## Background
In [numerous studies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms/tree/main/Product/Review%20Page/Research) new variations of the review page have been presented to users, but the work has never been completed or considered successful. In it's current state, the review page has numerous bugs that require re-architecting the entire page and flow. The page also has numerous 508 defects. And, as the VA Design System has evolved, there is a desire to practice the "one thing per page" principle in the editing process as well.

To that end, we are proposing a new variation of the review page that we call the "hub and spoke" model. Unlike previous studies, our prototype will allow users to edit the contents of a single form page back on the original form page, and after the edits are made, they will return to the review page. If there are conditional pages that are required based on those edits, the user will go to these new pages before returning to the review page. Previous studies have had users have to navigate through an entire chapter to edit a single page in a form flow.

In this study, we seek to understand how Veterans interact with the "hub and spoke" model of the review page, and what their expectations are in answering new questions they may encounter based on their edits.  We hope the results from the study will help inform a new design for the review page process that is usable, scalable, and accessible.

Particularly, we hope to
- Reduce cognitive load on users wanting to review or change their answers after they've walked through an entire form flow.
- Make it easier for users to edit or change answers.
- Build in accessible features so that any edit links and error states are accessible by default.

Participants will walk through a code prototype on staging.

### OCTO Priorities 

Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202024.md) does this research support? 

This research supports 2 of the 2024 OCTO Objectives: 
- Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.
- Our platforms are the best way to deliver products at VA.

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 

Since Veterans can submit forms with VA between 180 and 90 days before separating from the military, this work impacts the Veteran journey from serving, to getting out, and all the way to dying as survivors can also file forms on their own behalf. This work especially maps to the taking care of myself part of the Veteran journey.

Key moments this research touches in the Veteran journey are:

- Engaging VA to access benefits and services
- Finding additional sources of income
- Taking care of my health
- Taking care of my family
- Planning for longer term care
- Deciding how and where to be memorialized

## Research Goals	
What are you trying to learn from this research? 

1. Evaluate the effectiveness and value of the "hub and spoke" model for the form review process for sighted and non-sighted users.
2. Understand how Veterans want to interact with content on the review page they've already reviewed mid-form (File upload and list and loop)
3. Understand the Veteran expectation for answering new questions that may be required due to changing an answer during the review process.

### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

- We believe the results from the study will help inform review page template changes for all forms moving forward

### Research questions
#### GOAL 1: Evaluate the effectiveness and value of the "hub and spoke" model for the form review process for sighted and non-sighted users.
- Are Veterans disoriented when clicking an edit link loads a new page with their form answers in editable fields?
- Do Veterans understand or expect to return to the review page after editing a single page or do they have a different expectation for what will happen after editing a single page?

#### GOAL 2: Understand how Veterans want to interact with content on the review page they've already reviewed mid-form (File upload and list and loop)
- Do Veterans think their form data is incomplete when not all of the data from the form appears on the review page for file upload and list and loop?
- Do Veterans want to delete file uploads and list and loops from the review page or can they navigate back into an edit flow and do this successfully?
- Do Veterans try to interact with the progress bar as a way to navigate through the form in a non-linear way?

#### GOAL 3.  Understand the Veteran expectation for answering new questions that may be required due to changing an answer during the review process.
- Are Veterans frustrated or confused about error/alert messages they encounter on the review page to update subsequent form fields?
- Do Veterans successfully complete the task(s) the error/alert message(s) ask them to complete? 

### Hypothesis

1. We hypothesize that Veterans will be able to navigate with ease to edit/change their answers and will return to the review page.
2. We hypothesize that while not all form content is visible on the review page, Veterans will have enough context to understand where and how to review/change/edit all of the answers in a given form flow.
3. We hypothesize that Veterans will express some frustration or negative feelings when they encounter a slew of alert/error messages on the review page to update subsequent form fields as a result of the "hub and spoke" model.


## Methodology	
We'll conduct remote usability testing over Zoom using a coded prototype on staging. This method will enable us to observe sighted and non-sighted participants filling out a form and review and edit their responses. 

- Usability testing task analysis
- Post-task and post-testing participant questions

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach

- **Recruit one time for 2 distinct study parts**
  - Part 1: Non-AT users - recruit 12 total participants for a total of at least 8 completed sessions
  - Part 2: AT users - recruit 8 total participants for a total of at least 5 completed sessions
- Schedule a brief kickoff call to run through the recruitment criteria before recruiting.
