# First click testing tasks (part a)
This study is split into two parts:
- Part a: ~54 (6 cohorts, separated by age) non-AT/sighted Veterans will participate in remote, unmoderated first click testing using Optimal Workshop (Chalkmark).
- Part b: 4-5 assisted technology-using Veterans will participate in remote, moderated task-based usability testing using Zoom.

This is the documentation for part a. This study information will also be in Optimal Workshop. 

## Intro message 

- Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jeana and I also have some colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...  
- Today we're going to talk about updated designs for VA online forms.  
- Before we start, a few things I want to mention:  
   - `IF AT USER`: This entire session should take about 60 minutes.  
   - `IF NOT AT USER`: This entire session should take about 90 minutes.  

## First click tasks
Conversation guide will include full details with screenshots.
***Create 2-4 versions of these tasks so each can have their own “cohort”.

1. (Navigate to page to edit) You see that your <x> is misspelled on the review page. Where would you click first to go back to that page and correct the spelling?
2. (Go back to review page) Now that you’ve corrected your <x> spelling, where would you click to go back to the review page?
3. (List and loop task) You see that your period of service in the Navy has the wrong entry date. Where would you click first to go and correct it?
4.   a. (List and loop task: VA Form 21-10206) You see that the date is wrong in one of the claim exam details that you requested and need to change it from November 14, 2020 to August 14, 2020. Where would you click first to go and correct it?
5.   (Follow up on alert) You notice an alert on the review page. What would you click first to learn more?
6.   (Edit based on alert) What would you click on first to resolve this alert?
7.   Post-questions? (can only ask questions after all tasks, not after each task)

Rate how easy these tasks felt to complete. (1-5 scale)
Is any particular task or action you were asked to do confusing? Please describe.
(screenshot of alert they were shown) In the last task, you were asked to respond to an alert that was on the review page. Was it clear why that alert was there and what you needed to do in response?

1. Your task is to fill out VA Form 20-10206 and review your answers before submitting the form. As you complete the task, remember to think aloud, sharing your thoughts and experiences. Don't worry if you encounter any difficulties or confusion, these are important for us to know.

## Thank-You and Closing message

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
