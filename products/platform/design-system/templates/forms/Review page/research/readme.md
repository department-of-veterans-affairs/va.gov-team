  **Key findings**

  - 5 out of 6 Participants preferred Design Option #2 (Editing by field) for the following reasons: 
    - Visibility of information - always visible to review
    - Edit option - ability to edit individual data fields  
  - All participants preferred the Review page with the information always open so they can review the information with ease. 
  - 4 out of 6 participants preferred the editing individual fields instead of entire sections to avoid editing other fields by mistake. 
  - 2 out of 6 participants preferred to edit the entire section instead of individual data fields to edit entire section/multiple data fields at the same time thus saving time and effort. 
  - No participant interacted with anchors in the top of the page until prompted.  However, all participants valued the ability to easily get to a section from the top of the page.

  **Key findings**

  - Most Veterans found success faster with the Edit by Section design.
    - Veterans found that the Edit by Section design had better ease of navigation and ease of reviewing and updating entire sections.
    - Qualitatively, Veterans were also able to navigate and intuitively understand how to update the Edit by Section design better than the Edit by Field design.
  - Though nearly all Veterans understood how to save a change and return to the Review Page without explanation, nearly half of them expressed confusion or uncertainty regarding the meaning of the Save & Continue, Back, and Continue buttons.
  - When returning to the Review Page after saving a change, all Veterans preferred being anchored to the section they just updated with a persistent confirmation notification.

    The review pattern at the end of the application is easy-to-use when checking answers and making changes prior to submitting.
  
    Overall participants reacted favorably on the review page and were able to intuitively open, review and change their information as needed. There was one sugestion of being able to also upload their DD-214 on the review page.

  <summary>Decision Reviews - Notice of Disagreement</summary>
  
  - [Research - folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/decision-reviews/Notice-of-Disagreement/Research)
  - [Research readout - markdown](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/decision-reviews/Notice-of-Disagreement/Research/082023-NOD-Enhancement-Validation/research-findings.md)
  - [Prototype used for testing](https://staging.va.gov/decision-reviews/test-nod/review-then-submit)

    **Applicable findings**
      ### **Navigational and Task Flow Enhancements**
      Response to the enhanced review page was poor. Veterans were thrown off by being sent to the beginning of each section upon clicking on “edit” and expressed wanting to be able to edit responses to specific prompts directly. Upon making revisions, Veterans manually stepped through the form to return to the review page.

      **Note from Jeana:** The friction encountered here is because the edit link took the user back to the first page of the step, not the page. So the users were not sure where they would land when editing, and then had to walk through the entire form flow.
