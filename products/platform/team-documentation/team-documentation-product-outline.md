# Platform Documentation: Product Outline

## Overview

VSP stores team documents in a variety of places: va.gov-team repo, va.gov-team ZenHub board, and Google Suite. 

## Problem Statement

Each team's usage of the three locations varies. Because of this, DEPO leads, VSP leads, and teams themselves don't have easy insight into another team's work.

This results in frequent, high-touch, update-type communication across DEPO leads, VSP leads, and teams themselves.

_HMW use Confluence to lend consistency to VSP team documentation?_

## Personas
* DEPO leads
* VSP PMs
* VSP individual contributors

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* DEPO lead sentiment around clarity of team progress, at any given point in time
* PM sentiment around ease of documenting
* Individual contributor sentiment around documentation navigation

#### Baseline KPI Values
- n/a

## Assumptions

* Building out Confluence will lead to greater self-service and fewer support requests.
* Confluence will be easier for VFS teams to navigate and surface the resources they are looking for.
* The VSP team will be able to customize Confluence without undue burden.
 
## Solution Approach
This quarter (2020 Q4), the Content/IA team is running a pilot to identify how VFS developers prioritize and group tasks, in order to develop an IA that is easily navigable.

With the pilot, we can establish a process of uncovering and understanding VFS developers' task/categorization association, and apply this process to tasks that other practitioners perform.
