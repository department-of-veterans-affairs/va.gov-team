# Test User Account Dashboard Product Outline

## Overview

The Test User Account Dashboard is a tool that will make it easier for testers to find the right test account for a user scenario and will ensure the state of those accounts can be easily managed and maintained.


## Problem Statement
VSP does not have a scalable solution for the challenges teams face with test user accounts while performing tests and demos on VA.gov.  Currently, testers cannot find test user accounts that are viable for the scenarios they need.  Test user accounts regularly have inaccurate data, expired passwords, used by multiple testers, and are not in the right state to test a feature.

## Personas

* VSP Engineers
* VFS Developers

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

* Reduction on time to find a test user account to QA a new test case
* Reduced # of questions about how to find a test user account
* Increase # of QA tests being fully executed with test user accounts

More KPIs TBD...

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics, if possible._

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

_Describe, in a few sentences and/or bullet points, what you plan to build, and how it will solve the problem. Some questions to think about:_

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

_For non-trivial technical solutions, an [engineering design doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/engineering/design-docs) should be written to deeply explain **How** this product will be built._
