## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Ian and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about methods of giving feedback, like complaints or compliments, for the tools and services found on VA.gov.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

## Set Up - 5 minutes

In order to get the most out of this session, I would like to be able to see your screen. Can you let me know what kind of device you’re using, laptop/desktop or a mobile device?

**If desktop participant**

- Talk them through Zoom screen sharing and chat features

**If mobile participant**

- First I want to make sure your technology is ready to go for this session. Can you confirm for me what type of device you're using to join today?
``` This looks like a dupe of earlier question ``` 

*For iPhone:*

- When you are inside the zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. Audio, Video, Share content, Participants, and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share content." Any questions?
- Tap ‘Share content’ (Green button at bottom middle of the screen)
- Tap on Screen
- Tap Zoom
- Tap start broadcast. After a count of 3, the entire device screen will be shared into the meeting
- Tap the red bar at the top of your screen when you are ready to end the share
- Great, now I can see your phone screen! I'm going to begin now if that's ok with you. We will return to this in a few moments. For troubleshooting screen sharing in iOS, reference the Zoom documentation here https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005890803-iOS-Screen-Sharing

*For Android:*

- When you are inside the zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. For instance, Share and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share." Any questions?
- Tap "Share"
- Tap "Screen"
- May give a "sensitive info" alert
- May ask you to give Zoom permission to display over other apps, toggle yes. The hit the back arrow . Then it might just share your screen.
- Tap "Start now" (maybe) For Android troubleshooting, try here: https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen

**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

**Recording Instructions**

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - *If yes:* Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

**Start recording.**

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?"

Great. Now we're really ready to begin!

## Warm-up Questions - 7 minutes

```Recommend restructuring some of the questions in this section as follows (your original questions and comments are below).```

- Are you aware of any options that va.gov offers for providing feedback on the website?
  - if YES: 
    - Can you describe which options you are aware of? 
    - Have you ever used any of these options?
    - Why / why not? 
      - If YES to submitting feedbacK: How did you figure out how to submit the feedback? 
      - Were you able to submit the feedback you wanted to submit? 

  - if NO: 
    - Can you describe a situation in which you might want to submit feedback to VA.gov?

------
- Have you ever submitted feedback regarding your experience on the VA.gov website?
```Are you looking for them to tell you if they have used the feedback tool on va.gov, or if they have ever submitted feedback on website problems anywhere? The specific phrasing on this question may get you more answers for the latter. Consider rephrasing or using a series of questions to get to this answer.``` 

e.g. " If yes: Tell me which options you're aware of? Have you ever used any of these options? Why or why not?; if No: ... continue```
  - *If yes:* Can you tell me about the experience of submitting feedback?
    - Was it easy to figure out how to submit feedback?
    ```You're priming them to say that they thought it was easy.```
    - Were you able to accurately provide the feedback you were looking to provide?
    ```What are you trying to answer with this question? It's a bit wordy and confusing. My read on it is that you're asking Veterans if they were able to tell VA what they wanted to tell VA about the problem they experienced.```
  - *If no:* Would you be able to walk us through reasons, if there any, for not submitting feedback?
  
- Can you describe a situation in which you would feel compelled to submit feedback?
------

    
## First Task: Feedback Survey - 7 minutes

I’m going to send a link to a specific page in the chat.

*Send the link to the* [*Find VA Locations*](https://staging.va.gov/find-locations/) *page in the chat.*

**Task: You would like to submit feedback on this Find VA Locations page on the VA.gov website. What would be your process for submitting that feedback?**
```I recommend not using hypotheticals.```

As you’re performing this task, please talk us through your thoughts as you interact with the site.

### Things to watch for:

- Were they able to find the form and open it?

*If they find the form and open it:* Ok great! Can you leave this form open while I ask a few follow up questions? You don’t need to fill it out or submit it.

### Follow-up Questions

- On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form. 
```Why I'm recommending this change: When you say "how easy was this" you are priming them to say it was easy. Give them the option to say its hard.```
  - Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form? 
- What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?
```Again, give them the opportunity to ask questions. They almost always have one, but when you ask if they have any, Veterans frequently go into "pleaser" mode and say 'NO.' ``` 
- Which questions do you think could be clarified?
- Would you, personally, fill out this form?
  - *If yes:* Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?

## Second Task: Intercept Survey - 5 minutes

I’m going to send another link to a specific page in the chat.

*Send the link to the* [*West Los Angeles VA Medical Center*](https://staging.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vha_691) *page in the chat.*

When you opened this page, did a form overlay on top of the page?
```You may want to have another way of describing this.``` 

- *If no:* Can you please try refreshing the page?
- *If yes:* Great! 

**Task: How would you go about providing feedback on this page? Again, once you locate the form, you do not need to fill it out and submit it.**

As you’re performing this task, please talk us through your thoughts as you interact with the site.

### Things to watch for:

- Were they able to find the “Provide Feedback” button on the intercept survey?

*If they successfully locate and click on the “Provide Feedback” button:* Ok great! Can you leave this form open while I ask a few follow up questions?

### Follow-up Questions

- On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form. 
```Why I'm recommending this change: When you say "would you say this was easy" you are priming them to say it was easy. Give them the option to say its hard.```
- - Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form? 
- What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?
```Again, give them the opportunity to ask questions. They almost always have one, but when you ask if they have any, Veterans frequently go into "pleaser" mode and say 'NO.' ``` 
- Take a moment to review all the questions on the survey. Are there any questions you don’t understand or need clarification on?
- Would you, personally, fill out this survey?
  - *If yes:* Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?

## Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes

That’s it for the tasks, but I have a few general questions in reference to both of these forms?

- Do you feel comfortable or confident submitting this feedback form?
```pick one - comfortable or confident --- i recommend confident.``` 
- Have there been any instances or experiences you’ve had on VA.gov that would cause you to want to provide feedback?
```plain language```
- Who or what organization do you think is responsible for submitting this feedback form?
```I don't understand this question. Revise.```
- What do you think happens after you submit feedback?

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
