## Warm-up Questions - 7 minutes

*   Are you aware of any options that va.gov offers for providing feedback on the website?
    *   If **NO**:
        *   Can you describe a situation in which you might want to submit feedback to VA.gov?
            *   Yes. When it comes to CLAIMS… had to see their recommended doctor, took months, needed info for appeal… was taking too long. Also, if I encountered rude people, would it bring up in feedback

## First Task: Feedback Survey

Task: You would like to submit feedback on this Find VA Locations page on the VA.gov website. What would be your process for submitting that feedback? Would call… encounter with the education section, called to say the site wasn’t working… called regular VA number, explained issue, was routed to another number, which gave her yet another number to call… went up chain of command, but resolved issue another way.


### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the form and open it?
    *   No. Oh, contact us up top…  when “feedback button” was mentioned, user saw button on right


### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.
    *   1 difficult to find… 
    *   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?
        *   wouldn't’ have seen if not prompted… not on top or bottom of page, wouldn’t think to look at right-hand side… not easy to see, small
*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?
    *   none, it’s really simple
*   Which questions do you think could be clarified?
    *   No clarifications, would add a character limit counter or notification
*   Would you, personally, fill out this form?
    *   If I can see button easier, yes, I’d fill this out
    *   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?
        *   Used va.gov on phone and desktop, plus laptop… more likely to use on mobile

## Post-Task Interview

That’s it for the tasks, but I have a few general questions in reference to both of these forms.

*   Do you feel confident submitting these feedback forms?
    *   Not confident to submit-- never know if someone is looking, or just compiling emails
*   Have there been any experiences you’ve had on VA.gov that would cause you to want to provide feedback?
    *   No, not lately
*   Who do you think is responsible for creating this feedback form?
    *   VA
*   What do you think happens after you submit feedback?
    *   Should go to IT dept, be assigned and resolved
*   Would move button to the top by sign-in (in the blue area) - depending on issue, make form so that it takes in user’s name and email as an optional contact back
