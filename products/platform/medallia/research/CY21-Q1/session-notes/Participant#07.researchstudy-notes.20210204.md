## Warm-up Questions - 7 minutes

*   Are you aware of any options that va.gov offers for providing feedback on the website?
    *   If NO: Not for feedback, but I do go on the site
        *   Can you describe a situation in which you might want to submit feedback to VA.gov?
            *   No… at one time, I called in because my password wasn’t acting right, wouldn’t take; thinking about it, I’d like to be able to follow up if it takes VA too long to get back to me after I’ve filed a problem/complaint

## First Task: Feedback Survey

Task: You would like to submit feedback on this Find VA Locations page on the VA.gov website. What would be your process for submitting that feedback? Call 1-800-698-2411 number for VA (411) … have ordered prescriptions online, contacted primary care, but nothing for general VA.gov site problems- never clicked anything for support issues… would scroll down to bottom to look for feedback/help area


### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the form and open it?
    *   didn’t click it, didn’t mention seeing it until prompted 


### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.
    *   No number given… but 
    *   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?
        *    doesn’t think it would supply quick response (within 48 hours) because similar buttons on other sites don’t; that’s why he relies on calling in
*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?
    *   No questions
*   Which questions do you think could be clarified?
    *   what task were you trying to do today? Change wording to be more specific to what he needs
*   Would you, personally, fill out this form?
    *   I’d fill it out, if it generates a quicker response
    *   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?
        *   Laptop

## Comparative Analysis

**Medallia "Vanilla" Button**

*   Can you describe for me the differences between this button and the previous button?
    *   Lighter button - saw color change, change of letter direction… 
*   Would you describe this button as better or worse than the previous button?
    *   likes this one more than previous, color stands out more
*   Follow up: Can you explain your answer?
    *   But… wishes there was a chat button over a feedback button

**Comparative Ranking**

*   Which of these two buttons are you most likely to click on?
    *   Button b (old button) if the message symbol indicated chat. Since it doesn’t, button a (lighter blue button)

## Post-Task Interview

That’s it for the tasks, but I have a few general questions in reference to both of these forms.

*   Do you feel confident submitting these feedback forms?
    *   Doesn’t feel comfortable  or confident with a feedback button, not expecting a timely response… it’s why he calls. Beneficial to Veterans if there was a human chat agent connected to feedback button… don’t know if they’re being heard otherwise
*   Have there been any experiences you’ve had on VA.gov that would cause you to want to provide feedback?
    *   Be a good tool if you got a response… form doesn’t mention any kind of turnaround time, doesn’t ask for personal details… feels it isn’t worth his time, calling and speaking to someone is better
*   Who do you think is responsible for creating this feedback form?
    *   Tended to refer to the VA organization throughout, seems to infer it here
*   What do you think happens after you submit feedback?
    *   After submit, “into the trash can”... feedback, someone should monitor and respond… never got a positive response in my experience… doesn’t seem to be VA’s priority
*   Doesn’t know if feedback knows who he is… wouldn’t generate personal response… not just a coronavirus issue, is organizational
