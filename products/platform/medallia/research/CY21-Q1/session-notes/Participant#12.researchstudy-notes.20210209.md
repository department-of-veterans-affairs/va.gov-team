## Warm-up Questions - 7 minutes

*   Are you aware of any options that va.gov offers for providing feedback on the website?
    *   If YES:
        *   Can you describe which options you are aware of?
            *   Down at the bottom of the page, the contact us section.
            *   Have you ever used any of these options?
            *   No, but I probably should
        *   Why / why not?
            *   Mainly because I don’t know how much attention my feedback would get; don’t usually do that kind of thing
            *   If YES to submitting feedback: How did you figure out how to submit the feedback?
                *   I’d have to find the link to leave comments, but it probably won’t hook me up either \
I have placed phone calls so that there’s no misinterpretation… I would email if I had an address and thought someone would read it
            *   Were you able to submit the feedback you wanted to submit?
                *    I discovered a change in rating, so I went in to apply for life insurance, and the website wasn’t helpful… seemed to take forever, maybe my connection is slow… planning to go do this in person

## First Task: Feedback Survey

Task: You would like to submit feedback on this Find VA Locations page on the VA.gov website. What would be your process for submitting that feedback? Go down to Contact Us and click on that


### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the form and open it?
    *   … I guess there’s a feedback button on the right and I’d click that


### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.
    *   Never noticed before… 5 “now that I see it”... blue against the white stands out
    *   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?
        *   Looks pretty straightforward… 
*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?
    *   None
*   Which questions do you think could be clarified?
    *   Could add a dropdown box for something more specific
*   Would you, personally, fill out this form?
    *   I would, now that I know it’s there. I will.
    *   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?
        *   Phone

## Comparative Analysis

**Medallia "Vanilla" Button**

*   Can you describe for me the differences between this button and the previous button?
    *   Lighter blue, smaller print (would like type larger). Doesn’t get lost in the blue like the darker button, though.
*   Would you describe this button as better or worse than the previous button?
    *   Color is better, font size is worse (too small)
*   Follow up: Can you explain your answer?
    *   (see above)

**Comparative Ranking**

*   Which of these two buttons are you most likely to click on?
    *   Darker button is better, I’d use that

## Post-Task Interview

That’s it for the tasks, but I have a few general questions in reference to both of these forms.

*   Do you feel confident submitting these feedback forms?
    *   Yes, but will someone respond?
*   Have there been any experiences you’ve had on VA.gov that would cause you to want to provide feedback?
    *   The life insurance issue I mentioned. Can’t get in to fill out the forms.
*   Who do you think is responsible for creating this feedback form?
    *   Some IT persons at VA gather the info, forward to appropriate departments
*   What do you think happens after you submit feedback?
    *   Goes to a centralized department, gets filtered out by topic, if it’s an IT issue, etc. I don’t see them changing for one comment, but if things pile up, perhaps change would occur. They have too much information on the page and it takes too long to load as it is. Times out too often. Maybe it’s my browser issue, but other pages seem to work fine.
*   I’m glad we spoke, because now I know the button is there and I’ll look for it. But if there are issues, I know I can always call.
