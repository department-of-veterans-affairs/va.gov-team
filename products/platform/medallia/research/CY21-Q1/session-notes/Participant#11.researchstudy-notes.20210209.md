## Warm-up Questions - 7 minutes

*   Are you aware of any options that va.gov offers for providing feedback on the website?
    *   If NO:  Not too sure about that… don’t think I’ve encountered an opportunity… have  done one-on-one discussion with people re. feedback, in person
        *   Can you describe a situation in which you might want to submit feedback to VA.gov?
            *   Today, I was scheduled for an appointment in March, and I happened to see on VA.gov that I’d been cancelled, and hadn't received  notice. So I called and was able to resolve the issue.

## First Task: Feedback Survey

Task: You would like to submit feedback on this Find VA Locations page on the VA.gov website. What would be your process for submitting that feedback? (Share his experience) - I would capture a screenshot of where I’m having an issue, and I would use email. (On this page)... down at bottom, use “Call us” or “Contact us”... I don’t see another that would make sense. 


### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the form and open it?
    *   There’s an “unobvious… Facebook link” on the side… it’s sitting sideways on one side, doesn’t make it obvious


### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.
    *   3 or 4
    *   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?
        *   I was able to find multiple ways of communicating… placement of button, being sideways, not obvious that I’d use it to contact VA
*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?
    *   Doesn’t tell me whether it’s going to VA… going to Facebook?
*   Which questions do you think could be clarified?
    *   Would title the form across the top, like “Feedback to VA”
*   Would you, personally, fill out this form?
    *   Sure
    *   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?
        *   Desktop

## Comparative Analysis

**Medallia "Vanilla" Button**

*   Can you describe for me the differences between this button and the previous button?
    *   It’s more difficult to ascertain… can’t read it all that well. Not easier to find.
*   Would you describe this button as better or worse than the previous button?
    *   Worse… 
*   Follow up: Can you explain your answer?
    *   color is the same as the water on the U.S. map; darkness of word feedback is hard to read

**Comparative Ranking**

*   Which of these two buttons are you most likely to click on?
    *   The darker blue button

## Post-Task Interview

That’s it for the tasks, but I have a few general questions in reference to both of these forms.

*   Do you feel confident submitting these feedback forms?
    *   I don’t know why I wouldn’t
*   Have there been any experiences you’ve had on VA.gov that would cause you to want to provide feedback?
    *   Nothing at the moment, aside from the scheduling problem I mentioned before; when I did contact them, they were “very, very good.”
*   Who do you think is responsible for creating this feedback form?
    *   I’d assume the facility I’m trying to contact is responsible. But VA is so huge, you never know...
*   What do you think happens after you submit feedback?
    *   Don’t know… there’s no indication in the form… wouldn’t like it to tell me what to expect.

Only thing I’d add, since VA is so huge, sometimes things get lost. It would be nice if there was something specific to guide me… like “if you don’t hear from us in XXX time,” it gives an alternate form of contact.
