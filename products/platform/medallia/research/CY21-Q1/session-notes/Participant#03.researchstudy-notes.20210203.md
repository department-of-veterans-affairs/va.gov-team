## Warm-up Questions - 7 minutes

*   Are you aware of any options that va.gov offers for providing feedback on the website?
    *   **NO**
    *   Can you describe a situation in which you might want to submit feedback to VA.gov?
    *   **If having trouble using a site like VA.gov, I would look for the Contact Us tab. Have used help options on various websites.**

## First Task: Feedback Survey

Task: You would like to submit feedback on this Find VA Locations page on the VA.gov website. What would be your process for submitting that feedback? 

**I see the Contact Us tab at the top, and would use that. Would use the open box at bottom, expand to see what I can do to send info. Would use email for contact.**


### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the form and open it?
    *   Doesn’t easily see anything specific that would send info to VA for help; didn’t see feedback button until prompted.


### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.
    *   Scale: experience finding - 5 blue stuck out as I was scrolling past (post-prompting)
    *   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?
        *   Feedback button - questions about filling out - no questions about them, seems clear for 3 questions they’re asking
*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?
    *    - no clarification needed
*   Which questions do you think could be clarified?
    *   none
*   Would you, personally, fill out this form?
    *   If I got the info I needed, I wouldn’t fill out; but if I didn’t, I would fill out, but doesn’t feel it really helps him (doesn’t provide him with an instant solution)
    *   Form seems too general, won’t help him find a facility, etc - wants more specific form - perhaps an interactive form that leads him to right link
    *   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?
        *   NA

## Comparative Analysis

**Medallia "Vanilla" Button**

*   Can you describe for me the differences between this button and the previous button?
    *   Lighter blue button - about the same in terms of being able to easily find, compared with darker button… In post-discussion, we notice user didn’t seem to react to the different orientation of the word in the button
*   Would you describe this button as better or worse than the previous button?
    *   about the same

**Comparative Ranking**

*   Which of these two buttons are you most likely to click on?
    *   Side-by-side, prefers darker button w/message symbol

## Post-Task Interview

That’s it for the tasks, but I have a few general questions in reference to both of these forms.

*   Do you feel confident submitting these feedback forms?
    *   Feels confident about filling out and submitting
*   Have there been any experiences you’ve had on VA.gov that would cause you to want to provide feedback?
    *   Using over the past year, pretty user friendly, nothing comes to mind… much better than previous years
*   Who do you think is responsible for creating this feedback form?
    *    VA IT dept, or subcontractor
*   What do you think happens after you submit feedback?
    *   After submit, goes to whoever is handling formatting of that page
    *   Wouldn’t use form, too generic, would keep looking to find info he needed elsewhere
    *   Form should be more specific to the page he’s on
    *   Was I able to complete task- no-give me other option to find VA resource… another option to clarify what I wasn’t able to do… a way to more specifically help him accomplish his task
