## First Task: Feedback Survey

Task: You would like to submit feedback on this Find VA Locations page on the VA.gov website. What would be your process for submitting that feedback? If he experienced technical issues, he informed that he would call.


### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the form and open it?
    *   Yes.
    *   He found the button within 10 seconds.


### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.
    *   5, he informed us that it would be easier if it were horizontal and possibly yellow.
    *   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?
        *   5 Rating
*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?
    *   He didn’t like the questions that were offered.
*   Which questions do you think could be clarified?
    *   He informed us that it seems “pretty clear.”
*   Would you, personally, fill out this form?
    *   No, he doesn’t feel that the feedback would lead to an answer to his questions.  He would prefer that the “Feedback” have an email field where he would be contacted.
    *   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?
        *   Take notes here
