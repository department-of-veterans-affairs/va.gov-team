## Warm-up Questions - 7 minutes

*   Are you aware of any options that va.gov offers for providing feedback on the website?
    *   If NO: x Sure they do, don’t know where
        *   Can you describe a situation in which you might want to submit feedback to VA.gov?
            *   About the VA, there are a few, don’t know if they’ll do anything about it… I’d use a feedback form, or email, give them backstory… would use digital means only, wouldn’t call, too hard to get someone - too many transfers… left messages, haven’t gotten return calls, rescheduling appointments is very difficult

## First Task: Feedback Survey

Task: You would like to submit feedback on this Find VA Locations page on the VA.gov website. What would be your process for submitting that feedback? Use the feedback button on right 


### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the form and open it?
    *   (saw quickly)... but first inclination is to scroll down to footer for contact us or feedback


### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.
    *   Said 4… but found it very fast… 
    *   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?
        *   your eye doesn’t really go to it
*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?
    *   Straightforward
*   Which questions do you think could be clarified?
    *   Last question, make it more specific than an overall site review… make it more specific to the page on wh;ich the button appears
*   Would you, personally, fill out this form?
    *   Probably not. Don’t see the point. Won’t go out of my way. Don’t know if VA will act on it.
    *   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?

## Comparative Analysis

**Medallia "Vanilla" Button**

*   Can you describe for me the differences between this button and the previous button?
    *   Stands out more (colors, button and font)
*   Would you describe this button as better or worse than the previous button?
    *   Better in that it pops, 
*   Follow up: Can you explain your answer?
    *   But it also doesn’t seem to fit the site design, so maybe worse aesthetically

**Comparative Ranking**

*   Which of these two buttons are you most likely to click on?
    *   Likes aesthetics of darker button, but not sure it does a better job than the teal button; re text direction, the bottom to top seems more natural to me

## Post-Task Interview

That’s it for the tasks, but I have a few general questions in reference to both of these forms.

*   Do you feel confident submitting these feedback forms?
    *   Yeah
*   Have there been any experiences you’ve had on VA.gov that would cause you to want to provide feedback?
    *   Yes, but don’t know if I’d do it. Probably should. Talking about logging in and getting into a weird loop with account settings (old vs. new version of website?)... was trying to check my disability, wasn’t very intuitive
*   Who do you think is responsible for creating this feedback form?
    *   Assuming VA IT, or a contractor
*   What do you think happens after you submit feedback?
    *   Some report is generated, VA skims through to see what’s valuable and what isn’t.
*   It’s a simple form; shouldn’t be made any more complicated than it is.
