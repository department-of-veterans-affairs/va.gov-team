## Warm-up Questions - 7 minutes

*   Are you aware of any options that va.gov offers for providing feedback on the website?
    *   If NO: x… something at the bottom? Or a popup “Would you like to take a survey?”
        *   Can you describe a situation in which you might want to submit feedback to VA.gov?
            *   No… something would have to really go wrong… folks who do surveys are either really  pleased or really upset

## First Task: Feedback Survey

Task: You would like to submit feedback on this Find VA Locations page on the VA.gov website. What would be your process for submitting that feedback? Scroll down… would use contact us link, would expect to see phone numbers… I like calling and speaking to an actual person, explaining the error I’m running into. Saw contact us at top


### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the form and open it?
    *   Wasn’t seeing the button at first… saw for a moment but moved on to other areas. Prompting led her to it; seemed as though she thought  it was funny she’d overlooked


### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.
    *   1 - “if it was a snake, it would have bit me”
    *   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?
        *    blended in on the side, didn’t stand out
*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?
    *   Wondering if it’s going to ask for contact info on “the next screen” … option for contact should be right there
*   Which questions do you think could be clarified?
    *   Questions seem fine, maybe number rating isn’t specific enough
*   Would you, personally, fill out this form?
    *   If I had an issue, I’d use it. It’s short! If it asked me in an optional way, I’d say no
    *   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?
        *   Phone, because I’d be on it already

## Comparative Analysis

**Medallia "Vanilla" Button**

*   Can you describe for me the differences between this button and the previous button?
    *   Told that button is different… word turned other way works better in her opinion
*   Would you describe this button as better or worse than the previous button?
    *   Better for word direction… phone is in dark mode

**Comparative Ranking**

*   Which of these two buttons are you most likely to click on?
    *   First one (dark blue with word bubble)... second one is bottom to top, but first button looks better in that the blue shade matches the rest of the page

## Post-Task Interview

That’s it for the tasks, but I have a few general questions in reference to both of these forms.

*   Do you feel confident submitting these feedback forms?
    *   Sure, yeah… maybe give the option for contact information, but make it optional… who’s going to be the person to reach out on complaints?
*   Have there been any experiences you’ve had on VA.gov that would cause you to want to provide feedback?
    *   Not particularly… 
*   Who do you think is responsible for creating this feedback form?
    *   A web developer creates, 
*   What do you think happens after you submit feedback?
    *   but as for the data, probably cyber analytics contractors process, then let VA run wild with it
