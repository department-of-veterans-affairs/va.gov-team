## Warm-up Questions - 7 minutes

*   Are you aware of any options that va.gov offers for providing feedback on the website?
    *   If **NO**:
        *   Can you describe a situation in which you might want to submit feedback to VA.gov?
            *   Used/aware of VA.gov options for providing feedback? Uses MHV website… have made comments about great care from doctors at local med center… 2x last 6 mos, positive feedback
            *   Other situations where you’d want to provide feedback on any VA website? Was looking for COVID-19 vaccination info, lots of very good info, signed up for newsletter, got first shot, 2nd one coming up… can’t think of a feedback reason, other than MHV… had trouble finding something that was pointed out in a newsletter, asked about where information was located, isn’t sure how he went about asking (months ago)...
            *   Veteran’s view of page was broken...interviewer had to share his

## First Task: Feedback Survey

Task: You would like to submit feedback on this Find VA Locations page on the VA.gov website. What would be your process for submitting that feedback? Would click on Contact Us at top (assuming he’s signed in)... would do that and see what choices he has… depending upon urgency of need, or just wondering… would probably chat and then call if options were there… random questions would be emailed… 


### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the form and open it?
    *   Didn’t see button until told where it is (on the right)... user said a lot of times that will pop up on other sites (shopping sites, etc), think they want to do a survey… would only do that on other sites if he had time, but tries to ignore…


### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.
    *   didn’t find (ignored?) 2… difficult… 
    *   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?
        *   didn’t realize it was there to file a complaint… 2 because of his own inability to focus on what he felt were extraneous items… seemed like an extraneous item… because very often it comes up with “monkey surveys” (MailChimp?)... now that he knows it’s there on VA.gov, will use in the future
*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?
    *   None - no clarification on what’s there needed -
*   Which questions do you think could be clarified?
    *    but if that’s all there is, doesn’t seem like it would generate the type of contact he’d need … 
*   Would you, personally, fill out this form?
    *   kind of button he generally would never use; … questions seems like a general survey, not a help form with more specific questions… but would fill it out
    *   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?
        *   Would fill out on desktop or phone

## Comparative Analysis

**Medallia "Vanilla" Button**

*   Can you describe for me the differences between this button and the previous button?
    *   Not any easier to find, only because it had been pointed out
*   Would you describe this button as better or worse than the previous button?
    *   New, lighter blue button seems smaller, maybe harder to notice
*   Follow up: Can you explain your answer?
    *   Take notes here

**Comparative Ranking**

*   Which of these two buttons are you most likely to click on?
    *   Side-by-side, the larger dark blue with message bubble preferred

## Post-Task Interview

That’s it for the tasks, but I have a few general questions in reference to both of these forms.

*   Do you feel confident submitting these feedback forms?
    *   Confident submitting feedback form? Yes, although doesn’t know if he’d ever hear anything… not confident in response… would have to be a lot of people making same complaint for VA to notice… wouldn’t expect to hear anything based on these questions 
*   Have there been any experiences you’ve had on VA.gov that would cause you to want to provide feedback?
    *   compliment to his doctor, wouldn’t use this form… would use MHV… would expect no response on this form
*   Who do you think is responsible for creating this feedback form?
    *    VA, or people they contract to maintain the site
*   What do you think happens after you submit feedback?
    *   Goes into big pile, data-wise, impersonal
    *   No other questions… very rare he’d use feedback unless something was outstanding or very horrible
