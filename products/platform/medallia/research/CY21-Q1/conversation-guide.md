## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Ian and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about methods of giving feedback, like complaints or compliments, for the tools and services found on VA.gov.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 20-30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

## Set Up - 5 minutes

In order to get the most out of this session, I would like to be able to see your screen. What device would like to use today; laptop/desktop, tablet, mobile device?

**If desktop participant**

- Talk them through Zoom screen sharing and chat features

**If mobile participant**

*For iPhone:*

- When you are inside the zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. Audio, Video, Share content, Participants, and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share content." Any questions?
- Tap ‘Share content’ (Green button at bottom middle of the screen)
- Tap on Screen
- Tap Zoom
- Tap start broadcast. After a count of 3, the entire device screen will be shared into the meeting
- Tap the red bar at the top of your screen when you are ready to end the share
- Great, now I can see your phone screen! I'm going to begin now if that's ok with you. We will return to this in a few moments. For troubleshooting screen sharing in iOS, reference the Zoom documentation here https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005890803-iOS-Screen-Sharing

*For Android:*

- When you are inside the zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. For instance, Share and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share." Any questions?
- Tap "Share"
- Tap "Screen"
- May give a "sensitive info" alert
- May ask you to give Zoom permission to display over other apps, toggle yes. The hit the back arrow . Then it might just share your screen.
- Tap "Start now" (maybe) For Android troubleshooting, try here: https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen

**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

**If participant is using assistive technology, ask them:**
- As you are tabbing through to get to your screen share, before you reach that there should be an opption to "share computer audio." Can you enable that for me? That way we can hear your assistive tech read out.

**Recording Instructions**

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - *If yes:* Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

**Start recording.**

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?"

Great. Now we're really ready to begin!

## Task: Feedback Survey - 7 minutes

I’m going to send a link to a specific page in the chat. Could you pull up the link, then come back to zoom and share your screen? **NOTE: ASK THEM TO MINIMIZE THE PARTICIPANT WINDOW**

*If desktop:*

- Send the link to the [Find VA Locations Figma Desktop Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/lsPZXCv84TS5EwTjXobeHS/Medallia-Desktop?node-id=1%3A3&viewport=204%2C772%2C0.25&scaling=min-zoom&hotspot-hints=0&hide-ui=1) in the chat.

*If mobile:*

- Send the link to the [Find VA Locations Figma Mobile Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/KufrI4EbR1Y0it1xTgJaXj/Medallia-Mobile?node-id=1%3A2&viewport=1039%2C676%2C1&scaling=scale-down-width&hotspot-hints=0&hide-ui=1) in the chat.

**Task: Let's say you are trying to use this Find VA locations page, but you're experiencing an issue (maybe the map isn't showing results or it's pulling up the wrong area). What would you do to let someone know about this issue? (OR: If you wanted to share your experience about the task you were trying to complete, how would you do that?)**
 - **If they mention that they would email or call, ask if there is anything on this page that they could use.**

As you’re performing this task, please talk us through your thoughts as you interact with the site.

### Things to watch for:

- Were they able to find the form and open it?

*If they find the form and open it:* Ok great! Can you leave this form open while I ask a few follow up questions? You don’t need to fill it out or submit it.

### Follow-up Questions

- On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form. 
  - Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form? 
- What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?
- Which questions do you think could be clarified?
- Would you, personally, fill out this form?
  - *If yes:* Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?

## Comparative Analysis - 5 Minutes

**Medallia "Vanilla" Button**
*Send the link to the [Find VA Locations (Staging)](https://staging.va.gov/find-locations/) page*

**This is the same page as before, but with an alternate feedback button design.**

- Would you describe this button as better or worse than the previous button?
  - *Follow up:* Can you explain your answer?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

That’s it for the tasks, but I have a few general questions in reference to both of these forms.

- Do you feel confident submitting these feedback forms?
- Who do you think is responsible for creating this feedback form?
- What do you think happens after you submit feedback?
- Have there been any experiences you’ve had on VA.gov that would cause you to want to provide feedback?

## Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
