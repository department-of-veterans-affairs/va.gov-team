# Research Plan for VSP, Medallia, 2020

## Goals

This study is being conducted by the VSP team (Analytics and Insights; Contact Centers). The study follows the user feedback tool called Medallia, which is a Veteran Experience Office product within the VSignals suite. 

Veterans and their families need a trustworthy way to provide feedback for the digital services that the VA offers. 

### Usability Study Goals:

- Document and prioritize any outstanding usability issues that might come up when Veterans and their families fill out a feedback survey
- Help VSP and VFS teams understand Veteran priorities when it comes to potential new survey designs
- Determine whether Veterans have a clear and realistic understanding of how their feedback will be used once the form is submitted

### Research Questions:

- Are users able to locate the feedback form easily?
- Are veterans able to navigate through the form easily?
- Are veterans empowered to start and complete the form? Do veteran trust that the survey is provided by the VA?
- Do veterans understand the questions and answers that are asked of them?
- Do veterans understand how to answer each question?
- Do veterans understand that their survey responses will not be responded to by the VA?

### Hypothesis

Veterans will be able to navigate into and through the survey relatively easily, but may have difficulty with the following:

- Understanding content for the A11 questionnaire
- Completing the questionnaire if they are using a screen reader
- Understanding that their responses will not be responded to


## Method

We will conduct remote moderated usability testing and directed interviews via Zoom using the Perigean contract. These methods will help us:

- Gather quantitative data on usability of the survey through the usability testing and some of the directed interview questions
  - Discern whether or not the form is easy to locate & use
  - Discern whether or not the form is sufficient regarding the feedback users aim to submit
  - Discern expectations on how the forms are processed and handled
- Gather qualitative data on thoughts and impressions via the directed interviews
  - Understand veteran priorities & motivations for submitting feedback

We will be utilizing the staging site for our testing. Currently, two forms—the intercept survey and feedback survey—are currently accessibly on specific staging pages.
