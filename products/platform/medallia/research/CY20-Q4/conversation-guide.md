## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Ian and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about methods of giving feedback, like complaints or compliments, for the tools and services found on VA.gov.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

*If participant is using assistive technology, ask them:*
- If you use assisitve techonology, is it running? Is your screen reader running?

## Set Up - 5 minutes

In order to get the most out of this session, I would like to be able to see your screen. Can you let me know what kind of device you’re using, laptop/desktop or a mobile device?

**If desktop participant**

- Talk them through Zoom screen sharing and chat features

**If mobile participant**

*For iPhone:*

- When you are inside the zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. Audio, Video, Share content, Participants, and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share content." Any questions?
- Tap ‘Share content’ (Green button at bottom middle of the screen)
- Tap on Screen
- Tap Zoom
- Tap start broadcast. After a count of 3, the entire device screen will be shared into the meeting
- Tap the red bar at the top of your screen when you are ready to end the share
- Great, now I can see your phone screen! I'm going to begin now if that's ok with you. We will return to this in a few moments. For troubleshooting screen sharing in iOS, reference the Zoom documentation here https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005890803-iOS-Screen-Sharing

*For Android:*

- When you are inside the zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. For instance, Share and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share." Any questions?
- Tap "Share"
- Tap "Screen"
- May give a "sensitive info" alert
- May ask you to give Zoom permission to display over other apps, toggle yes. The hit the back arrow . Then it might just share your screen.
- Tap "Start now" (maybe) For Android troubleshooting, try here: https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen

**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

**If participant is using assistive technology, ask them:**
- As you are tabbing through to get to your screen share, before you reach that there should be an opption to "share computer audio." Can you enable that for me? That way we can hear your assistive tech read out.

**Recording Instructions**

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - *If yes:* Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

**Start recording.**

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?"

Great. Now we're really ready to begin!

**Task: You would like to submit feedback on this Find VA Locations page on the VA.gov website. What would be your process for submitting that feedback?**

As you’re performing this task, please talk us through your thoughts as you interact with the site.

### Things to watch for:

- Were they able to find the form and open it?

*If they find the form and open it:* Ok great! Can you leave this form open while I ask a few follow up questions? You don’t need to fill it out or submit it.

### Follow-up Questions

- On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form. 
  - Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form? 
- What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?

*Send the link to the* [*West Los Angeles VA Medical Center*](https://staging.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vha_691) *page in the chat.*

*On page load, make sure the intercept survey appears. If it does not, have the user refresh the page. If the form continues to not load, share your screen and pull up the form.*

**Task: How would you go about providing feedback on this page? Again, once you locate the form, you do not need to fill it out and submit it.**

As you’re performing this task, please talk us through your thoughts as you interact with the site.

You don't have to work through this whole form, just the first question and we can move on to the follow-up questions.

## Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes

That’s it for the tasks, but I have a few general questions in reference to both of these forms.

- Have there been any experiences you’ve had on VA.gov that would cause you to want to provide feedback?
- Who do you think is responsible for creating this feedback form?
- What do you think happens after you submit feedback?

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
