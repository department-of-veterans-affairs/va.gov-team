First Task: Feedback Survey

    *   **1 Very Difficult.  She informed that her “brain doesn’t think sideways.”  She thought that the blue was part of the decoration of the page.  The button blends into the page.**

Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes
--------------------------------

That’s it for the tasks, but I have a few general questions in reference to both of these forms.

*   Do you feel confident submitting these feedback forms?

    *   **Yes, she feels confident filling out the second form because it has the VA U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs logo.  She wanted an acknowledgement of who is presenting it and where it would be going.**
    *   **She noticed the created by Medallia stamp**

    *   **The Webmaster**
