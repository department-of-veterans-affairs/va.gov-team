Warm-up Questions - 7 minutes
-----------------------------

*   Are you aware of any options that va.gov offers for providing feedback on the website?

    *   If NO: Can you describe a situation in which you might want to submit feedback to VA.gov?

        *   **I think when going through the disability claims process, some of the things that popped up, I had no idea what they meant. In feedback, I would ask for terms and requirements to be clarified, as it would help other veterans. I’d have to call fellow veterans for assistance, otherwise. Clarification would make the process easier.**


First Task: Feedback Survey
---------------------------

Task: You would like to submit feedback on this Find VA Locations page on the VA.gov website. What would be your process for submitting that feedback?  
**I would assume there’d be some sort of feedback down here, but I’m not seeing anything that jumps out at me (scrolled to bottom). I don’t see it.**

### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the form and open it?

    *   **After some direction, the user found the blue box on the right side.**
    *   **User found it quickly after the box was mentioned.**

### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.

    *   **It’s not intuitive, rating 2.**
*   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?

    *   **I would see it if I stared at the screen long enough. Make it red to stand out more. Not intuitive to look to the side.**

*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?

    *   **It doesn’t really say … wouldn’t be helpful if I wasn’t successful in finding what I was looking for, just rates my experience of finding, as if it did work.**

*   Which questions do you think could be clarified?

    *   **It should ask for what I was trying to do, then ask whether I was successful.**

*   Would you, personally, fill out this form?

    *   **If I was successful, probably not. If my search didn’t work, I’d be more apt.**
*   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?

    *   **I’d probably use a laptop or desktop. VA.gov on a phone isn’t useful to me.**


Second Task: Intercept Survey
-----------------------------

Task: How would you go about providing feedback on this page? Again, once you locate the form, you do not need to fill it out and submit it.

### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the “Provide Feedback” button on the intercept survey?

    *   **I found it, right there!**
    *   **(Found it quickly). I’d just click the blue button.**

### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.

    *   **For finding it, I’d say 5. It’s right there in your face.**
*   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?

    *   **Easy to find, short enough for most people to be able to fill out quickly.**

*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?

    *   **The trust questions seem strange in this context. I understand why VA is doing that, I work in behavioral health… but it seems a little awkward to have trust less/more questions in this form. Maybe have more questions about my search before leading into trust questions. Then it would make more sense.**

*   Take a moment to review all the questions on the survey. Are there any questions you don’t understand or need clarification on?

    *   **It’s pretty clear, and the feedback would be pertinent.**

*   Would you, personally, fill out this survey?

    *   **Yes, if it pops up easily like this. I’d feel confident using it, I am comfortable.**
*   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?

    *   **Desktop, laptop.**


Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes
--------------------------------

That’s it for the tasks, but I have a few general questions in reference to both of these forms.

*   Do you feel confident submitting these feedback forms?

    *   **Yes**

*   Have there been any experiences you’ve had on VA.gov that would cause you to want to provide feedback?

    *   **The claims process for disability--to be able to say this statement is unclear, etc. To leave feedback on something like that.**

*   Who do you think is responsible for creating this feedback form?

    *   **I’m assuming some quality assurance section of VA.**

*   What do you think happens after you submit feedback?

    *   **Considering they’re scaled, I assume they go into a system where VA can pull reports and analyze results, seeing specific areas that users are having trouble with.**

*   Final comments:

    *   **Overall, my experience is that I’ve had no problems with VA.gov. Claims process, working with people at VA, it has been awesome! Good job, VA! VA in Fairbanks, AK, has been tops!**
    *   **I have a few VA friends that I might refer to take your survey. Some in AK, others elsewhere.**
