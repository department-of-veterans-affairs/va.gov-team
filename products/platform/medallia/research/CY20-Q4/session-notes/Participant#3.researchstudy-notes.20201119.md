Warm-up Questions - 7 minutes (Tina Oltvedt)
--------------------------------------------

*   Are you aware of any options that va.gov offers for providing feedback on the website?

    *   **She informed that she thought she'd seen it.  She recalls a “chat” button, but that’s all.  She hasn’t used it to leave feedback.  She informed that she’s used to government systems and her expectations are that they will remain the same and she’s comfortable with them (government systems).**

*   If NO: Can you describe a situation in which you might want to submit feedback to VA.gov?

    *   **If the Website redirects her, or it doesn’t work at all (technical issues).  She prefers to offer feedback because she wants to be able to say that she contributed to change.**


First Task: Feedback Survey
---------------------------

Task: You would like to submit feedback on this Find VA Locations page on the VA.gov website. What would be your process for submitting that feedback?

### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the form and open it?

    *   **During our session, the Zoom video box was covering the Feedback button.**

### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.

    *   **Tina informed that it was a 5 (very easy)**
*   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?

    *   **She informed that she’s trying to do multiple things when she accesses VA.gov, so the form should allow feedback based on multiple tasks versus a single task.**

*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?

    *   **None, but she’s interested to know who sees this form.**

*   Which questions do you think could be clarified?

    *   **None of the questions**

*   Would you, personally, fill out this form?

    *   **If it was a real problem, yes... otherwise no.  Example: If she tried more than once, then she would complete the form.  The system failed multiple times.**
*   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?

    *   **Phone or computer is an option that she would use.**


Second Task: Intercept Survey
-----------------------------

Task: How would you go about providing feedback on this page? Again, once you locate the form, you do not need to fill it out and submit it.

### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the “Provide Feedback” button on the intercept survey?

    *   **She said that she would click the Provide Feedback button.**
    *   **Due to the Zoom call video window, she was not able to see the “Feedback” button, but after moving it she was able to see the button.**

### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.

    *   **5 (very easy) She informed the the Provide Feedback “smacks you in the face”**
*   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?

    *   **She didn’t find anything challenging about the form.**

*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?

    *   **She has no questions. She informed that she likes it.**

*   Take a moment to review all the questions on the survey. Are there any questions you don’t understand or need clarification on?

    *   **She informed that it’s transparent.  She understands the reason for the form's length.**
    *   **She did note that “Need was not addressed” was not on the form and that would be an option that she would want to see.**

*   Would you, personally, fill out this survey?

    *   **Yes**
*   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?

    *   **Both, desktop and phone**


Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes
--------------------------------

That’s it for the tasks, but I have a few general questions in reference to both of these forms.

*   Do you feel confident submitting these feedback forms?

    *   **What do you mean by confident? (Ian expounded) Yes, she is confident in completing the form, but not confident that change would occur based on her feedback.**

*   Have there been any experiences you’ve had on VA.gov that would cause you to want to provide feedback?

    *   **No**

*   Who do you think is responsible for creating this feedback form?

    *   **She doesn’t know**
    *   **She informed that she would assume that its not the VA because VA typically contracts out.  She believes that it would actually be worked on for that reason.**

*   What do you think happens after you submit feedback?

    *   **She believes that the completed form would end up in “Junk” and that the only reason it would be read is if someone just so happened to open it to read it.**
    *   **No, she would not be expecting a response.**
