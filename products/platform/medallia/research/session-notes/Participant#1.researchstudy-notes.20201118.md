## Set Up

*Participant feedback in bold*

Can you let me know what kind of device you’re using, laptop/desktop or a mobile device?
**User accesses VA.gov via Macintosh laptop computer.**

* * *

Warm-up Questions - 7 minutes
-----------------------------

*   Are you aware of any options that va.gov offers for providing feedback on the website?

    *   If NO: Can you describe a situation in which you might want to submit feedback to VA.gov?

    *   **I have never used VA.gov to provide feedback before. I usually go to MyHealtheVet, make a comment through MyDoc, or contact a clinic.  
        For specific information about the issue of survivor’s benefits, I’ll go to VA.gov.** 


First Task: Feedback Survey
---------------------------

Task: You would like to submit feedback on this Find VA Locations page on the VA.gov website. What would be your process for submitting that feedback?

**I don’t see where to input feedback. I only see location, facility type, service type, and search. And enter location, on the map. Up above, I see a search for feedback and contact us.**

### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the form and open it?

    *   **There’s About VA, right there up top. Seems obvious that I would go there to give feedback. And I’d use Contact Us. I didn’t see the blue feedback button on the side until you pointed it out.**
*   Try and note how quickly they found the button (quickly, not so quickly, looked in the wrong spot, clicked on the wrong button, etc)
    *   **Not so quickly; User required some direction.**

### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.

    *   **To find these places, I’d rate the difficulty 3.5 on a scale of 1-5 (5 being the easiest).**
*   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?

    *   **User found it to be relatively easy, yet still gave a 3.5, as the button on the right side for feedback wasn’t obvious**

*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?

    *   **Is an indefinite amount of characters allowed? Will it cut me off? Deleting and condensing or otherwise starting over (isn’t preferred).**
    *   **Was I able to do my task today? Well, maybe you did part of it; so you’d have to decide if it was a yes or a no. That’s sort of a subjective answer (the feedback form asks for).** 

*   Which questions do you think could be clarified?

    *   **The ability to do your task--I’d like to see a range (1-10) to show how much of my task I completed. I was looking for information on diabetes, and after looking at 10 things, I was able to drill down on what I was looking for.**

*   Would you, personally, fill out this form?

    *   **Sure!**
*   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?

    *   **I would not use phone, but I would use laptop in a private spot.**


Second Task: Intercept Survey
-----------------------------

Task: How would you go about providing feedback on this page? If I was looking for a VA location, and I found it, I’d probably say in “Provide Feedback” that I was able to find it easily. 

### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the “Provide Feedback” button on the intercept survey?

*   Try and note how quickly the found the button (quickly, not so quickly, looked in wrong spot, clicked on wrong button, etc)

### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.

    *   **Finding the Provide Feedback button - 4    not hard, didn’t see immediately.**
*   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?

    *   **On the previous page, feedback was at the edge of the page, kind of small and vertical, thus harder to read. I guess the designer had to fit it in somehow. Here, it is easier.**

*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?

    *   **Feedback form is pretty articulate and asks a lot of questions. Answers would be subjective.**

*   Take a moment to review all the questions on the survey. Are there any questions you don’t understand or need clarification on?

    *   **I was “treated fairly,” but how is that relevant as being relevant when I’m looking for something on the website; I’m not interacting with a person.**
    *   **What was being asked of me? I don’t think I have any problem determining and understanding that.**
    *   **Some of the checkbox options are “splitting hairs,” but I guess it’s useful to articulate the level of satisfaction.**
    *   **I understand what the questions are asking, on a subjective level.**

*   Would you, personally, fill out this survey?

    *   **Yes, if I had the time. Sometimes I don’t. But I’d try, because they probably need this information.**
*   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?

    *   **Mac laptop**


Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes
--------------------------------

That’s it for the tasks, but I have a few general questions in reference to both of these forms.

*   Do you feel confident submitting these feedback forms?

    *   **Yes.**

*   Have there been any experiences you’ve had on VA.gov that would cause you to want to provide feedback?

    *   **Yes, once or twice, there were some medical conditions I tried to drill down on. I found a general description of the condition, cause, but that’s it. I needed more, so I went to my private medical provider and asked the same questions.**
    *   **I used to go to VA hearing decisions on precedent-setting cases (from 1997-3/2018), providing my feedback. Then I would go to VA.gov to see how those conditions are discussed/covered. I would also look for private sector specialists, and I received good care from them, leading to my trusting VA less.**

*   Who do you think is responsible for creating this feedback form?

    *   **Seems like an IT job and data analysts building/providing information on what Vets need; plus some customer service information on keeping customers satisfied. They should keep that in mind when deciding the structure/content of VA.gov; could a person with cognitive deficit use it?**

*   What do you think happens after you submit feedback?

    *   **I’m thinking it goes to a file, then that file is perused somehow, analyzed for course of action.**

## Final Thoughts:  

**VA.gov and the forms are a very helpful resource, to get your answer or to jump off to into other sources based on VA.gov guidance - medical journals, et al.**

**Note: User knows Vets around the country who would be willing to participate in this survey; sending user info to forward to other potential respondents.**
