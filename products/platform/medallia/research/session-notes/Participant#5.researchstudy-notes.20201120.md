Warm-up Questions - 7 minutes
-----------------------------

*   Are you aware of any options that va.gov offers for providing feedback on the website?

    *   If NO: Can you describe a situation in which you might want to submit feedback to VA.gov?

        *   **No, Herbert was not aware.  He inquired on Benefits as well. Lack of employee (veteran) assistance.  He’s experienced a never-ending circle.  He would like to leave positive feedback as well.**


First Task: Feedback Survey
---------------------------

Task: You would like to submit feedback on this Find VA Locations page on the VA.gov website. What would be your process for submitting that feedback?

### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the form and open it?

    *   **He could not find the “Feedback” button.**

### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.

    *   **1 Very Difficult.  He thought the color should be changed and that it should not be to the side of the page.**
*   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?

*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?

    *   **None**

*   Which questions do you think could be clarified?

    *   **The questions are straightforward**

*   Would you, personally, fill out this form?

    *   **Yes**
*   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?

    *   **A combination of phone and laptop**


Second Task: Intercept Survey
-----------------------------

Task: How would you go about providing feedback on this page? Again, once you locate the form, you do not need to fill it out and submit it.

### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the “Provide Feedback” button on the intercept survey?

    *   **Yes, it was easy to find, but would he be able to find this Provide feedback button later.**
    *   **It was easy to find**

### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.

    *   **5 - Very Easy**
*   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?

    *   **He immediately commented that the form was too much (too long).**

*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?

    *   **Take notes here**

*   Take a moment to review all the questions on the survey. Are there any questions you don’t understand or need clarification on?

    *   **He felt that he had to answer general questions, but he could not add commentary that fit his feedback needs.**

*   Would you, personally, fill out this survey?

    *   **He would not because he felt it had redundant questions.  He preferred a simple question and answer box that he could add commentary.**
*   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?


Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes
--------------------------------

That’s it for the tasks, but I have a few general questions in reference to both of these forms.

*   Do you feel confident submitting these feedback forms?

    *   **Yes, but not confident that it would be read.**

*   Have there been any experiences you’ve had on VA.gov that would cause you to want to provide feedback?

    *   **Yes, he said there was a post surgery feedback that he wished to give, but he could not find.**

*   Who do you think is responsible for creating this feedback form?

    *   **He said a “research office”**
    *   **He thought the office would be a VA or Benefits office.**

*   What do you think happens after you submit feedback?

    *   **He figured that the answers would go through an algorithm that would determine whether or not it would be read.**

Other Veteran Comments: 
**He noted that he would like a single sign-on as it is difficult to remember the number of passwords for each site.**

**He does know other veterans (Facebook Group) that would be willing to help with research later.**
