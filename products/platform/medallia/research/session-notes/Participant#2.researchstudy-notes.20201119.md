Warm-up Questions - 7 minutes
-----------------------------

*   Are you aware of any options that va.gov offers for providing feedback on the website?

    *   If YES:
        *   **NOTE: the user said yes, but his answer indicated that he perhaps did know of options for providing feedback on VA.gov**

    *   Can you describe which options you are aware of?
        *   **Vaguely. I’ve glanced at it a couple of times. Saw something about getting paid for travel expenses. I’m going to the VA hospital tomorrow. And there was a notice saying there was something you could if you went to VA.gov. Couldn’t figure out how to do it. I’ll do it at the hospital if that doesn’t work**

    *   If NO:

        *   Can you describe a situation in which you might want to submit feedback to VA.gov?

            *   **Yes sure. Thank them for getting my medication out quickly. I lost some medication and I had to make a phone call and they had to go through a urologist or rheumatologist and they quickly got the medication out to me and wanted to thank them.**
            *   **The other thing - i had a terrible pain in my groin area, I have an enlarged prostate and had a lot of pain, and it was excruciating. I had a good bowel movement and it got better. I called the VA and they were going to see if they could schedule me for a quick visit tomorrow. That’s another thing I would want to call them again and thank them for their service.**


First Task: Feedback Survey
---------------------------

Task: You would like to submit feedback on this Find VA Locations page on the VA.gov website. What would be your process for submitting that feedback?

### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the form and open it?

    *   **NOTE: Initially user was describing how to use the facility locator**
    *   **I would plug in the city, facility type I’d have to figure out what that means. Service type I’d have to figure out that means. I’d type in that information. I see a map here (he is not answering the question).**

*   Q: If you wanted to provide feedback on this page?

    *   **The user looked around the page and then scrolled down to the bottom where the footer. This didn’t take too long for him to do and said “Down at the bottom, there is a contact us and it has a list of different things, homeless veterans, PTSD (he’s scrolling through the options in the footer). There is also something called Ask a Question. And there is an 1800 number.**
    *   **The user did not ever find the feedback tab on the side, likely because the zoom tiles were blocking it. This was not verified but that is our assumption because even with guidance, he could not find it.**

### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.
*   **1**
*   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?
*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?
*   **How do I find it? I’m looking at my computer screen, and I couldn’t find it , even with your help.**
*   Q: Do you have any questions about the information?
*   **No not at all. The questions are fine.**
*   Would you, personally, fill out this form?
*   **Oh yes**
*   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?
*   **A laptop. I have an iphone and a laptop but the desktop is not working.**
*   Q: Do you ever use your phone visit va.gov?
    *   **I haven’t. But I could. I use my iphone fo ra lot of things. Banking, checking on the stock market.**
    *   **But i would use the laptop to fill out the form.**

Second Task: Intercept Survey
-----------------------------

Task: How would you go about providing feedback on this page? Again, once you locate the form, you do not need to fill it out and submit it.

### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the “Provide Feedback” button on the intercept survey?

*   **Immediately found and hit the provide feedback button**

### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.

*   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?

    *   **Uhhh I’d say 4.**
    *   **I give it a four because your instructions guiding me helped. But once I was able to find it, it was easy.**

*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?

    *   **This is fairly easy, please rate your experience today, I would just go and fill this out. I’d answer them each one going down.**

*   Take a moment to review all the questions on the survey. Are there any questions you don’t understand or need clarification on?

    *   **How did this interaction change your trust in veterans affairs - I don’t know about the need for that. I guess you guys someone at the va would want to know more about it. I would answer it, but as a veteran I couldn’t think of a need that it tries to provide. Any other questions? No, how much do you trust them? But the rest are easy to follow.**

*   Would you, personally, fill out this survey?

    *   **Oh yes definitely**
*   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?

    *   **Everything would be laptop**


Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes
--------------------------------

That’s it for the tasks, but I have a few general questions in reference to both of these forms.

*   Do you feel confident submitting these feedback forms?

    *   **Oh yeah, you know it’s funny my son asked me to not share information or password over the internet. I told him I was just getting my ID.me that was requested to sign in. I will not provide my social security number except for the four digits and other things but I’m comfortable with this.**

*   Have there been any experiences you’ve had on VA.gov that would cause you to want to provide feedback?

    *   **No, like I said, I reviewed it for filing travel expenses, but I didn’t follow through.**

*   Who do you think is responsible for creating this feedback form?

    *   **An organization - someone retained by the government, the VA itself, some sort of guy who is more savvy into technology than I have ever been. A technical person with the government.**

*   What do you think happens after you submit feedback?

    *   **It goes into a computer somewhere and some tech guy would review it and make notations to see what modifications should be made at their end.**

*   Closing thoughts

    *   **No, it’s been pretty good.**

*   Do you know of any other veterans or caregivers who would be interested in participating in a future session.

    *   **I don’t have contact with them anymore**
    *   **It was a pleasure dealing with you.**
