*Participant feedback in bold*

Can you let me know what kind of device you’re using, laptop/desktop or a mobile device?

I’m using a PC/Windows laptop.

Warm-up Questions - 7 minutes
-----------------------------

*   Are you aware of any options that va.gov offers for providing feedback on the website?

    *   If NO: Can you describe a situation in which you might want to submit feedback to VA.gov?

        *   **So many! The inability to get a hold of people, especially during shutdown. I’ve had many occasions where I was desperately trying to find people, I made phone calls, and I got nothing. I’d also talk about being able to doctor’s notices. And the whole VA experience of online vs. in-person.**


First Task: Feedback Survey
---------------------------

Task: You would like to submit feedback on this Find VA Locations page on the VA.gov website. What would be your process for submitting that feedback? I would go down to Contact Us or Call Us. Or use the Contact Us menu at the top.

### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the form and open it?

    *   **(After guidance) Oh! There’s a button that says feedback. Yeah, I see it now. That’s not intuitive. It’s over to the side, it doesn’t pop out.**

### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.

    *   **I’d give it a 2.**
*   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?

    *   **All the text is in the middle, where your eyes go. You’re not looking off to the side for a button.**

*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?

    *   **It seems straightforward. But I’d like more specific questions in the form.**

*   Which questions do you think could be clarified?

    *   **If this is the form, it is clear. Maybe an option for requesting contact.**

*   Would you, personally, fill out this form?

    *   **It’s 50/50, depending on what was going on. If it was a significant event, positive or negative, I would. But I wouldn’t bother if it was just a search for basic info.**
*   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?

    *   **Laptop.**


Second Task: Intercept Survey
-----------------------------

Task: How would you go about providing feedback on this page? Again, once you locate the form, you do not need to fill it out and submit it.

### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the “Provide Feedback” button on the intercept survey?

    *   **For this one, it smacks you in the face in the pop-up thing. The button is super-evident, the provide feedback button.**

### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.

    *   **That’s a 5.**
*   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?

    *   **It pops up and smacks me in the face, takes over the screen.**

*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?

    *   **The “why did you select” buttons are all positive. Wouldn’t work if I had a negative experience. Not neutral. I like the radio buttons.**

*   Take a moment to review all the questions on the survey. Are there any questions you don’t understand or need clarification on?

    *   **The “rate how understandable” part is awkwardly written.**

*   Would you, personally, fill out this survey?

    *   **Yes.**
*   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?

    *   **Typically my laptop or my phone (not frequently on the latter for VA.gov). Mostly on laptop.**


Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes
--------------------------------

That’s it for the tasks, but I have a few general questions in reference to both of these forms.

*   Do you feel confident submitting these feedback forms?

    *   **In my ability, yes. Makes sense, clear, easy, very well put-together.**

*   Have there been any experiences you’ve had on VA.gov that would cause you to want to provide feedback?

    *   **I’ve had issues finding contact info. Couldn’t find, or didn’t know where to look. Also, I’ve wondered at times whether I should use VA.gov, MyHealtheVet, something else for my GI Bill? It’s confusing.**

*   Who do you think is responsible for creating this feedback form?

    *   **Somebody in a computer room at the VA.**

*   What do you think happens after you submit feedback?

    *   **It goes into a black hole and nobody does anything with it… that’s the cynical side of me talking.**
    *   **When companies get feedback like this, it’s collected and conglomerated. Even with reports, however, not much is done. Would hope this would impact VA.gov website.**
    *   **I much prefer the second form. It’s easy to say no if you don’t need it, and if  you do, it’s right there. The one on the side is easy to ignore.**
    *   **It was funny, looking for that box (for the first form). It was there, I just didn’t see it. How did I miss that one box?**

**I appreciate what you guys are doing to make things better, more customer-focused; makes me feel better that it’s outsourced (Medallia).**
