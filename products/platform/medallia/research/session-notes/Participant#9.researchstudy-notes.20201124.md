Set Up (Ian, Ervin (Notetaker))
------------------------------------------------------------
*Participant feedback in bold*

Can you let me know what kind of device you’re using, laptop/desktop or a mobile device?

- **Laptop**

Warm-up Questions - 7 minutes
-----------------------------

*   Are you aware of any options that va.gov offers for providing feedback on the website?

    *   If YES:

    *   Can you describe which options you are aware of?

        *   **You can go to IRIS.  It does not say that you can provide feedback though. She’s used IRIS to check the status of her claim.  It’s faster than the benefits area (Webpage).**

*   Have you ever used any of these options?

    *   **Yes**

    *   Why / why not?

        *   **She moved and didn’t receive pay.**

First Task: Feedback Survey
---------------------------

Task: You would like to submit feedback on this Find VA Locations page on the VA.gov website. What would be your process for submitting that feedback?

**She informed that she would go to the bottom of the page under Contact Us.**

### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the form and open it?

*   **She was able to find the Feedback button.**
*   Try and note how quickly the found the button (quickly, not so quickly, looked in wrong spot, clicked on wrong button, etc)

### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.

    *   **“1, but I’ll say 2”  She didn’t like the color of the button.  She informed that she would rather see the button on the bottom right corner.**
*   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?

*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?

    *   **She said that she would like to have the question “Is there anything that we could do to make this better?”**

*   Which questions do you think could be clarified?

    *   **She informed that she would like the option to leave feedback on multiple tasks.**

*   Would you, personally, fill out this form?

    *   **Yes**
*   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?

    *   **Laptop preferred.  She has used the Website with Jaws (screenreader).  She informed that it’s a lot better than it used to be.**


Second Task: Intercept Survey
-----------------------------

Task: How would you go about providing feedback on this page? Again, once you locate the form, you do not need to fill it out and submit it.

### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the “Provide Feedback” button on the intercept survey?

*   **She would click the “Provide feedback” button.**
*   **Very quickly**

### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.

    *   **5, the button was easy because it popped up.**
*   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?

    *   **She prefers a scroll option on the actual form versus to the right hand side of the screen, which would help her realize that there were more questions to complete.**

*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?

*   Take a moment to review all the questions on the survey. Are there any questions you don’t understand or need clarification on?

    *   **She wanted an “other” option for one of the questions...a box that she could type information (additional comments).  She does like the “trust” questions, but she feels that an older generation would not have a high level of trust.**

*   Would you, personally, fill out this survey?

    *   **Yes, she likes that the form is much better than it was in 2014.**
*   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?

    *   **Desktop**


Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes
--------------------------------

That’s it for the tasks, but I have a few general questions in reference to both of these forms.

*   Do you feel confident submitting these feedback forms?

    *   **Yes, but would really like to see the scroll within the form.**

*   Have there been any experiences you’ve had on VA.gov that would cause you to want to provide feedback?

    *   **Checking the status of her claim/appeal, she found that her pay had been increased but she had not been informed by the Website.  Basically, the Website is not updated based on the current status.  She also wanted clarification on a “Deferred” designation.**

*   Who do you think is responsible for creating this feedback form?

    *   **The IT department at VA is responsible for this form.**

*   What do you think happens after you submit feedback?

    *   **She believes that the form is prioritized based on the answers to the questions.**

Additional comments: 

*   **She was not able to update her phone number via the “Access and manage your VA benefits and health care Webpage.”**
*   **She’s looking for an option for people who are stressed...something other than the Veterans Crisis Line.  An option that is a middle ground...something for venting or just being heard.**
