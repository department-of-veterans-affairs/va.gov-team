Warm-up Questions - 7 minutes
-----------------------------

*   Are you aware of any options that va.gov offers for providing feedback on the website?

    *   If YES:
        *   **He figured Yes, but he generally has no complaints...no reason to use them.**
    *   If NO: Can you describe a situation in which you might want to submit feedback to VA.gov?

        *   **He wanted to request a monitoring device, but it took him a little while to send a message.  Basically, he was not able to find certain information.**


First Task: Feedback Survey
---------------------------

Task: You would like to submit feedback on this Find VA Locations page on the VA.gov website. What would be your process for submitting that feedback?

### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the form and open it?

    *   **He informed that he would look at the top of the screen under “? Contact Us”.**
    *   **He informed that he would look below (bottom of Webpage) for the Feedback button.**

### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.

    *   **2, maybe even 1.** 
*   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?

    *   **He doesn’t like the fact that he would have to look sideways to read the word Feedback.  He mentioned that since it’s off to the right that it was easy to overlook.**

*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?

    *   **No questions.  He believes that he could submit the form for feedback without issue.**

*   Which questions do you think could be clarified?

    *   **He said the form assumes that he was completing a task, as in maybe he wanted to submit feedback about a doctor.**

*   Would you, personally, fill out this form?

    *   **Yes, it would be useful because he could type feedback, versus completing a questionnaire.**
*   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?

    *   **Desktop.  He doesn’t generally use his phone for VA.gov.**


Second Task: Intercept Survey
-----------------------------

Task: How would you go about providing feedback on this page? Again, once you locate the form, you do not need to fill it out and submit it.

### Things to watch for:

*   Were they able to find the “Provide Feedback” button on the intercept survey?

    *   **Yes**
    *   **He found the button very quickly.**

### Follow-up Questions

*   On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy, please describe your experience in trying to find the feedback form.

    *   **5, but nothings easy so 4**
*   Follow-up, based on the number they give you (1, 2, 3 for challenging, 4 or 5 easy): What did you find challenging about this form? OR What did you find easy to use about this form?

    *   **He likes the limited answers for the first question, but the second question has too many answers.  It would take too long to answer questions that don’t pertain to the feedback that he would like to leave.**

*   What questions do you have about how to fill out the form?

*   Take a moment to review all the questions on the survey. Are there any questions you don’t understand or need clarification on?

    *   **No, he believes the last two questions are too general.**

*   Would you, personally, fill out this survey?

    *   **Yes, because he’s retired and has plenty of time.**
*   If yes: Would you fill it out on your desktop or phone?

    *   **Desktop**


Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes
--------------------------------

That’s it for the tasks, but I have a few general questions in reference to both of these forms.

*   Do you feel confident submitting these feedback forms?

    *   **Yes**

*   Have there been any experiences you’ve had on VA.gov that would cause you to want to provide feedback?

    *   **No**

*   Who do you think is responsible for creating this feedback form?

    *   **VA hired a contractor**
    *   **He believes that the VA is directly responsible and involved**

*   What do you think happens after you submit feedback?

    *   **He doesn’t know**
    *   **He believes that a contractor could be consolidating the information and submitted to the VA via a report.**

Any other feedback?
**He believes that the forms are a good step and that the VA does care about the Veterans feedback.  It increases his trust in the VA and that the VA is trying to do the right thing for the Veterans that it serves.  He appreciates that the VA is doing this and it leads to useful changes.**
