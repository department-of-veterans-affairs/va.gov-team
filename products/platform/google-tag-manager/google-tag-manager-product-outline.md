# Google Tag Manager Product Outline

# Product Title

## Overview
Google Tag Manager is a tool that tracks user interactions and shares those metrics with Google Analytics and BigQuery. We use Google Tag Manager as the main user tracking tool on VA digital products.

* Google Tag Manager feeds Google Analytics data. This product outline can serve both Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics.

## Problem Statement
VFS teams need a way to track interactions on their VFSs so that they can understand how veterans and their families are using their products and design better products for their users.

## Personas
VSP Analytics & Insights have access to Google Tag Manager and implement the tags.
VFS teams (product managers/owners and front end developers) request tags and implement code on the front end to connect to Google Tag Manager.

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
 - % of live VFSs with Google Tag Manager implemented
 - Number of VFSs with Google Tag Manager implemented correctly
 - Time to complete Google Tag Manager customer support

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics, if possible._

## Assumptions
- Effort levels are higher to monitor security and train FE developers than to implement GTM within VSP
- We will continue to work with Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager as the main tools for collecting VSP 

## Solution Approach

- Google Tag Manager is an out of box tool that is currently being used by VSP Analytics & Insights

**Q1-Q2 2021**
- Platform Analytics standardized analytics tagging for Design System components. More information about the project process can be found [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsp/teams/insights-analytics/tracking-design-system-components.md), and more information about the technical implementation can be located [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/analytics/google-analytics/build-process-measuring-pageviews-and-events.md#component-library).
- 4/28/21 - After the initial [standardization initiative](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsp-5cedc9cce6e3335dc5a49fc4/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/3085) is completed, the Platform Analytics team plans to add analytics standardization for future Design System components as an ongoing service. This is to keep up with new Design System components, create more "out-of-the-box" analytics tagging solutions, and decrease overall customer support time for both Platform Analytics & VFS teams.
