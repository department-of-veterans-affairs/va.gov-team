# Google Tag Manager Product Outline

# Product Title

## Overview
Google Tag Manager is a tool that tracks user interactions and shares those metrics with Google Analytics and BigQuery. We use Google Tag Manager as the main user tracking tool on VA digital products.

* Google Tag Manager feeds Google Analytics data. This product outline can serve both Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics.

## Problem Statement
VFS teams need a way to track interactions on their VFSs so that they can understand how veterans and their families are using their products and design better products for their users.

## Personas
VSP Analytics & Insights have access to Google Tag Manager and implement the tags.
VFS teams (product managers/owners and front end developers) request tags and implement code on the front end to connect to Google Tag Manager.

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
 - % of live VFSs with Google Tag Manager implemented
 - Number of VFSs with Google Tag Manager implemented correctly
 - Time to complete Google Tag Manager customer support

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics, if possible._

## Assumptions
- Effort levels are higher to monitor security and train FE developers than to implement GTM within VSP
- We will continue to work with Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager as the main tools for collecting VSP 

## Solution Approach

- N/A
- Google Tag Manager is an out of box tool that is currently being used by VSP Analytics & Insights

_For non-trivial technical solutions, an [engineering design doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/engineering/design-docs) should be written to deeply explain **How** this product will be built._
