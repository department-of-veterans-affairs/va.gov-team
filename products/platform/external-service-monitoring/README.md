# External Service Performance Monitoring 

This product is a collection of resources to help understand performance of external services from the VSP perspective.

### Documentation

- [`./service-documents/*.md`](./service-documents/) contains a "one-pager" document per-service outlining performance baselines, links to dashboards, and resources for each external service partner
- ['How to Write Your SLOs'](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/policies-work-norms/how-to-write-your-slos.md) contains instructions and reference for VFS teams to use when defining product SLOs

### Grafana dashboards

- üß¶ [External Service Status](http://grafana.vfs.va.gov/d/000000025/external-service-status?orgId=1) - high-level overview and network diagram used to determine if a given service is up
- üß¶ [External Service SLI](http://grafana.vfs.va.gov/d/pEgVdRlZk/external-service-availability-indicators?orgId=1) - service-level specific availability and performance metrics up to past 14 days
- üß¶ [Backend Service Report](http://grafana.vfs.va.gov/d/000000050/backend-service-report?orgId=1) - another view of external service request volume and latency
