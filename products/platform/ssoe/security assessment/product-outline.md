# SSOe Security Assessment Product Outline

## Overview
This product will actually result in a security assessment and remediation report.  The report will provide us with defined stakeholders, a documented architecture, a reference guide for all security functions, a prioritized list of findings based on risk level, remediation recommendations and requirements, estimates of effort, and a plan of action & milestones (POAM).

## Problem Statement
Since SSOe is transitioning to the Identity team, it is in VSPâ€™s best interest to perform a thorough security assessment that will examine the system and find potential weaknesses that we may not have know existed.


## Personas
* VSP Engineers
* VA Engineers


## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

KPI's TBD

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics, if possible._

---

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

_Describe, in a few sentences and/or bullet points, what you plan to build, and how it will solve the problem. Some questions to think about:_

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

_For non-trivial technical solutions, an [engineering design doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/engineering/design-docs) should be written to deeply explain **How** this product will be built._
