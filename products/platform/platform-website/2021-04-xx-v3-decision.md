## Context

In 2021 Q1, the Content team populated the Platform Website with persona-based landing pages.  In 2021 Q3, we aim to have Platform teams begin populating the Platform Website.  However, we cannot have simultaneously maintain Platform Website and Home Page MVP, as we would then have two sources of truth re: how to build on the VA.gov Platform.  Here are the options we see in deprecating the Home Page MVP.

## Paths forward

All options would be paired with deprecating the Home Page MVP, described in this ["How do we deprecate the Home Page in tandem with building out "V3?"" decision](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/platform-website/2021-04-xx-deprecate-homepage-decision.md).

### Option 1 (recommended by the Content Team): Move V2's "Designer landing page" and distribute all V1 content amongst V3 content sources

Outcome: The V3 portal page will reflect multiple content sources, all which contain content.

We hypothesize that providing multiple content sources will allow team members across a single VFS team to have a comprehensive Platform Website reading experience.

Steps:
1. Move the [V2 designer landing page](https://va-platform-docs.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/Designer-guide.970654156.html) to [V3's](https://va-platform-docs.scrollhelp.site/index.html) "Research and Design" content source.
2. Break up the [V1 Backend development documentaton](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/) into the appropriate [V3](https://va-platform-docs.scrollhelp.site/index.html) content sources. 
3. Add redirect verbiage to the Home Page MVP.

considerations:
- we might need a designer to develop icons for the content sources in the portal

### Option 2: Move V2's "Designer lading page" into a single V3 "Research and Design" content source

Outcome: The V3 portal page will reflect a single content sources.

Steps:
1. Move the [V2 designer landing page](https://va-platform-docs.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/Designer-guide.970654156.html) to [V3's](https://va-platform-docs.scrollhelp.site/index.html) "Research and Design" content source.
2. Break up the [V1 Backend development documentaton](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/) into the appropriate [V3](https://va-platform-docs.scrollhelp.site/index.html) content sources. 
3. Make sure we have accounted for all links from the Home Page MVP, in V3.  
4. Add redirect verbiage to the Home Page MVP.


### Option 3: asdf

To come.
