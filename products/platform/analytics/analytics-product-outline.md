# Product Outline

---

## Overview

The Platform Analytics team seeks to provide analytics as a data platform and educational resources and support for VFS teams to build towards data-informed outcomes.

## Problem Statement

VFS teams need analytics on top of their user research to better determine success so that they can understand what's truly meaningful to prioritize and build for Veterans. 

How might we empower VFS teams to make more data-informed decisions for better Veteran outcomes?

## Desired User Outcomes

When we refer to VFS teams, we are referring to the product decision makers on these teams. 

The primary users are people who are making the product decisions on the VFS teams:

- Product Managers
- DEPO Product Leads/Owners

The secondary users are:

- DEPO leadership
- Developers
- Designers

Our desired outcomes are as follows:

- VFS teams can **set** metrics:
  - North Star metrics and KPIs - so that they understand what success means for their products and how to measure that success; so that they can product data-informed definitions of product success and goals
  - Leading indicators - so that they can move the needle on their success metrics so that they can understand what to look out for it outcomes are not being met
- VFS teams can **track** their data: 
  - so that they can get frictionless access to accurate, trustworthy, and up-to date data relevant to their products
- VFS teams can **analyze** their data:
  - so that they can get insights into how the data affects their products' value and performance
- VFS teams can **assess** and **leverage** their data:
  - so that they can implement insights into solution narratives, including but not limited to:
    - sprint objectives
    - roadmaps/PI planning
    - product outlines (solution narratives, KPIs, & OKRs) 
  - so that they drive towards data-informed outcomes: their data-informed actions drive post-production changes (or no changes and they have to pivot their strategy) in their KPIs or North Star metric
- VFS teams can **report** data:
  - so that they can support their product design & engineering recommendations or pivots to stakeholders
  - so that they can share data-informed outcomes and use cases with the rest of the VA to encourage data-informed decision making and data sharing

## Undesired User Outcomes

- VFS teams are [data-*driven*, not data-informed](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/analytics/Analytics%20Playbook/analytics-playbook.md#what-is-data-informed-decision-making--why-use-it-for-vagov-services): 
  - they only use quantitative data to inform decision making and don't also look at user research
  - they use vanity metrics to drive output instead of outcomes; they are driving the numbers without asking or understanding why

## Desired Business Outcomes

- VA.gov applications are outcomes-driven: data is being used to inform decision making for better Veteran outcomes
- VA.gov-level KPIs and OKRs are tracked, assessed, and reported

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- VA.gov applications are data-*driven* instead of data-*informed*
  - applications' numbers are being moved without the teams or VA understanding why those metrics were moved

## Measuring Success

### North Star Metric

Recurring engaged users: Number of VA.gov teams reporting on their Product KPIs (data-informed outcomes) every month

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

*Limit 5-6 KPIs per product*

| Category | Findability                 | Ease of use                  | Service completion                                   | Trust/Satisfaction                       | Health                     |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| KPI      | % of VFSs with GTM tracked  | Monthly recurring Domo users | % of VFSs sharing metrics in Team of Teams per month | Platform analytics customer satisfaction | Customer  support velocity |
| KPI      | % of VFSs with KPIs tracked |                              |                                                      |                                          | Number of analytics bugs   |
