### Calculating Net Promoter Score

Employee Net Promoter Score is calculated by segmenting respondents into three categories based on their opinion of your company:

- **9-10 – Promoters:** These are happy and loyal employees who love your company and are likely to refer it to their friends.
- **7-8 – Passives:** They are those who have little enthusiasm about your company and are not likely to recommend it to others.
- **0-6 – Detractors:** They are unhappy with the company and are likely to damage your brand reputation with negative word-to-mouth.

From here, working out the eNPS is just a matter of subtracting the percentage of detractors from percentage of promoters.

**eNPS = (% of Promoters) – (% of Detractors)**After this, you’re left with a positive or negative score of between -100 and 100.

**VFS Feedback**
