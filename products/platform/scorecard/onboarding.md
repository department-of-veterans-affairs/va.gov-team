# Architecture
* [Request for comment](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/engineering/request-for-comment)
  * This seems like a thing similar to an ADR - it is a list of proposed engineering changes/practices. One example is the [decisions around tech stack for vets.gov/va.gov](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/request-for-comment/languages-and-tech-stack.md)
* [some useful descriptions of the CMS integration for va.gov](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/request-for-comment/2019-09-30-cms-integration.md)

# Platform and devops
* [CI/CD Process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/backend/continuous-integration-process.md)
* [standard deployment process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/deployment.md)
* [Info on prometheus/statsD metrics](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/backend/sending-metrics-using-statsd.md)
