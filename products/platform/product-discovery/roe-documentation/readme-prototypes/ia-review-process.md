## <a id="howwellwork"></a>Review Process

IA support is available anytime you have questions or want to collaborate on your work, so don't hesitate to reach out at any time. Here are some key times in your work, where collaborating with IA can be helpful. Keeping us up to speed on your work will reduce the time needed for an IA review and reduce the risk of needing to do rework.

### Phase 1: Discovery

**In this phase:** You'll prioritize what problem there is to solve, define the problem space, key use cases, business pain points, desired goals and KPIs in pursuing a solution.



#### Research + Discovery Checkpoint / Design Intent Review (meeting)

- We can provide input and feedback on user research approach, review discussion guides and prototypes for navigation design and labeling, and look at how findability of your content/tool can be included as part of your research.
- If research is highly focused on findability, flow and navigation, we ask that you please include us in the sessions as well.
- Include us in research readouts so we can evolve your appropriately based on your findings.

### Phase 2: Define/Design

#### IA Review 1 

- We will provide feedback on page flow and navigational elements of designs and prototypes

- IA and writing need to work together, and as content evolves, it can impact the IA. Content elements are also used to determine pages names/URLs.

- If your project includes multiple content pages or complex content, we ask that you work with us during the writing process. We will provide feedback on how structuring content impacts IA.

## What is an IA review?

An IA review is part the process when working on the platform to ensure a consistent structure and experience is maintained for our users regardless of the number of people and teams building user experiences on VA.gov.

**Here are the key things evaluated in an IA review**

1. IA Structure - Where does the tool/content live within the overall structure of the site
2. URLs and page breadcrumbs - Does the URL and breadcrumb follow the correct IA and standards used across the site?
3. Primary entry points and high level user flow - What are the primary ways users will access the content/tool and where are they linked to within and after?
4. Navigational components - What changes are needed to global nav components (i.e. top nav, header, left nav, etc)
5. Crosslinking opportunities - Are there opportunities to reference this content/tool in secondary placements across the site?
6. Redirects/canonical - Is there legacy or duplicative content that needs to be handled?
