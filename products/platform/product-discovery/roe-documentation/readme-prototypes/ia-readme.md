## How We Can Support You

*”Information Architecture focuses on organizing, structuring, and labeling content…The goal is to help users find information and complete tasks.“* - Usability.gov

**There are 2 primary focus areas of IA support on VSP**

1. **Site IA** = The overall structure and organization of all content and tools on VA.gov. The structure impacts content design, page flow, URLs, labeling and SEO. We also help ensure proper redirects and/or vanity URLs are in place if needed.

2.  **Navigation Design** = The flow, labeling and experience of all navigation elements and the identification of primary entry points and key cross-linking opportunities. This includes top and left navigation components, home and hub page links, the breadcrumb, footer links, related link components, inline content links, etc. 

### When should you think about IA?
