# Research Plan - ReadMe Guidelines



## Goals

#### Background: 

User research on documentation found VFS teams are building their own link aggregator pages in order to access the relevant documentation from our repository. Additionally, VFS teams said having a high-level view of the tasks they will be asked to do throughout the product development lifecycle showing where and why they fit in to the big picture would be helpful.

#### Insights we hope to derive in asking these questions:

How might we encourage findability / searchability of documents so that VFS team members can find it when they need it?



## Hypothesis

Updating ReadMe’s for each practice area according to the guidelines used to build the prototypes will make it easier for VFS team to find relevant documentation in the va.gov-team repo.



## Method

Usability testing with prototypes

- 5 remote interviews with VFS designer/researchers
- Tool: Zoom to record

We are looking to get feedback on the effectiveness of the re-formatted ReadMe files in the va.gov-team/platform Github folder as an interim step before the Platform Documentation Site is ready.



## Participants and Recruitment

We will be recruiting Designers / Researchers on various VFS teams. We will target a mix of people that are at different points in the product development process.



## When?

We plan to conduct the research in Sprint 18. To prepare, we will create a prototype ReadMe for the following practice areas:

- Research
- Design
- Content & IA
- Accessibility

Each session will be scheduled for 1 hour. A pilot session will be conducted. Participants TBD.



## Team Roles

- Moderator: Naomi Marcussen
- Research guide writing and task development: Naomi Marcussen, James Chasia
- Participant recruiting & screening: Naomi Marcussen, James Chasia
- Project point of contact: Naomi Marcussen, James Chasia
- Participant(s) for pilot test: TBD
- Note-takers: James Chasia, Emily Waggoner (1 notetaker per session - trade off per session)
- Observers: James Chasia, Crystabel Reiter, Emily Waggoner, Content & IA, Accessibility



## Research Questions

#### Introduction

1. How long have you worked on veteran-facing tools?
2. What product are you currently working on?
3. What stage of the product development lifecycle are you in?

#### Process Understanding

1. Tell me about how you’ve worked with the Platform/VSP team so far
   - Have you had any reviews?
   - How did you request that?
   - Did you know what was expected of you for that review?
2. Tell me about a time that you were looking for documentation?
   - What were you looking for?
   - Did you find what you were looking for?
   - Are there things that you think would be useful to add?
   - What would you want to change about the experience?

#### Prototype

[Show participant list of links]

- Content
- IA
- Research
- Design
- Accessibility

1. Thinking about the time you needed to reference documentation, take a look at this document and select the category where you might find the info you were looking for.
2. Tell me about what you see here
   - Is it clear how you would work with this practice area?
   - Can you tell me when you would request your next review with the Platform/VSP team?
   - Were you able to scan it easily or is there too much info?
