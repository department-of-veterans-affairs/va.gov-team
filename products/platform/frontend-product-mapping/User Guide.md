## Version 0.1

## Description
The current version of this product offers visibility to identity what endpoints (vets-api only) frontend applications are utilizing in their applications.  The mapping is stored in Grafana and is derived using a header (Source app name) that is appended to to each request.

## Current Limitations
The current implementation does provide insights, however the strategy that is currently in place does results in unknown and undefined requests that will be addressed in later releases.
