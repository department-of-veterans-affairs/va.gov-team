# GitHub Actions
Continuous Integration (CI) for VSP will be implemented using GitHub Actions (GHA) which allows developers to automate, customize, and execute software development workflows directly within their applicationâ€™s repository. GHA also provides an intuitive UI so that developers can easily visualize their CI workflows, and manage various stages of the testing and integration pipelines.

The switch to GHA from Jenkins was enforced for vets-api on 6/25/21. Instead of the `continuous-integration/jenkins/pr-head` being required, now `Code Checks / Test` and `Code Checks / Linting and Security` are required.
