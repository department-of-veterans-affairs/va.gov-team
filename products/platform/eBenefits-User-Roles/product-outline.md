# e-Benefits User Roles Product Outline

## Overview
This product will allow for someone other than a Veteran the ability to log in to VA.gov and be identified as a dependent, spouse, or power of attorney and see information pertaining to only them based on the Veteran they are associated with.

## Problem Statement
The login experience on VA.gov today is tailored specifically to the Veteran persona. We're at the point now, where in order to continue expanding the VA.gov experience to meet additional use cases, we need to expand identity to work for more personas who might be using VA.gov to do things on behalf of a Veteran or for themselves: Caregivers, Representatives, Dependents, and people who are multiple persona types at once (like someone who is both a Veteran and Dependent). There are limitations in the way the Identity solution is set up today, that prevents VA.gov teams from delivering functionality that adequately meets needs of these new personas and use cases.

## Personas
* Dependent
* Spouse
* POA

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

KPIs TBD

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

_Describe, in a few sentences and/or bullet points, what you plan to build, and how it will solve the problem. Some questions to think about:_

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

_For non-trivial technical solutions, an [engineering design doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/engineering/design-docs) should be written to deeply explain **How** this product will be built._
