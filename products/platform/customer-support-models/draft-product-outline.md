 # VSP Customer Support [Draft]

 ## Overview

A set of standard methods for how VSP engages with customers across communication channels and touchpoints to provide a consistent and positive experience where VFS 
teams get what seems like simple, straightforward answers to a variety of complex questions via documentation, interactions in Slack, or tools and shared code that helps accelerate their work.

 ## Problem Statement

 VFS teams find it difficult to understand how best to engage with VSP support resources and where to go to get guidance on platform best practices at different points in their user journey. VSP teams receive customer support requests of widely varying nature and complexity which makes it challenging to provide a consistent support experience to VFS teams.

 How might we provide VFS teams with an experience where at every point in their user journey it is clear to them what to expect when requesting support from VSP no matter the nature or complexity of their request?
