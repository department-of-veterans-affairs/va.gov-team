# Customer Support Models [Draft]

## Overview

 A set of plug and play customer support models that enable VSP to consistently provide high quality support while establishing self-service pathways that work for different types of VFS teams

## Problem Statement

In order to scale the platform to comfortably support 50+ VFS teams, VSP needs standard E2E support models for the most common customer segments. Our research on VSP team members determined they receive and handle support requests in a wide variety of ways. For VFS teams, our research shows a recurring pain point is a lack of understanding of why and how to engage with VSP at different points in their user journey on the platform.

## Personas
