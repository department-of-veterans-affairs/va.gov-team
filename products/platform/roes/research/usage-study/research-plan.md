Service Design Team - 10/21/2019

**Research Plan for Rules of Engagement (ROE)**  

**Goals**
Our goal is to 1) understand the landscape of documentation of ROEs and how they are being used today 2) define requirements for a template to document ROEs that establish how VFS and VSP teams interact throughout the product development lifecycle.   

Background: 
VSP teams currently organically develop and document ROEs. 
ROE documentation in Github and Zenhub (as of 10/9) 
Insights we hope to derive in asking these questions:

**Finability**
- Do people know ROEs exist for their practice area?
- Can people find them when they need them?
- How do people find them today?
What information is useful in an ROE (per practice area)?
Are teams who are aware of ROEs more likely to exhibit the behavior outlined in them?
What will make teams more likely to find and follow the ROE’s?
Are VSP Team members fluent on ROEs across all areas, and thus know how VSP functions as a whole? Would people be able to say “oh, that’s not the way we do it here” if they saw a VFS team doing something that’s not aligned with our ROE?
What practice areas still need to create an ROE?
**Effectiveness**

Hypothesis
ROE documents will provide VFS teams with relevant, valuable information.
ROEs help teams operate in alignment with VSP objectives.
VFS teams don’t know about then which contributes to them not following the way we’d like to work together.
Method
Survey VSP team members regarding ROE documents.
Tool: Optimal Sort
8 remote interviews with 4 VFS teams, 2 people from each 
Tool: Zoom to record
We will use surveys to measure the gaps in understanding and completion of ROE documents.  Interviews will allow us to ask qualitative questions and gain a deep understanding of the effectiveness of ROEs throughout the VFS user journey. 
 
Research Questions

Tools & Improvements
Operations
What is your practice area?
Accessibility

Operations
QA
Research
Without searching, do you think an ROE document exists for your practice area?
Yes
No
I don’t know
Have you ever contributed to an ROE? 
Yes
No
If yes, how did you decide what to include?
Are VFS teams using your docs?
Yes
No
I don’t know
If yes/no/don’t know: how do you know?


Interview questions for VFS team members:
How long have you worked on veteran-facing tools?
What do a Rules of Engagement document mean to you?
What would you expect from this type of document?
Have you worked with a Rules of Engagement document before?
If yes, were they helpful?
Are you aware that an ROE for your practice area exists? 
If yes, have you read it before? 
Have you gone back to refer to it at any point in the process?
What prompted you to go back to it?
Were you able to find it again?
Was it helpful? Did you find what you were looking for? 
If not, what was missing? What questions did you still have after? What steps did you take to get your remaining questions answered?
What would you add or change, if anything?
Do you feel that having this document helped the process go more smoothly with the VSP team? How?
 
Participants and Recruitment
Survey
We will send a survey to all VSP team members
How do I do this? Optimal Sort - Create New Study
 
Interviews
We will recruit the following VFS team participants for 30 min interviews:
Who should I contact for volunteers?
Where do we take notes?
VSA, Authenticated Experience Team 
(has both new and experienced team members, and experienced client) 
Samara Strauss - UX Designer DSVA (VSA-Authenticated Experience AUTHD-EXP)
1 volunteer (ask product manager - Justin Pickett)
ByLight, User Notifications Team 
(has only new team members, semi-experienced client) 
2 volunteers (ask Dorothy Biederman)
VAOS, Online Scheduling Team 
(mostly experienced team members, but very new client, engineering heavy) 
Mark Greenburg - Product Manager
1 volunteer (ask Mark for another volunteer)
Benefits + Memorials 
(mostly new team members, very green PM, experienced client) 
Silvio Luthi - Engineer
Kevin Statura - Designer

When?
Start interviews with VFS and VSP teams October 17 - 29, 2019.
