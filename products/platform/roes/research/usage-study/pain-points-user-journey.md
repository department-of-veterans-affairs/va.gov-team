| Onboarding      | Getting new team members access to things can take a lot of time. | I still have multiple engineers on my team that doesn't have socket access and that's a problem. There's a certain amount of access an engineer needs before they’re useful. We’re still waiting on PIV access which is insane, there’s a lot of kinds of blockers that are out of our hands | [ROE Interview Notes - P2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/roes/research/usage-study/notes/p2.md) |
| Onboarding      | Understanding the best way to setup my computer for the project. | I wish I’d setup my slack, github on my non-GFE computer so I don’t have to go through the VPN and can’t use the desktop versions.  Testing is done in a staging environment accessible from another computer.  Didn’t know to ask. | [ROE Interview Notes - P5](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/roes/research/usage-study/notes/p5.md) |
| Onboarding      | Lack of practice-specific onboarding                         | "There was not enough design-specific onboarding.  Platform and VSA design meetings are helpful.  Shawna personal guidance on Slack (DSVA design channel, vsa-design channel, gcio ux in ad hoc) also very helpful to understand high-level design.  Now gaining understanding at a more granular level." | [ROE Interview Notes - P3](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/roes/research/usage-study/notes/p3.md) |
| Onboarding      | The learning curve is steep for developers.                  | For devs who haven't worked on the VA.gov platform before, it takes a long time before they feel they can work at their normal pace. They needed to start contributing to their projects faster than they were able to completely finish setting up their machines and learning necessary processes. | [Research Roundup - Q3](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsp/teams/leadership/research/research-roundup-q3.md) |
| Post Onboarding | People feel supported and confident  coming out of onboarding but start feeling overwhelmed when they are on their own. | DELUGE of information, provided in so many different places.                                        I received a lot of information in multiple meetings but it was confusing how it all went together.                                                     I think the kickoff meeting could have provided more clarity.                              “Wasn’t really a ramp up period because we needed to get things done.” | [Research Roundup - Q3](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsp/teams/leadership/research/research-roundup-q3.md)         [ROE Interview Notes - P6](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/roes/research/usage-study/notes/p6.md) |
| Define          | Finding documentation when you need it                       | "Documents need to be searchable."  “Most documentation is pretty dispersed.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         It was all there, but not knowing what a lot of it meant, by the time you need to actually use the information you can't remember where it was located in the documentation."                                                                                                "How do you go back and find it? "I'm a little embarrassed to say I just keep the tab up."                                                                                                                                                                                    "Found research templates by digging through product research folders, then asked Shawna if it was a good example. | Multiple ROE Interview Participants                          |
| Define          | Knowing where to find the "source of truth"                  | Make it easier to know what the "source of truth" is for research and design materials.                              "I guess I don't know of anywhere it would make sense primarily for single source of truth for design type stuff. I don't quite know." | [ROE Interview Notes - P1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/roes/research/usage-study/notes/p1.md) |
| Define          | Broken links                                                 | Encountered broken links in the guidelines doc (google sheet) used for starting a research plan, research synthesis. | [ROE Interview Notes - P1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/roes/research/usage-study/notes/p1.md) |
| Define          | Differing terminology in documentation                       | Documents should use standardized terminology, i.e. opportunity areas, key themes, recommendations, takeaways | [ROE Interview Notes - P1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/roes/research/usage-study/notes/p1.md) |
| Define          | Unclear on expectations for research deliverables            | Standardize process for research synthesis - set expectations on research deliverables (readout, affinity mapping, etc) | [ROE Interview Notes - P1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/roes/research/usage-study/notes/p1.md) |
| Define          | Lacked a full understanding of ROEs at the beginning.        | Establishing ROEs for the team at the beginning: Maybe this was missed during onboarding. It was laid out but we did not have a good understanding when we started working on the product. | [ROE Interview Notes - P6](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/roes/research/usage-study/notes/p6.md) |
| Discover        | Keeping documentation up-to-date                             | "The challenge is the design system is always evolving.  It is not a set of rules you just memorize."         "It's hard to keep documentation up-to-date." | Multiple ROE Interview Participants                          |
| Build           | Not a 1:1 match between a design file and how it is implemented on the live website. | "See how design system elements translated to a live site.  Not 1:1 match between design file and how it is implemented on the live site.  There is room for creativity where you can propose new things but there’s also confusion." | [ROE Interview Notes - P3](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/roes/research/usage-study/notes/p3.md) |
| Validate        | Pressure to skip steps in process to deploy fixes faster.    | Documentation for post launch process for releasing fixes/refinements so everyone  understanding process of re-doing steps - do we need to each step again?  There is pressure from the VA to get fix out asap so people want to put the process aside | [ROE Interview Notes - P6](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/roes/research/usage-study/notes/p6.md) |
