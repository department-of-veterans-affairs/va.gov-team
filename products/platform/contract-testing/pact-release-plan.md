# Contract Testing: Pact Release Plan (DRAFT)

---

## Phase I: moderated production testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)

_For moderated production testing, we will run 1-2 moderated tests of VFS team PACT integration._

### Planning:
- Desired date range or test duration: early September 2020
- Desired number of users: at least 1 developer pair (FE/BE devs on the same team); preferably 2
- How you'll recruit the right production test users: announce in ToT paired with an ask in #vfs-all-teams and in engineering channel â€” "Do any VFS developers (preferably a BE/FE developer pair want) to work with us on moderated testing for PACT?"
- How you'll conduct the testing: Zoom & documentation links in va.gov-team 
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: N/A

### Success in moderated testing: 
_We will know we're ready for full rollout when ..._ 
- We've updated documentation to address all questions that arose in moderated testing
- Qualitative feedback on PACT 

### Results:
- Number of users: x
- Number of bugs identified / fixed: x/x
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum

## Phase II: Staged Rollout (also known as unmoderated production testing)

_We do not intend to do a staged rollout for PACT. We believe that moderated testing (above) will be sufficient to identify any issues before full rollout._

## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
