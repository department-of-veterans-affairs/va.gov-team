# VSP Product Outline Template

# Platform Orientation

## Overview
*When a new VFS team joins or a new person joins a VFS team, Platform conducts platform orientation (a series of meetings and reading material) to introduce VFS teams to processes, standards and expectations of developing on platform.*

## Problem Statement
The platform ecosystem is robust and it can be a confusing experience for new VFS teams or team member to jump into developing on Platform.

## Personas
Brand new VFS teams
New VFS team members on existing teams
Platform practice area specialists

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_

* Reduction in number of hours per sprint dedicated to hosting orientation meetings
* Reduction in quantity of questions per sprint on #vfs-platform-support relevant to "where do I find..." or "how do I..."?
* Reduction in quantity of questions on #vfs-platform-support from new VFS team members

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics, if possible._

## Assumptions

## Solution Approach

We are creating a one-stop shop/self-service tool/landing page for Platform Website that has all of the guidance and documentation VFS team members will need to start supporting their VFS team on VA.gov. The content of this landing page will be organized by VFS team member roles (General, PM, BE Engineer, FE Engineer, Designer/Researcher). Content will live in it's appropriate location on Platform Website, however it will be linked/accessible from the landing page. 

We are starting here because this approach will allow us to determine which content is valuable for VFS teams. Some of this content may already exist on Platform Website, and therefore can be easily referenced on the landing page. For the content that does not already exist on Platform Website, the appropriate owner will be identified and a ticket will be added to that teams backlog so that content can then be migrated from github or created.

To ensure content remains up to date, the acceptance criteria on the Platform initiative outlines will be modified. Platform teams will be asked to verify that the release of their product/iteration does not impact Platform Orientation documentation. If it does, they will need to update the documentation appropriately before release of their product.

There is currently a [New Team VSP Orientation Epic template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=orientation-epic.md&title=New+Team+VSP+Orientation) that is used for brand new teams and new VFS team members on existing teams. This ticket will be modified to reflect the responsibilities of a brand new team only. Another ticket will be created for new team members on existing teams that will be an abbreviated version. There is also [VFS Orientation Epic template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=vsp-product-support&template=vfs-onboarding-epic.md&title=Orientation+for+______+Team) that is used by Platform Product Support to manage orientation from the Platform perspecive. Valueable information from this ticket can be merged with the New Team VSP Orientation Epic template and this template can be archived.

We are taking this solution/approach over others because it allows us to separate the solution for new team orientation from new team member orientation. New team members and new teams can both benefit from this landing page, however new teams will still need a different, more personal approach to orientation. We still plan to have orientation meetings for new team members, however they can be modified and/or abbreiviated so they only cover what is not included in the landing page.

The solution/approach may evolve to include other content and/or valuable information from other non-platform teams. For example, Lighthouse or VANotify.
