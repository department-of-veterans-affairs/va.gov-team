# Customer Segmentation [Draft]

## Overview

Currently VSP does not have a model that groups VFS teams based on common characteristics so we can understand how to serve each group appropriately and effectively.

## Problem Statement

The Service Design team's Collaboration Cycle research showed that two acute pain points for VFS teams are 1) the process is one-size-fits-all that doesn’t work for all projects and 2) it slows them down. We heard from VSP teams that it is difficult to identify what types of new documentation would be most impactful to VFS teams because of their diverse needs.

## Personas

VSP teams and leadership, DEPO

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- The number of VSP initiatives targeting specific customer segments.
- Increase in overall customer satisfaction.

------

## Assumptions

- Creating customer segments will help us find opportunities to improve the Collaboration Cycle and documentation efforts.

## Solution Approach

- Conducted a series of workshops with DEPO and VFS Product Mgrs, where participants identified dimensions they felt impacted their work
- In each workshop, participants created a model using these dimensions to describe projects they have worked on. We asked them to consider the most common, most easy, most difficult, or most unique efforts. 
- From these inputs we are generating a set of segments.
- Then we will define the most common segments, based on amount of projects that align with those, to target for optimization in collaboration with other VSP teams.
