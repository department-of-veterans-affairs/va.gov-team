# Web Performance Monitoring v0.2
Provide standards and monitoring to help measure, evaluate, and govern website performance. 

## Performance Standards
In order to track and monitor performance VSP has researched and documented a list of success metrics along with recommended thresholds that webpages should meet.

List of [Performance Metrics and Thresholds](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/frontend/speedcurve/performance-standards.md#metrics)

## Performance Monitoring
By leveraging the software application, [SpeedCurve](https://www.speedcurve.com), VA will monitor and track the top 10 landing pages on va.gov weekly against our performance standards. Alerts will generate if any of the pages dips below the performance metrics. The FE Tools team will then triage and optimize sub-performing webpages.
All applications launching on the platform will go through performance testing to ensure it meets the VA's performance standards

[Why did we choose Speedcurve?](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/web-perf-monitoring/web-perf-monitoring-product-outline.md)

### Track Performance
- Teams will have access to a performance budget dashboard which tracks their performance each week against [VSP standard performacne metrics](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/frontend/speedcurve/performance-standards.md#metrics)

### Test Performance
- Speedcurve allows teams to easily test the performacne impact of new code through their "Changes" and "Benchmarking" capabilities. 

### Optimize Performance
- Speedcurve provides an emmense amount of detail to help quickly identify the root of performance issues.
  - Slowest and Largest Requests
  - 3rd party blocking Requests and Long Tasks
  - Hero Rendering Times
  - Rendering Times
  - Page Load Times
  - Time to interactive
- Speedcurve includes the full suite of Lighthouse Audit scores and recommended optimizations
