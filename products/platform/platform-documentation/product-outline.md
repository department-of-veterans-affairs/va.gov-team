# Platform Documentation Site: Product Outline

## Overview
VA.gov platform documentation (aka "VFS-facing documentation") houses platform, team, product, and development information for VA.gov application teams (aka "VFS teams").  Currently, platform documentation exists on a variety of tooling solutions and code repositories, all loosely consolidated by [The Home Page MVP](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va.gov-team/) and [The Gatsby Site](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/).

## Problem Statement 

VSP has created a myriad of documentation to help our customers (i.e. VFS teams) work seamlessly and iteratively to build great products.  However, platform documentation is a not easily navigable and frequently not actionable, which:
- Causes a large support burden for VSP, therefore 
- Frustrating our customers, and 
- Potentially resulting in products on VA.gov that don't meet VSP standards. 

_HMW leverage Confluence to improve the info findability for VFS teams?_

## Personas
* VFS developers
* VFS PMs and POs (out of scope for pilot)
* VFS designers and content writers (out of scope for pilot)

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
For the 2020 Q4:
* VFS sentiment around proposed platform developer documentation

Overall:
* Volume of support requests
* Complexity of support given
* VSF sentiment around navigating and consuming Confluence content
 
#### Baseline KPI Values
- VFS sentiment around current platform documentation: [MURAL board](https://app.mural.co/t/adhocvetsgov9623/m/adhocvetsgov9623/1587506427611/4fb63eb007eadec05ce8634499699ff610706a7d)

## Assumptions

* Building out Confluence will lead to greater self-service and fewer support requests.
* Confluence will be easier for VFS teams to navigate and surface the resources they are looking for.
* The VSP team will be able to customize Confluence without undue burden.
 
## Solution Approach
This quarter (2020 Q4), the Content/IA team is running a pilot to identify how VFS developers prioritize and group tasks, in order to develop an IA that is easily navigable.

With the pilot, we can establish a process of uncovering and understanding VFS developers' task/categorization association, and apply this process to tasks that other practitioners perform.
