# Homepage MVP Release Plan

---

## Phase I: soft release to VSP

### Planning:
- Desired date range or test duration: Sprint 21-22 (during MVP build)
- Desired number of users: VSP (voluntary) - ideally feedback from 10+ users
- How you'll recruit the right production test users: solicit feedback in VSP Slack channels
- How you'll conduct the testing: mostly asynchronous feedback, may solicit feedback from folks in quick meetings
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: will be visible in a [sandbox](https://doc-landing-page-mvp-tisq4.csb.app/) or on GitHub page _(in other words, this will be live)_

### Results:
- Number of users: x
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum

## Phase II: (beta) release to VSP and VFS!

### Planning:
- Desired date range: release by end of Sprint 22/Sprint 23 (by end of March 2020), gather feedback throughout April
- Desired number of unique users: 200+
- How you'll make the product available in production while limiting the # of users who can find/access it: we will not limit access to the product; we will clarify that this is a beta site and we are looking for feedback. There is little-to-no risk to releasing an unfinished/imperfect product, and much to be gained from starting to get feedback.
- "Success" criteria (by the numbers):
  - Average uniques/day for April increase over time
  - Average uniques/day for April > 25
- Other KPIs & qualitative metrics: 
  - Average % of users who visit the site more than 1x/week _(need baseline)_
  - "Can't find what I'm looking for" engagement rate _(need baseline)_
  - Bounce rate (% of users who navigate away without clicking anything) _(need baseline)_
  - Qualitative survey results (end of April)
  
#### Assumptions and Hypotheses 
- Assumptions listed in [documentation site product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/documentation-site/product-outline.md)
- We *hypothesize* that a documentation homepage will improve the findability of key docs, reulting in fewer "non-human-needed" documentation support requests.
- We *hypothesize* that a documentation homepage will create a single source of truth for VA.gov's top used documentation, improving trustworthiness of docs.
- We *hypothesize* that a documentation homepage will allow us (as documentation maintainers) to begin gathering metrics on what content is most used, allowing us to craft a data-informed documentation maintenance strategy.

### 2-week results (target April 15):
- Number of unique users: x
- Actual results (per your "success criteria")
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum

### 1-month results (target end of April): 
_End of April we will send out a qualitative survey_

- Number of unique users: x
- Actual results (per your "success criteria")
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum
- Feedback from qualitative survey: 

## 1-month evaluation

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
