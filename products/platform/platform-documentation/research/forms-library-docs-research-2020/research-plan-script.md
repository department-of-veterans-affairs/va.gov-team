# VSP Research Plan for Content & IA Team, Forms Library Documentation, June 2020

## Goals	

### 1. What product [tool/service/document/process] & VSP team are you doing this research for? 

   - This research is for the [forms library documentation](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/forms/) on the Content and IA team, in collaboration with members of the Product Support and Front-End Tools teams.

### 2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? Link to the product outline.

The VA.gov Forms System is a library for developers to create forms on VA.gov using a configuration-based approach. The Forms System has a documentation site ([here](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/forms/)) that provides guidance and instructions for how to use it. However, the documentation is incomplete in some places, isn't totally clear in others, which leaves engineers on VFS teams with unanswered questions. VSP has heard feedback that this documentation is the most useful when a team first sets up and gets started on a project, but its usefulness deteriorates as the engineers develop their teams' unique forms. These are things we know, that we will _not_ be validating with this research.

At the same time, the Front-End Tools and Product Support teams are working on improving the Forms Library itself. One of the improvements includes a new type of supplemental documentation affectionately known as The Cookbook, where developers are provided a number of _recipes_ that show how building blocks of code can be assembled in different ways based on what they need to do. This research will validate the effectiveness of this new documentation approach, as well as the existing and proposed contents of the new documentatiion 

A few assumptions we are making that we believe are already validated, or are low-risk enough to _not_ spend this research validating:
- In general, there are usability problems with forms library documentation provided by VSP. 
- It aligns with a VFS user's mental model to organize all technical documentation related to building forms into a group
- It is appropriate to separate this technical documentation from other practices' forms-related documentation
- Engineers are aware of the forms system documentation and are able to find the general topic

Note that this product is a sub-product of VSP Content & IA's documentation site ([product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/documentation-site/product-outline.md)).

### 3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?
- What parts or characteristics of existing forms documentation are effective and helpful?
- How effective is The Cookbook for helping developers make decisions? 
   - Is the concept of The Cookbook transparent and understandable?
   - Is the recipe format clear and actionable?
   - Are the examples relevant to the developers' work?
   - What questions do developers have after reading these recipes?
   - What types of recipes are missing?
   - What other resources do developers use to supplement the recipes if they still have questions? 
   - What other resources should VSP provide to supplement The Cookbook?
- Meta: Does this research method work effectively for testing the usability of documentation?

### 3. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	

- We hypothesize that The Cookbook structure for forms library documentation will provide a resource to VFS teams that is robust, easy to understand, and efficient to use. 

## Method	

1. What method of research are you planning? 
   - We will use a combination of methods during a scheduled block of time with each participant:
      - Remote, directed interviews
      - Unmoderated diary studies
   
2. Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 
   - The Cookbook that we would like to test is currently in a Google Doc. Because the nature of reading documentation and using it in one's work is normally an independent activity that people complete at their own pace, we think that replicating that environment will be the best way to evaluate The Cookbook. We plan to create a version of the document that contains an instructional layer (using the Google Docs comments feature) that asks the participant questions about their experience at specific points in the document. We will create a copy of the document for each participant so that they can experience it without influence of others in the study. 
   - We would like to combine this diary study method with directed interviews so that we have the opportunity to introduce the activity in the context of the current forms system work, answer any questions the participants may have, and debrief with the participant after they've finished the activity. 
   - Here is how this semi-synchronous method would play out in a single session's agenda:
      - 15 minutes: Introduction, brief directed interview, provide instructions
      - 30 minutes: Participant completes diary study activity independently
      - 15 minutes: Post-activity directed interview with participant, wrap up

3. Where are you planning to do your research?
   1. We will use Zoom to conduct the synchronous portions of the session, and Google Docs for the diary study portion.
   
4. What will you be testing? 
   1. We will be testing the [The Cookbook which can be viewed here currently](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dUwWSk556QXdgORyTnP_42bdLr3Nhjv6Ga3aXZ_NKSc/edit#heading=h.uxamjboglia6). Copies of the document for each participant have not yet been created.

## Participants and Recruitment	

1.  Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant? (Mention: Number of participants, practice areas, VFS team, VFS product. Please keep in mind that we have a limited number of VFS teams, and we should avoid going to the same people and teams back-to-back.)
    1.  We would like to talk to 4-5 front-end developers from a variety of VFS teams working on a variety of forms. 
    2.  We will update this document when we have confirmation from all the participants.
2.  What is your recruitment strategy? (Usually it is a Slack message directly to the team or team members. Contact the Design Lead if you need help getting in touch with anyone.)	
    1.  We have already gotten a few volunteers for this research, but will reach out to other teams via their Slack channel.

## When? 	

1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	(Schedule your research at least 1 week in advance if possible to give your participants time to organize their calendars) 	
   1.	We will conduct this research during VSP Sprints 27 and 28, between approximately June 4-12, 2020.
2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	
   1.	It's ready!
3.	Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling: e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
   1.	We will schedule 1 hour with each participant.
4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.) that are hopefully flexible enough to accommodate our participants' busy schedules. Keep in mind that VFS team members are also remote and live in different time zones. Try and keep research sessions during normal working hours.	
   1.	Scheduling will be determined and updated here once we've identified all of our participants.


5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 

   1.	We will pilot the research with a front-end developer from a VFS team. The pilot will take place with participant RG on 6/4 at 1 pm.
