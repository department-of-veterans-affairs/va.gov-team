## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Emily and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about documentation for the Forms Library, and ask you to do a short activity that will help us evaluate some new documentation we've been working on. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about an hour** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. And we will *not* be on the video call for some of it. I'll explain more about that shortly.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet developersâ€™ needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 
*Start recording.*
- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record the screen the audio as we talk today?**

## Pre-activity interview: Evaluation of current forms documentation

- Before we get started with the activity, I have a few questions about our current forms library documentation. Are you familiar with it?
- When is the last time you referenced it?
- Was it useful then? Why or why not?
- If not:
    - Can you give an example of a time the documentation was useful?
    - What made it useful, specifically?
    - Are there any useful types of documentation or formats that you would like to see in the forms library documentation?
- What documents, if any, do you reference to supplement the information provided in the forms library documentation?
- Are there any other thoughts you have about the current forms library documentation?

Alright! Thank you so much for that input, that is really helpful for us to hear. Now we're going to transition to the activity and I'll start by sharing my screen and going over the instructions.

_Moderator: Navigate to guided documentation for participant, share screen_

## Diary study activity: Guided documentation

- Can you see my screen okay?
- So what you are looking at here is a Google doc that has a series common examples of form components and instructions on how to fit all the parts together. As the title suggests, we're considering this a "quick reference guide" for common problems developers need to solve when building forms on VA.gov. We expect that this quick reference guide will eventually be paired with other documentation such as an introduction to the forms library, but today we're hoping to get your feedback on the approach we're taking with the quick reference guide. 
- In addition, you'll notice that throughout the Google doc, there are comments in the sidebar providing an _additional_ layer of instructions and asking you questions and asking for your feedback about the document.
- What we're asking you to do for the next 30 minutes is to follow the instructions in the [blue box] and in the comments throughout this document. We'll end the video call and let you do this asynchronously on your own, and then after 30 minutes we'll come back together and wrap up. If you get stuck or run into trouble, that is totally okay! There's nothing you can do wrong here, and anything you experience is helpful for us to improve these documents. However, if you get _really_ stuck and need to "phone a friend," we have set up this DM in Slack with you - please send us a message there and we can come back together. 
- I'll keep a timer for 30 minutes, and then re-open our Zoom link so that we can ask you a couple more questions and wrap up. I will send the zoom link to our DM after 30 minutes have passed. 
- If you finish before 30 minutes is up, send a message to that same group DM and we can re-convene a little early. And if you don't finish all of the tasks in this time period, that is also totally okay. We want to be respectful of your time and not keep you longer than our allotted hour. 
- Do you have any questions so far?
- Okay, let's look at the first task together to make sure we're all on the same page.

_Scroll down to first task_

_Read task aloud_

_Demonstrate adding a comment with the response_

_Send participant the link_

- Can you access the document? _Confirm they can get into the doc_
- What questions do you have before we let you get to it?

Okay, unless we hear from you in the direct message, we'll see you in 30 minutes.

_End the zoom call_

_Start 30 minute timer_

_Monitor Slack DM to field for questions or messages from the participant_

_After 30 minutes, send message to group DM with zoom link prompting everyone to re-join the Zoom call._

## Post-activity interview

Okay we are back! I am going to begin the recording again.

_Begin recording again_

We just have a few more questions for you to wrap us up.

- What is your general reaction to this style of reference documentation? Not the Google doc activity, but the contents of the documentation itself.
- What questions do you have after reading the reference documentation?
- Are the code examples complete and accurate?
- Are these examples clear on when to use each one?
- Have you run into any tasks that could use an example in this structure?
    _May be addressed in 3rd async task_
- Does this seem different to you than the existing documentation that you reference? Please explain.
- Do you have any other thoughts or feedback you'd like to share before we wrap up?
- Is there anyone else you think we should talk to about this?
- Please send any links that you mentioned to our group DM in Slack
- We will take a look at your comments in the document and may follow-up with you if we have additional questions.
- Use this documentation over the next week and add comments and thoughts about how it's useful or could be improved. We'll check in with you via our DM to follow up next week.

## Thank-You and Closing

Thank you so much for doing this with us. Your input it really valuable and helps shape the type of support that we give to VFS teams, and we really appreciate your time.

Have a great day!
