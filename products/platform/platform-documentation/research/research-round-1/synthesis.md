# Synthesis notes

### Many people who are onboarding onto a new project/program are motivated to learn the work practices, tools, and current status of the project.

- P1: Did some experimenting on his on and found some online guides (to learn Github)
- P3: They had running notes - it was a lot but she read it all (in response to "Has documentation played a role in onboarding to this new project?")
- P6: Later on she discovered how much value was in github threads. Now that she is doing structural organization of her community, she is finding a lot of historical context through the github comments
- P6: Then she would jump to work practices and post mortems - "they're juicy"
- P7: Meeting notes he finds helpful - if I'm interested in one product specifically he will dig into meeting notes overtime to get a quick understanding of what it's about

### But not all:

- P9: "It's good to be ignorant because you challenge decisions. Either re-enforces decisions or provides opportunities to improve."

### Even though they are motivated to integrate to the team quickly, they benefit by having an onboarding buddy to shepherd them through the process.

- P1: Would have benefited by partnering or connecting with someone else from the team - someone that had been on the team for a while.
- P3: Had a negative onboarding experience when there is no structure at all. Having clear responsibilities is important so people don't just interpret whatever they want.
- P4: "docs were in several places and couldn't really get through it without help"
- P5: "[Onboarding has been] great because the people have been great. More on the unstructured side, like a puzzle."
- P6: "Talking with people was my first step"
- P6: "They showed me a repo and I had to guess what I needed. The convos with teammates were more helpful"
- P8: Had an onboarding buddy with a set of tasks to work through
- P9: Leaned on a bunch of his coworkers at 18f to get oriented

### People joining new teams want to begin making meaningful contributions as quickly as they can.

- P1: Felt like he could contribute quickly on the procurement training (on day 1) (in response to “What went well)
- P2: Looks for how to contribute next (2nd thing she did after scanning the readme - looked at open issues that are tagged with her practice area)
- P5: Wants to own the site and then press make/build to confirm that he can create on the site.
- P4: there were a series of github issues and wikis and things where they realized there were gaps and made updates
- P6: "Oo potential first actions" but the first item didn't interest her. "I want this to be higher actually"
- P7: for vets-website, built it locally and worked through the different dev, staging, prod environments. did exact same thing in vets-api.
- P7: learn some stuff by doing things on the repo
- P8: Feels like he would be able to get up and off the ground running
- P8: The only [question] he can think of at the moment - is there anything that is currently in flight that needs to be picked up immediately, known issues that would be able to be tackled first

### USDS/18F folks believe in working in the open and urge their clients, stakeholders, agencies, to do the same. USDS/18F folks are motivated to create a culture of working in the open.

- P1: He is working to make this information more public. Crowd source and workshop with vendors to gather this information publicly
- P1: Pushing nat geo to open a public repo for their procurement

### People who are onboarding to a new project and familiar with Github will look for clues that indicate the health of the repo, which helps form the impression of the overall project:

- P2: “If a readme is well developed it shows that someone cares. If there isn't a well written readme, it is more like a holding place for information”
- P2: Would look for things that are recently updated
- P3: One of the first things she would do is test out the level of maturity of the project. 
- P3: (During scenario) "I would read all of the postmortems. Shows were friction points are, where the problems might be. Can learn a lot from them, would read newest ones first"
- P3: Can look at the modified dates and note that this is an ongoing practice
- P6: "There is a lot in USDS and a lot was out of date. Would be good to know what is still relevant vs. obsolete"
- P7: Final place he'll go is to post mortem section - valuable to understand where failures have happened to prevent them in future
- P8: Right off the bat, sees number of issues open, quite a bit
- P8: Looks at when things were updated

### People who are onboarding want to get a sense of the overall, big picture before going deeper.

- P2: "Basically just trying to get an idea of the outer edges of the teams work and looking at what the most recent changes are."
- P3: (Regarding the readme) "Maybe a broader intro; dives quickly into specifics"
- P4: (During scenario, looking at overall repo readme) "I like a little bit about what the product vision is. I'd hope it's at the top of this"
- P4: "I think i don't understand what griffins, rainbows, etc? coooool, am I a griffin??" [Too detailed for first look at project]
- P4: "if I was curious, I'd like to be able to link more"
- P4: "i don't feel like i know much about the product and why it's there and who it's for"
- P5: "Definitely will read the readme"
- P5: "Overall impression - "there is a lot of detail here." "Would look at the outline"
- P6: Readme is "Too much to read right now"
- P7: If i didn't already have contextual knowledge, I'd dive into the work practices folder and then jump into engineering resources to get into engineering onboarding, technical overview, and how it comes together at the VA.
- P8: Jumps to general onboarding first to see if there is anything important

### When they are ready to go deeper, they want to find information about their specific practice area. They want to find where they fit in.

- P4: "I still don't see UX or something that feels like analytics"
- P5: [Clicked on Engineering Onboarding from overall readme]
- P5: Looks like all the things i'd expect [on BE engineering TOC]
- P6: "No one writes a reading list for me in my situation"
- P7: Would probably go through every link in developer workflow
- P8: Liked the Onboarding guide and how it ends with the practice areas and would go to engineering/devops readme

### A person's familiarity with Github can have a big impact on their onboarding experience

- P4: "i was a little surprised looking at this that it's all in github rather than like a static site that can mirror github. i'm comfortable looking at things in github and to me, the repo of it, sometimes means i would expect it to be an active dev project as opposed to a doc set"
- P4: "i didn't realize this is the docs as well as the wiki site"
- P9: "'Let me send you a bunch of github links.' Had never heard of Github before working at 18f"
- P9: Learned to use terminal at first. "I have to do things over and over or else I forget"
- P9: At login.gov getting it running locally on the machine was crazy due to all it's dependencies. That was why Github was hard for him to learn. He would get frustrated when it fails and he would have to ping an engineer.

### People want to know who they can turn to if they need help.

- P5: Questions about WHO - who should I contact when I have a questions about this. "I'm trying to create a map of the system as well as a map of the people"
- P7: Would ask someone specifically like James/Patrick
- P7: If it was a broader question, he'd post in slack with follow ups or the convo would grow
- P8: Worked on Team API, getting a map of all the teammates, skills, and projects they worked on
- P9: "I'll just ask somebody"
- P9: Doesn't know who is doing what, doesn't know where to find it? What is the appeals team doing? What is the Unicorns team doing?

### When people lack guidance for information specific to them, they create their own reading list by opening links they think might be important in new tabs.

- P6: Going to start opening things in new tabs see if anything catches my eye
- P8: Opens Wiki, projects, issues in tabs

### For some folks, documentation doesn't fit with their learning style and they may ignore it entirely.

- P9: [In response to "What role did documentation play in your onboarding?"] "None, I don't read. I'm a visual learner."
- P9: He didn't have time when he was onboarding to read and dig through it
- P9: "Pictures speak a thousand words. That's just how I learn"
