# Research Plan for Platypus Tools Team

## Goals
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?
    - The Platypus Platform Tools team.
    - The product is the Platform documentation.
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 
    - The Platypus Tools team has been working to organize, improve, and categorize the wide range of documentation that we have amassed to enable teams to design and build products for VA.gov.
    - We have created master tables of contents within each practice area to make our documentation easier to navigate.
3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 
    - Can members of a cross-functional product development team with no prior experience working on VA.gov find the information they need to deliver successful products on VA.gov?
    - If a contractor has a question, can they find the answer in the documentation?
    - In your practice area, what is something you would do on your first day?
    - Practice-area specific questions:
        - **Product** How would you set up your first product outline?
        - **Research** Show me how you would find out how to recruit research participants for a usability study.
        - **Design** How would you find out what design tools are available?
        - **Accessibility** How would you find out how to request an accessiblity QA check?
        - **Devops** How would you find out more about the code review and reslease process?
        - **Front-end** How would you set up to run the design system locally?
        - **Back-end** How would you find out more about the load testing process?
4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 
    - Up to this point, we have heard that our documentation is extensive but it can be difficult to know where to start. We anticipate that the master table of contents we've built will help teams have an understanding of what is available, and point them in the right direction.
    
## Method
1.	What method of research are you planning? 
     - Moderated, in-person usability.
  
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 
     - We would like to be able to observe the steps people take as they navigate the documentation, and ask them questions throughout the sessions about their thought processes, stress levels, emotional states, etc. 

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? 
     - In person at USDS, 18F, and VA.

4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* \
     - We will be testing markdown files hosted here in GitHub:
         - [Front-end Readme](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/frontend/readme.md)
         - [Back-end Readme](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/backend/README.md)
         - [508/Accessibility Readme](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/README.md)
         - [Analytics Table of Contents](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/analytics/readme.md)
         - [QA Readme](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/quality-assurance/README.md)
         - [Content Readme](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/content/README.md)
         - [Product Readme](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/product-management/README.md)
         - [Design Readme](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/README.md)
         - [Information Architecture Table of Contents](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/information-architecture/README.md)
     

## Participants and Recruitment
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?
     - 6-8 participants
     - An even mix of men and women
     - Veteran/Servicemember status is _not_ required
     - Ideally, people who work in one of the following tech practice areas: UX design, UX research, content strategy, information architecture, product management, front-end developmemnt, back-end development, IT, QA, data analysis, development operations and security
     - The participants should not work on a VA.gov product team, and ideally have not previously worked on VA.gov.
     - The participants should have little to no familiarity with the product development process on VA.gov.

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 
     - Patrick and Leah to recruit employees of 18F and USDS
     - We also plan to set up a guerrilla-style research station to recruit people in the 18F and USDS offices as they have time to chat.

## When? 
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research?
