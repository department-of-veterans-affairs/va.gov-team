# Results Summary

## Background
The Platypus Tools team has been working to organize, improve, and categorize the wide range of documentation that we have amassed to enable teams to design and build products for VA.gov using the Veteran-facing Services Platform (VSP).

We conducted this follow-up research study to test the changes that we made after the previous usability study ([the results of which can be found here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/documentation-site/research/research-round-1/results-summary.md)). The changes that made to the vets.gov-team repo are as follows:
- Organizing the content into three main buckets:
	- Administrative (for general information about work practices and organizational culture)
	- Practice Areas - information about how each specific practice area works
	- Products - information about the digital products and services built on va.gov.
- Adding a table of contents to each practice area readme
- Rewriting the main vets.gov-team readme

## Goals

We wanted to answer the following questions:

- Can members of a cross-functional product development team with no prior experience working on VA.gov find the information they need to deliver successful products on VA.gov?
- If a contractor has a question, can they find the answer in the documentation?
- If they cannot find the answer, do they know who to contact?
- Can participants find a direct path to their specific practice area’s folder without help?
- Do participants have a sense of the overall purpose of the project, and their place in it?

We gave participants the following scenario: 

>We are going to pretend that you are a [developer, designer, researcher, whichever practice area they are] on the new contractor team coming to work on the VSP. This project has been going on for years, and your team is taking over for the previous contractor. Today is your team's first day.

In this follow-up study, we did not include an interview portion that focused on learning participants’ experiences with on boarding and documentation. 

## Method
- Moderated, in-person usability testing.
- Ad Hoc’s annual retreat was in Baltimore, Maryland from May 5-7. On the morning of May 6, we held the usability sessions during the science fair, and recruited people as they strolled by. 
- We held 8 sessions that averaged about 10 minutes each.

### Dates

May 6, 2019

### Participants

We had 8 participants from Ad Hoc who do _not_ currently work on the VA.gov platform, apps, or website teams. The participants held the following practice areas:
- Research
- Back-end engineering
- Product management
- Front-end engineering
- Design

Out of the 8 participants, 3 were women and 5 were men. Some were familiar with the Vets.gov/VA.gov project. One participant had more moderate knowledge of the project because he had worked on Vets.gov several years ago, and one participant was a Veteran.

### What we did

We conducted 8 8-10 minute in-person moderated usability testing sessions using the vets.gov-team repo.

## Key Takeaways

### The funnel-shaped structure of the [main repo readme](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team) (broad, program-wide information first then narrowing down to more specific information) is an effective way to quickly ground a new team member to the overall effort and provide them with a path of where to go next.
- All participants indicated that they understood the purpose of the project overall
- 7 out of 8 participants were able to identify where they would fit within the project

### Several participants mentioned that they wouldn’t trust the information about team structures if they were part of a new contracting team.
> How the teams were organized before doesn’t matter to me. I’d skim right over.

This information might be most useful for new members coming onto an existing contractor.

### _Onboarding_ is a key word that jumps out to new team members. 
5 out of 8 participants clicked on Onboarding links when they saw them. Acting as a member of a new contracting team, documents labeled with "Onboarding" jumped out as essential to getting the lay of the land.
> Onboarding - that’s where I would click
> Onboarding. This is what I was looking for. Who’s who. This is what I’m looking for.

### 7 out of 8 participants were able to find their practice area readme. 
- Though they didn’t all take the most direct route, once they found information specific to their practice area, many participants seemed to relax, smile and recognize that they found their place in the program.

> Wow. This is great. It feels like you could go down this list. I don’t think I’d need direction. It tells you exactly what you need to do. This is everything I need.
> I’d probably go through all of these docs.

### Highlighting the points of contact for each practice area gave participants confidence that they had someone to turn to if they needed help.

> I saw there were a few places to reach out to people
> Who’s who. This is what I’m looking for.

### Many of the key takeaways from the previous documentation research were reaffirmed:

#### Level of familiarity with Github can highly impact a person’s onboarding experience.
- [Link to previous finding](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/documentation-site/research/research-round-1/results-summary.md)
- Two participants used Github shortcuts to search for filenames containing keywords they felt were important, which created a shortcut to their practice area.
- One participant had never used Github before and was unaware that there was a readme below the list of folders. It took her much longer to find her practice area, and she indicated she would have needed to ask for help.
    - > I’m not finding anything... I’d reach out to someone on Slack: _Is there a link that someone else found useful?_

#### People who are onboarding to a new project and familiar with Github look for clues that indicate the health of the repo, which helps form their impression of the overall project.
- [Link to previous finding](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/documentation-site/research/research-round-1/results-summary.md)
- One participant went to the Projects tab seeking meeting notes and logged communication between stakeholders, decision makers, and contributors.
- One participant described that he would question the relevance of a file that had last been updated 6 months ago. 
    - > This doc was last updated in a meaningful manner on what date? Git allows tracking historical changes, but it depends on people writing good commit messages so I can get into their thought process.
    
#### Many people, but not all, who are onboarding onto a new project/program are motivated to learn the work practices, tools, and current status of the project.
- [Link to previous finding](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/documentation-site/research/research-round-1/results-summary.md)
- One participant described how she would read the Research history document to learn what research has been done, as well as the PI Readouts.
    - >[Clicks on History] Good to catch up. This is where I would start.
- One participant described how he would use the Projects tab to understand where things have left off.
    - >Looking for user stories, engineering tasks, operations from a project perspective
    - >I would look at past history in the project section
    
#### People who are onboarding want to get a sense of the overall, big picture before going deeper.
- [Link to previous finding](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/documentation-site/research/research-round-1/results-summary.md)
- 6 out of 8 participants demonstrated that they would take a few moments to read or skim the "background of the project" section of the main readme before searching for their particular practice area.
    - >I need context first. I don’t know a ton about VA.gov as a project.
- One of the participants that did not demonstrate this had previously worked on Vets.gov and had some familiarity with the project
- The other participant expressed she was looking for a "summary" or "umbrella document" but couldn't find it - she had also never used Github before this usability study.
    
### Other notable insights
- One participant mentioned that he would look for a list of common acronyms
- It did not seem problematic in any way for participants to jump between the Onboarding wiki and the rest of the documentation 

### Recommendations
- Consider creating a list of known acronyms to put in the Administrative folder
- Consider creating more robust Tables of Content on the main readme for the Administrative and Product folders
- Consider creating a VA.gov-specific "New to Github? Start here" guide that is present in the main directory and linked to from the main readme
- Bring the updates we've made thus far to the onboarding wiki content [currently in progress]
