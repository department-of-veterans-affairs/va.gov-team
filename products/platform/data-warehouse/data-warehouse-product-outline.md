# Data Warehouse Product Outline
---

## Overview
A data platform that is a source of truth for VA.gov and DEPO product platform performance and outcome data.

## Problem Statement
VA.gov website performance and usage data is scattered and silod across different data platforms. VSP needs a cohesive source of truth for its platform so that we can understand usage and success across our products. VFS teams need a source of truth for the VA.gov website performance and usage data so that they can easily and securely access analytics around their product's success.

How might we decrease data silos to create a source of truth and improve accuracy, use, and transparency of VA.gov data?

## Hypothesis
If we gather data in one place, we can:
- more quickly audit & clean data for PII and PHI security so that Veteran data is private & secure
- own VA.gov data so that we can clean and segment data ourselves and not a third party
- centralize VA.gov and DEPO platform analytics so that we can consume the data without spending a lot of time tracking the data
- access data we weren't able to without a data warehouse, like unsampled Google Analytics and historical website performance data

 
## Desired User Outcomes

- More data usage for product decision making

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Misuse or misunderstanding of data

## Desired Business Outcomes

- More transparency & fewer silos between VA offices

## Undesired Business Outcomes

## Assumptions
- we can get access to more data with a warehouse than not
- there's buy in for using VA data to make product decisions
- we have resources to make data connections
- the data warehouse is compatible with other data platforms

## Solution Approach

1. Connect the data we currently own
2. Gather and prioritize a database of VA.gov and VSP data platforms
3. ETL data to Domo for VFS and DEPO platform product dashboarding
4. (Stretch) Create APIs to open the data for VFS and other VA use
