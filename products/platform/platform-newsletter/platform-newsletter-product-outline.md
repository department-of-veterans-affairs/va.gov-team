# Platform Newsletter Product Outline

#### Communications

- Team Name: VSP Service Design and Content/IA
- Slack channel:  #platform-newsletter
- Product POCs: James Chasia, Naomi Marcussen

------

## Overview

Publish a periodic email newsletter publicizing platform improvements to ensure VFS teams and stakeholders are aware of them and can easily access relevant documentation.

## Problem Statement

VSP currrently communicates information to customers about improvements to platform features, services, and processes  largely through Slack.  We have heard from VFS teams that announcements on Slack are often missed or get lost resulting in delay and fustration as they run into avoidable issues or waste time searching for an old Slack message.  We have heard from VSP teams that these communication gaps lead to redudant support requests and negatively affect the perception of the platform by VFS teams as well as VA stakeholders.

*How might we improve VSP outgoing communications to keep pace with the scale of our operation?* 

## Desired User Outcomes

Every VFS team member and stakeholder is aware and understands improvements to platform features, services, and processes and as a result is less confused and frustrated about platform changes.

## Undesired User Outcomes

VFS teams are unaware of improvements to platform features, services, and processes inhibiting their ability to successfully build products for  VA.gov.

## Desired Business Outcomes

- Increased customer satisfaction and engagement.
- Accelerated awareness and adoption of platform features, services, and processes.

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- Customers view the communications as unhelpful.
- VSP is not sending a consistent message about platform features, services, and processes across channels.

## Risks

The risk from not addressing this problem is VSP will have an incomplete customer feedback loop where we are releasing improvements to the platform based on customer feedback but they are not aware of what we have done.

## Assumptions

- Creating a new communication channel (beyond Slack and Team of Teams) to share platform annoucements will increase  VFS team members' awareness of improvements to platform features, services, and processes.
- Sending a periodic email to VFS team members communicating platform improvements with links to relevant documentation will make it easier for them to refer back to information on platform features, services, and processes  as they are building on the platform. [Most Risky]

## Solution Approach

For the MVP, we plan to build and publish the initial edition of an email newsletter to VFS teams sharing information on recently released platform improvements.  The purpose of the MVP is to test if a periodic newsletter would be an effective new channel for VSP to communicate platform improvements to VFS teams and stakeholders. 

To build the MVP, we need to set up a process for content creation, packaging, and distribution.

1. Creation: For each feature or service described in the newsletter, the VSP PM(s) responsible for it will write a product guide using a template.  The newsletter will have a 2-3 sentence description taken from the product guide with links to the entire guide as well as other user-facing documentation.
2. Packaging: The content of the newsletter MVP will be assembled by the Service Design team, reviewed by the Content team, and approved by Leadership.
3. Distribution: We will use an email marketing tool like Mailchimp to distribute the newsletter.  Using the tool, we will create a web page for VFS team members and stakeholders to subscribe to the newsletter.

For the MVP, we will not include platform release notes as these will be communicated by other means.

We will track and analyze how our audience interacts with the MVP newsletter (using Mailchimp or alternative tools) to determine next steps for evolving our apporach in subsequent phases.

## KPIs

- % of recipients who open the email
- Newsletter Helpfulness rating - scale from 1 to 5

## Go-to-market Strategy

- Create a web page for subscribing to the email newsletter (using Mailchimp or alternative tools)
- Tell VFS teams how to subscribe to newsletter in Team of Teams and #vfs-all-teams

## Target Launch Date

- Target launch date for the MVP: 4/15
- Post-launch evaluaton: finish by 4/30
