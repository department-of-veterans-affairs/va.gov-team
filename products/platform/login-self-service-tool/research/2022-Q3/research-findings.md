# Research Goals

Throughout all research performed for the Self-Service Login Tool, we are seeking to:

- Understand the user response to encountering login issues
- Understand the user login process
- Gather preliminary usability information for the proposed login self-service tool

# Research Questions

- What are typical user responses to encountering a login issue?
- How frequently do users report login issues?
  - If users report issues, do they use AVA, VA411, or other means of reporting?
  - Do users use any help documentation on the [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) website, or the respective login provider websites?
- What primary pain points exist throughout the login process?

# Methodology

We utilized contextual inquiry to observe how users traverse through their standard login process. This helped identify common pain points and responses to these pain points. This also helped us to identify at what point(s) during the login process users seek assistance, if at all.

We also utilized a brief set of usability questions as an opportunity to test a preliminary clickable prototype of the self-service login tool. The goal is to observe users interacting with the prototype and using it to troubleshoot basic login issues to discern the viability of our proposed solution. This usability test will be performed in both desktop and mobile environments.

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

Through VA411 inbox responses and Medallia feedback, we hypothesize that the current login resources are insufficient when it comes to the users resolving login issues themselves. We hypothesize that most users will respond positively to a product that helps them quickly identify login problems and direct them to the appropriate resources in a timely manner.

Current data also indicates users are frustrated with the current issue reporting systems and turnaround times, namely Ask VA and the VA 411 Hotline. We hypothesize users will appreciate the efficiency of a self-service login tool, though they remain frustrated at continual login issues.

We hypothesize that the login self-service product will not be a comprehensive solution; some user demographics will likely continue to prefer talking to an agent over the phone or submitting a ticket through Ask VA.

# Key Findings

1. All participants were able to successfully use the prototype.
2. Most participants (8 out of 12) have experienced issues logging in to VA.gov.
3. Multiple participants (5 out of 12) raised concerns about the number of login services provided.
4. Multiple Participants (5 out of 12) commented that the current [Signing in to VA.gov page](https://www.va.gov/resources/signing-in-to-vagov/) is busy or has too much content.
5. Multiple participants (5 out of 12) requested additional details on specific areas of the self-service login tool, either around the purpose of the tool (3 out of 5) or clarity around specific errors (2 out of 5).

# Details of Findings

**All participants were able to successfully use the prototype.**

Nine of the participants were able to navigate the prototype without any additional guidance or questions. Three participants initially misunderstood the purpose of the tool (Detailed in finding 6 below).

Most of the participants (7 out of 12) appreciated the clarity and directness of the tool.

> *It’s clearly made so that it’s easy to understand. — P6*

> *[The prototype is] simple, uncluttered. I have enough options to solve my issues. I’m a fan of clean screens… I can find things without distraction. — P12*

**Most participants (8 out of 12) have experienced issues logging in to** [**VA.gov**](http://VA.gov)

Only roughly 25% of participants (3 out of 12) reporting not experiencing issues logging within recent memory. Most participants (8 out of 12) have experienced issues, two stating they experience issues every time. Four participants experienced issues when logging in during the study. The most common method of troubleshooting (6 out of 8) is to “try again.”

> *I usually do my best to try again for a little bit. — P4*

> *I get very frustrated. If I keep trying I do eventually get in. — P7*

**Multiple participants (5 out of 12) raised concerns about the number of login services provided.**

A common frustration for many participants was the four different login options provided. Some users were unclear as to the relationship between the four options, and if there was one in particular they should be using. This did not have a negative impact on the login experience during the studies, but it was a commonly reported frustration.

> *The main thing, why are there 4 different ways to login? It’s a little confusing. Do I have a login? Do I have a My HealtheVet login? Which one should I be using? That’s a little confusing for me. I know I said I was* [*ID.me*](http://ID.me)*, but it’s like “which one should I be using?”  — P3*

> *I’ve always wondered why we have so many ways to get in, why are there so many ways? — P7*

**Multiple participants (5 out of 12) requested additional details on specific areas of the self-service login tool, either around the purpose of the tool (3 out of 5) or clarity around specific errors (2 out of 5).**

There were a few instances (2 out of 12) where the participant was unclear as to the purpose of the self-service login tool; they understood it to be a tool to guide the user through the login process or to be a different login portal. An additional user comprehended the purpose of the tool but stated additional clarity would be appreciated.

Participants appreciated when detail around specific errors was provided and wished to see more comparable information.

> If it’s specifically for entering the system, it might be nice to have that listed. Some sort of clarification that this is about logging in. — P11

# Additional Insights

One participant searched for “login help,” “login not working” and “id.me login help,” none of which produced helpful results to address login issues. Eventually the participant was able to find a phone number through a google search by searching “email to va.gov.”

# Recommendations

- Create opportunities to create clarity while not sacrificing simplicity.
  - This could be created through either an introductory paragraph or page (such as the [gov.uk register to vote tool](https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote)).
  - Provide contextual help within the tool (again, as seen on the [gov.uk](http://gov.uk) register to vote tool, [subpage on nationality](https://www.registertovote.service.gov.uk/register-to-vote/nationality)).
  - The retention of simplicity is important, as 7 out of the 12 participants remarked the cleanness and simplicity is one of the tools strengths. But there were still 5 participants who would appreciate more clarity around specific areas (the tools purpose, and details around common errors).
- Provide multiple options for users to engage with assistance (phone, chat bot, ticket).
  - Most older demographics prefer talking on the phone, but 3 participants mentioned having positive experiences with a chatbot on other websites. Additionally, participants expressed a willingness to open up a help desk ticket with specific credential providers, such as [ID.me](http://ID.me), if necessary.

# Next Steps

We will be making enhancements to the prototype based on feedback received during these preliminary research sessions. After these changes have been implemented, an additional round of research will be conducted. Preferably we will be testing with a prototype that can be tested on AT users.

# Further research needed

Knowing this was primarily exploratory research, the Contact Center team developed a list of “how might we” questions to drive future research plans as well as potential improvements to the next iteration of the Self-Service Login Tool.

How might we…

- …further clarify the different issue types so that users can pick the issue that pertains to them?
- …help users understand the purpose of the "login wizard?"
- …anticipate potential 2FA user errors with the login services?
- …use error messages to resolve technical issues?
- …make it more clear for users as to why there are 4 different login methods?
- …associate issues/errors experienced with relevant support resources?
- …make resource material more compact and plain language for users? 
- …integrate the login with wizard with the chat bot?
- …empower users to resolve issues in ways they feel most comfortable?
- …make it easier for users to find helpdesk phone numbers?
