# Research Plan for Contact Center Login Self-Service Tool, August 2022
## Background
A large portion of VA 411 Call Center tickets and AskVA (AVA) inquiries pertain to issues logging in to VA.gov. Though there are resources available on VA.gov to assist Veterans with their login process, the primary login resource page has not historically performed well.
In most instances, the VA 411 calls and AVA inquiries are resolved via templated responses provided by the Platform Call Center team. This response process can take anywhere from 1 to 5 days, and in some cases more than 10.
The proposed login self-service tool aims to empower users to diagnose and resolve basic login issues across all login platforms themselves. These issues can include:
- Two-factor (or multi-factor) authentication
- Address or phone number change
- Forgotten password or username

A portion of the research done within this study is to gain an understanding of user expectations on where this tool can reside as well as identify user pain points during the login process. 

### Current Data
Below is data showing case volume and resource page performance.

**Case Volume**
- 25% of all VA411 calls were categorized under “unable to sign in” (March 2021—March 2022); an additional 15% were Identity Verification issues
- 28% of all Tier 2 support tickets were categorized under “unable to sign in” (March 2021—March 2022)
- 2,075 Ask VA tickets (November 2021—May 2022)

**[Login Resources Page](https://www.va.gov/resources/signing-in-to-vagov/) Performance**
- Signing to VA.gov resource page “How do you rate your experience on this page?” (April 1—April 29, 2022): 77% of submissions indicated “Bad”
- “Please rate your experience with VA.gov today” (September 17, 2021—March 31, 2022): 72% responded “Negative”
- “How did this interaction change your trust in Veteran Affairs?” (September 17, 2021—March 31, 2022): Trust decreased on 64% of submissions

### OCTO Objectives
Due to the fact that login issues negatively impact the bulk of the Veteran experience, this study touches on a bulk of the OCTO objectives.

- Veterans can manage their health services online.
- Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online.
- Logged-in users can update their personal information easily and instantly.
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features.
- Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov.

### Measures to Increase:
- Usage of digital self-service tools
- Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov

### Measures to Decrease:
- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution
- Time to successfully complete and submit online transactions

### Veteran Journey
This study touches on the following phases, life stages, and moments in the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

| Phase                                             | Life Stage            | Moment(s)                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Phase 1: Serving and Separating from the Military | Getting Out           | Engaging VA to access benefits and services                  |
| Phase 2: Living Civilian Life                     | Taking Care of Myself | Managing primary care and chronic health issues*<br>Engaging VA to access benefits and services |
| Phase 3: Retiring and Aging                       | Retiring              | Finding additional sources of income                         |

**Moment that matters, an area that may have a significant impact on Veteran's experiences*

## Research Goals
Throughout this study, we are seeking to:

- Understand the user response to encountering login issues
- Understand the user login process
- Gather preliminary usability information for the proposed login self-service tool

### Outcome
The outcomes of this study will help us
- Determine where within the login process users are most likely to access this product
- Determine if the prototype serves as a sufficient starting point for future iterations of the product
- Gain an understanding of the frequency at which users utilize preexisting issue reporting or resolution resources, and the level of successful resolution achieved through these means

After this preliminary round of testing, a more comprehensive prototype can be built. Future iterations can then be tested for accessibility. 

### Research questions
This research will help us answer:
- What are typical user responses to encountering a login issue?
- How frequently do users report login issues?
  - If users report issues, do they use AVA, VA411, or other means of reporting?
  - Do users use any help documentation on the VA.gov website, or the respective login provider websites?
- What primary pain points exist throughout the login process?

### Hypothesis
Through VA411 inbox responses and Medallia feedback, we hypothesize that the current login resources are insufficient when it comes to the users resolving login issues themselves. We hypothesize that most users will respond positively to a product that helps them quickly identify login problems and direct them to the appropriate resources in a timely manner.

Current data also indicates users are frustrated with the current issue reporting systems and turnaround times, namely Ask VA and the VA 411 Hotline. We hypothesize users will appreciate the efficiency of a self-service login tool, though they remain frustrated at continual login issues.

We hypothesize that the login self-service product will not be a comprehensive solution; some user demographics will likely continue to prefer talking to an agent over the phone or submitting a ticket through Ask VA.

## Method
We will utilize contextual inquiry to observe how users traverse through their standard login process. This will help identify common pain points and responses to these pain points. This will also help us to identify at what point(s) during the login process do users seek assistance, if at all.

We will also utilize a brief set of usability questions as an opportunity to test a preliminary clickable prototype of the self service login tool. The goal is to observe users interacting with the prototype and using it to troubleshoot basic login issues to discern the viability of our proposed solution. This usability test will be performed in both desktop and mobile environments. 

### Location
This research will be held remotely over Zoom. Users will also interact with a clickable Sketch prototype. The primary point of contact for the research will be Ian McCullough ([ian.mccullough@oddball.io](ian.mccullough@oddball.io)).

## Recruitment

### Recruitment Approach
Our intended audience for this study is Veterans who frequently log in to VA.gov. We will be recruiting participants through Perigean.

We aim to be inclusive with this study and have identified recruitment criteria to meet these needs below.

### Recruitment Criteria
We want to recruit 15 Veterans for an expected completion of 10-12 studies.

**Primary Criteria (Must-Haves)**
- Has logged in to VA.gov within the past 6 months.
- Has Login.gov, ID.me, DS Logon, or My HealtheVet credentials

**Secondary Criteria (Nice-to-Haves)**
For inclusivity, it would be nice to have:
- Eight participants from the 55-64+ age group
- Eight participants with cognitive disabilities
- Four participants from rural areas
- Four participants without a college degree
- At least 2 participants who identify as women
- At least 4 participants who identity as non-Caucasian
- At least 2 participants who use assistive technology; 

Due to tool constraints, recruit for hearing aids and magnification/zoom
