## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Ian and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about Login Self-Service Tool.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
-  This entire session should take less than an hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
-  In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
-  \[IF APPROPRIATE:\] You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
-  If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
-  Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
- If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

*Start recording.*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Screen Sharing

In order to get the most out of this session, I would like to be able to see your screen. Can you let me know what kind of device you’re using, laptop/desktop or a mobile device?

**If desktop participant**
- Talk them through Zoom screen sharing and chat features shown in the document.
- [Screen share and walk through this document if necessary](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lo44N4rTBDaHfcsjX6bCV1a--YJSTPXSXnZbywB71J0/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1657815835269805&usg=AOvVaw1wnBkR4z2OBGvKrIashc_w)

**If mobile participant**
First I want to make sure your technology is ready to go for this session. Can you confirm for me what type of device you're using to join today?

*For iPhone:*
- When you are inside the zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. Audio, Video, Share content, Participants, and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share content." Any questions?
-  Tap ‘Share content’ (Green button at bottom middle of the screen)
-  Tap on Screen
-  Tap Zoom
-  Tap start broadcast. After a count of 3, the entire device screen will be shared into the meeting
-  Tap the red bar at the top of your screen when you are ready to end the share
-  Great, now I can see your phone screen! I'm going to begin now if that's ok with you. We will return to this in a few moments. For troubleshooting screen sharing in iOS, reference the Zoom documentation here [https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005890803-iOS-Screen-Sharing](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005890803-iOS-Screen-Sharing&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1657815835271006&usg=AOvVaw3zTAQpBU9d3lKWqq4ThFrt)

*For Android:*
- When you are inside the zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. For instance, Share and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share." Any questions?
- Tap "Share"
- Tap "Screen"
- May give a "sensitive info" alert
- May ask you to give Zoom permission to display over other apps, toggle yes. Then hit the back arrow . Then it might just share your screen.
- Tap "Start now" (maybe) For Android troubleshooting, try here: [https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1657815835271896&usg=AOvVaw2BneQiM4Jxv3wof3R1BB34)

*Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*
- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- *Share your screen.* Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

## Task 1: Logging In - 10 Minutes

### What to Look For:
- What path does the user take to log in?
- What credential are they using?
