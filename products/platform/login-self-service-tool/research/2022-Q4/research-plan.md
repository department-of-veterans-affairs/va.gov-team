# Research Plan for Contact Center Login Self-Service Tool, October 2022

## Background

The Contact Center team has been working to build a tool that aims to assist VA.gov users who are experienceing issues logging in. Typical login error resolution paths include users submitting VA 411 technical support issues or AVA inquiries. However, depending on the specifics of the error, the resolution frequently resides within the credential provider, not VA.gov. The proposed Login Self-Service tool seeks to put the user in contact with the appropriate help desk early in the resolution process, thus eliminating any unnecessary steps that cost valuable time.

### OCTO Objectives

Due to the fact that login issues negatively impact the bulk of the Veteran experience, this study touches on a bulk of the OCTO objectives.

- Veterans can manage their health services online.
- Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online.
- Logged-in users can update their personal information easily and instantly.
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features.
- Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov.

### Measures to Increase:

- Usage of digital self-service tools
- Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov

### Measures to Decrease:

- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution
- Time to successfully complete and submit online transactions

### Veteran Journey

This study touches on the following phases, life stages, and moments in the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

| Phase                                             | Life Stage            | Moment(s)                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Phase 1: Serving and Separating from the Military | Getting Out           | Engaging VA to access benefits and services                  |
| Phase 2: Living Civilian Life                     | Taking Care of Myself | Managing primary care and chronic health issues* Engaging VA to access benefits and services |
| Phase 3: Retiring and Aging                       | Retiring              | Finding additional sources of income                         |

**Moment that matters, an area that may have a significant impact on Veteran's experiences*

## Research Goals

Throughout this study, we are seeking to:

- Understand the user response to encountering login issues
- Gather usability findings on a second iteration of the Login Self-Service Tool prototype

### Outcome

The outcomes of this study will help us

- Determine where within the login process users are most likely to access this product.
- Gague the viability of the Login Self-Service Tool as a tool to be built and deployed into VA.gov the production environment.
- Determine if the language and design employed within the prototype clearily indicates to the user when a resolution requires reaching out to their appropriate credential provider rather than calling the VA or submitting an AVA inquiry.

After this round of testing, a more comprehensive prototype can be built. Future iterations can then be tested for accessibility.

### Research questions

This research will help us answer:

- How might we further clarify the different issue types so that users can pick the issue that pertains to them?
- How might we associate issues/errors experienced with relevant support resources?
- How might we empower users to resolve issues in ways they feel most comfortable?

### Hypothesis

- We hypothesize that users will appreciate the visual and navigational simplicity of the Login Self-Service Tool.
- We hyptothesize that users will endorse the building and production of this tool to be accessed on the VA.gov site.
- We hypothesize that some content wihtin the tool may be superfluous, and we seek to discern what level of content is necessary. 

## Method

We will utilize contextual inquiry to observe how users traverse through their standard login process. This will help identify common pain points and responses to these pain points. This will also help us to identify at what point(s) during the login process do users seek assistance, if at all.

We will also utilize a brief set of usability questions as an opportunity to test a preliminary clickable prototype of the self service login tool. The goal is to observe users interacting with the prototype and using it to troubleshoot basic login issues to discern the viability of our proposed solution. This usability test will be performed in both desktop and mobile environments.

### Location

This research will be held remotely over Zoom. Users will also interact with a clickable Sketch prototype. The primary point of contact for the research will be Ian McCullough ([ian.mccullough@oddball.io](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/login-self-service-tool/research/2022-Q3/ian.mccullough@oddball.io)).

## Recruitment

### Recruitment Approach

Our intended audience for this study is Veterans who frequently log in to VA.gov. We will be recruiting participants through Perigean.

We aim to be inclusive with this study and have identified recruitment criteria to meet these needs below.

### Recruitment Criteria

We want to recruit 15 Veterans for an expected completion of 10-12 studies.

**Primary Criteria (Must-Haves)**

- Has logged in to VA.gov within the past 6 months.
- Has Login.gov, ID.me, DS Logon, or My HealtheVet credentials
- We would also like 5 participants to join on a mobile device.

**Secondary Criteria (Nice-to-Haves)** For inclusivity, it would be nice to have:

- Eight participants from the 55-64+ age group
- Eight participants with cognitive disabilities
- Four participants from rural areas
- Four participants without a college degree
- At least 2 participants who identify as women
- At least 4 participants who identity as non-Caucasian
- At least 2 participants who use assistive technology;

Due to tool constraints, recruit for hearing aids and magnification/zoom

## Timeline

### Preparation

A pilot session will be handled internally by the Platform Contact Center team.
