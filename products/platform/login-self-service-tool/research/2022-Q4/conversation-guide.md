## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Ian and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about Login Self-Service Tool.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
-  This entire session should take less than an hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
-  In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
-  \[IF APPROPRIATE:\] You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
-  If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
-  Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
- If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

*Start recording.*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Screen Sharing

In order to get the most out of this session, I would like to be able to see your screen. Can you let me know what kind of device you’re using, laptop/desktop or a mobile device?

**If desktop participant**
- Talk them through Zoom screen sharing and chat features shown in the document.
- [Screen share and walk through this document if necessary](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lo44N4rTBDaHfcsjX6bCV1a--YJSTPXSXnZbywB71J0/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1657815835269805&usg=AOvVaw1wnBkR4z2OBGvKrIashc_w)

**If mobile participant**
First I want to make sure your technology is ready to go for this session. Can you confirm for me what type of device you're using to join today?

*For iPhone:*
- When you are inside the zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. Audio, Video, Share content, Participants, and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share content." Any questions?
-  Tap ‘Share content’ (Green button at bottom middle of the screen)
-  Tap on Screen
-  Tap Zoom
-  Tap start broadcast. After a count of 3, the entire device screen will be shared into the meeting
-  Tap the red bar at the top of your screen when you are ready to end the share
-  Great, now I can see your phone screen! I'm going to begin now if that's ok with you. We will return to this in a few moments. For troubleshooting screen sharing in iOS, reference the Zoom documentation here [https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005890803-iOS-Screen-Sharing](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005890803-iOS-Screen-Sharing&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1657815835271006&usg=AOvVaw3zTAQpBU9d3lKWqq4ThFrt)

*For Android:*
- When you are inside the zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. For instance, Share and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share." Any questions?
- Tap "Share"
- Tap "Screen"
- May give a "sensitive info" alert
- May ask you to give Zoom permission to display over other apps, toggle yes. Then hit the back arrow . Then it might just share your screen.
- Tap "Start now" (maybe) For Android troubleshooting, try here: [https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1657815835271896&usg=AOvVaw2BneQiM4Jxv3wof3R1BB34)

*Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*
- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- *Share your screen.* Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

## Task 1: Issue Resolution - 10 Minutes

Ensure the user is still sharing their screen. Have them navigate to the VA homepage.
- If you were experiencing a problem logging in that was not resolving itself, how would you troubleshoot that problem?
- Where on the VA.gov website would you go to find resources for login problems?

**Follow up:**

- If the veteran finds the resources & support article, ask:
  - What is your initial reaction to the content on this page?
  - What is helpful?
  - What is not helpful?
  - What needs to be clarified?

## Task 2: Prototype - 15 Minutes

Share link to prototype:

- [Desktop](https://sketch.com/s/cbb5c762-39e4-47bb-af88-22e693a4cb51/a/eK2jjlW/play)

### Prototype Questions
- What questions do you have about the content on this page?
- Does anything need to be explained?
- Let’s say you just recently experienced an issue logging in to VA.gov. Can you use this tool to help troubleshoot that issue?
- What steps would you take from the information you viewed?
- Is this easier than how you would address these login issues in the past? How so?

### What to Look For:

- Did they use the definition drop down the ID.me issue choice page?

  - What are your initial reactions to the content on this page?
  - Does anything need to be explained?
  - *If they have not opened the accordion, prompt them to.*
    - Is the content within the accordion helpful?
    - Is any of the content here unnecessary?
    - Does anything need further clarification?
- *Have them navigate to "Username/Password" page through the ID.me pathway*
  - If you were to end up on this page, what would your next action be?
- *Have them navigate to "Two Factor Authentication" page through the ID.me pathway*
  - What are you initial reactions to the content on this page?
  - If you were to end up on this page, what would your next action be?
- What did you like about this prototype?
- What do you dislike?
- What would you change?
- Does anything within this product seem out of place or unnecessary to you?
- Is there anything in this process we didn’t cover today that you think we should know about?

## Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
