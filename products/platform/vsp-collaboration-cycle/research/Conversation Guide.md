**Introduction**
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Naomi from the VSP Service Design team. I’m working with Megan and Andrea on gathering feedback on the VSP Collaboration Cycle. I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Your feedback will be helpful as we work to improve the process. Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 1 hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the tools and resources that the Platform provides. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? *Start recording.*

- How has the delivery of the required artifacts gone? 
  - Does the team know what artifacts are required? 
  - Do they have enough time to create them?
  - Are there areas where the platform can help with this?

- Are there things that you do in the course of your development process that aren’t in the Collaboration Cycle that you think could help other teams?
