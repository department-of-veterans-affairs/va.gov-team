## Qualitative Feedback 

### Moderated Testing 

_Rollout meetings with VSA teams_ 

"I still feel confused on how this fits in with the VSA workflows. How does this work with how often we're meeting with Tze and Jennifer? All the processes you presented are great and well-organized and make a lot of sense, I just wish I personally had a better picture of the workflow and overall timeline with team-specific elements mixed in." 

"It seems like so many hands"

(Product Manager) "Can some of these things fall more on developers? And/or, can I put all the needed documentaiton in one place so I'm not copying it into every ticket? What is a 'how to proceed as a VFS PM' timeline?"

"I got immediate feedback from my team that they are very stoked about the new and more organized process" 

"I feel like (partially because we were working closely with Shawna) we did some of the check-ins (even though it was a bit disjointed). I am into it. I work better when there are processes in place!"
