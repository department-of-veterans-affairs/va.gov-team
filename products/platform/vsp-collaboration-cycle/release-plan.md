# VSP Collaboration Cycle - Release Plan

---

## Phase I: moderated production testing

_For moderated production testing, we will meet individually with each VSA team to explain the VSP Collaboration Cycle, determine how it applies to that team's work, gather feedack, and iron out any remaining issues._

### Planning:
- Desired date range or test duration: 2 weeks, beginning the week of 2/17/20
- Desired number of users: 8 teams; ~50 users including DEPO team members
- How you'll recruit the right production test users: all VSA teams, in collaboration with VSA leadership
- How you'll conduct the testing: meet with VSA teams individually to explain the process
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: resources will be live in `va.gov-team` repository 

### Results:
- Number of users: x
- Number of bugs identified / fixed: x/x
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum

_For unmoderated production testing, we will have ask all VSA teams to follow the VSP Collaboration Cycle._

### Planning:
- Desired date range: 2 weeks, beginning the week of 3/2/20 (time range will overlap with above as we finish conducting moderated testing with VSA teams)
- Desired number of unique users: 8 teams; ~50 users including DEPO team members
- How you'll make the product available in production while limiting the # of users who can find/access it: resources will be live in `va.gov-team` repository 
- "Success" criteria (by the numbers):
  - < 20% of collaboration point survey respondents say `I'm not sure` regarding which collaboration point they just completed _(note: we will also note the approximate percentage of respondents who answer this question incorrectly, but because the survey is anonymous we will not have accurate data)_
  - Qualitative feedback from collaboration cycle survey
