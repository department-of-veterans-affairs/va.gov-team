# Product Outline - VA.gov Experience Standards

## Overview
The VA.gov Experience Standards are a set of criteria that VFS teams are assessed against as they bring their products through the Collaboration Cycle. The criteria covers 4 practice areas that impact the Veteran experience - design, content, information artchitecture and accessibility. The standards are written to be the expected behavior of VFS team products. Each standards has a correlated issue which describes the undesirable behavior of the product. 

## Problem Statement
VFS teams are required to build products that mean VA.gov standards, however the standards have not been explicitly defined. In addition, Platform team has found it challenging to track and report out the issues they are finding in VFS products during Collaboration Cycle reviews. The VA.gov Experience Standards will be made availble to VFS teams so they know prior to their build what Platform reviewers will be evaluating their products against. The VA.gov Experience Standards also allow Platform reviewers to align and group their feedback on the issue at hand, opposed to being grouped by practice area. This will allow for easier tracking of the issues that exist on VA.gov, and can be tracked by team, product, and impacted practice areas.

## Personas
Platform Reviewer's are currently the main users of this product within the Collaboration Cycle. 

## Measuring Success

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

_Describe, in a few sentences and/or bullet points, what you plan to build, and how it will solve the problem. Some questions to think about:_

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

_For non-trivial technical solutions, an [engineering design doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/engineering/design-docs) should be written to deeply explain **How** this product will be built._
