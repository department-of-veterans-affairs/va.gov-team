## Overview
The VSP Collaboration Cycle is a process that Veteran-facing Services (VFS) teams are required to complete for all medium-to-large work initiatives, in order to ensure that they (VFS teams) deliver reliable digital services that are continuously improving and work for people.

## Problem Statement
For the first many months of VSP's existence, each practice area had its own set of "rules of engagement" (ROEs). These ROEs required VFS teams building on VA.gov to comply with distinct review processes for each practice area: design, accessibility, information architecture, content, QA, engineering, research, product. For example, the team needed to get a separate content, design, and accessibility review before user testing — following different request processes and receiving feedback in non-standardized ways. This has resulted in confusion, duplicative efforts, missed reviews, and many other pain points (some of which are captured in [VSP Service Design team's research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/platform/product-discovery/roe-documentation)). 

How might we consolidate the existing VSP reviews — _not including PR reviews_ — to present them as a unified process, and reduce the burden of coordination on VFS teams? How might we frame this review process as a collaborative, supportive relationship that embodies helpful, valuable guidance as opposed to blocking checkpoints? 
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- VFS teams understand the VSP review process and know what they need to do to adhere to it
- VFS teams see value in the services provided by VSP
- VA.gov products meet VSP standards

## Undesired User Outcomes

- VFS teams have to complete more VSP reviews than before 
- VFS teams see VSP reviews as blocking checkpoints with no real value 

## Desired Business Outcomes

- VA.gov products meet VSP standards
- Veterans have a successful experience using VA.gov
- VSP is seen as a valuable, helpful resouce for VFS teams (and ultimately for VA.gov)
- VSP can begin to better track which VFS teams are meeting VSP standards (in which practice areas and at which development stages)

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- VSP reviews are so burdensome and blocking that the rate of development on VA.gov is slowed too much
- VSP is seen as unhelpful, inflexible, and useless

## Assumptions

- We **assume** that VFS teams and their DEPO leads will follow a VSP review process if they can easily understand its requirements.
- We **assume** 

- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumtion w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

## KPIs
- *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
