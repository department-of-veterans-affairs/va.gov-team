# Collaboration Cycle Custom Tracks



## Overview
Custom Tracks is a child product of the Collaboration Cycle. Custom Tracks is a series of questions asked by VSP and answered by VFS teams at the early part of their product/feature lifecycle. The answers determine which Collaboration Cycle touchpoints are necessary for the VFS team to complete throughout their product/feature build.

On 12/17/2020, the Custom Tracks effort pivoted. The team wants to prioritize leaner paths through the Collaboration Cycle. Design Intent Collaboration meeting and the Usability Testing Prep meeting will be made optional for VFS teams. The Custom Tracks questions will now focus on identifying what artifacts the VFS team will need to produce at Staging Review, as well as continuing to determine which other Collaboration touchpoints would be necessary for the team to complete (e.g. Research Plan Review, Analytics Request, etc.). Also as part of Custom Tracks, VSP will define minimal standards that must be met by VFS teams at Staging Review. The accessibility standards are well defined, however additional standards must be defined for content, design, IA and QA (and potentially additional practice areas). 

To allow for teams to get feedback without the burden of scheduling a 2-days-in-advance meeting, Collaboration Cycle will offer Office hours once a week for VFS teams to ask questions with regards to accessibility, content, IA, design and QA (and possibly research, analytics, privacy/security, and contact center).

## Problem Statement
VSP Collaboration Cycle is a one-size-fits-all process that VFS teams are encouraged to go through as they build their Veteran-facing products for VA.gov. VFS teams have stated that small changes are difficult to move through the Collaboration Cycle, the process is burdensome, and it is challenging to know what is expected of them at the various review points, especially Staging Review.

## Personas
As a Collab Cycle team member, I want to know early information about a VFS team, so I can deduce what help they may need in meeting DEPO Standards and recommended a customized Collab Cycle path to make their experience as quick and smooth as possible.

As a VFS product manager, I want to share what I know without having to do too much hunting, so I don't give up or get too distracted from my own work.

As a VFS product manager, I want to understand how the platform is helping me, so I can trust in the process and be an active (not reticent) participant.

As a VFS product manager, I want to throughly understand what is expected of me and my team at Staging Review so that I can come prepared and not have significant rework prior to launch.


## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
VFS team has a positive experience with the Collaboration Cycle
Potentially a decrease in "Must" feedback at Staging
Correlation between teams choosing leaner paths through Collaboration Cycle and less "must" feedback at staging

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics, if possible._

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

_Describe, in a few sentences and/or bullet points, what you plan to build, and how it will solve the problem. Some questions to think about:_

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

_For non-trivial technical solutions, an [engineering design doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/engineering/design-docs) should be written to deeply explain **How** this product will be built._
