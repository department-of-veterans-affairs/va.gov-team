# Customer Support Tracking

## Overview

Currently, we don't have a good way to categorize or gather data about support requests. We started manually tracking support requests but need an automated solution to capture this data to help inform future decisions around team's capacity and roadmaps.

## Problem Statement

Without better understanding how Platform teams' time is spent on customer support requests, we don't know what areas we could focus on to make improvements that reduce the support burden on Platform teams.

If we had a standardized way to track customer support requests in Slack, we could use that data to identify roadmap initiatives that would give VFS teams the documentation and tools they need to successfully do their work on their own.

## Personas

VFS and Platform team members

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- for adoption: % of customer support requests that are automatically tracked.
- time it takes to compile customer support reports.
- % of support requests resolved by documentation (dependent on future enhancements).

------

## Assumptions

- By creating a standardized process for tracking customer support requests across Platform teams, we expect to identify “problem areas” with high burdens of manual support to be prioritized in future Platform initiatives.

## Solution Approach

### Support Bot Pilot 
- Goal is to reduce friction for VSP team members in logging support requests in the spreadsheet.
- After the spike, we will test the Slack app prototype to determine what gaps remain.
- Doing a [spike](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsp-5cedc9cce6e3335dc5a49fc4/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/12787https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsp-5cedc9cce6e3335dc5a49fc4/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/12787) VSP Engineering on a very simple Slack app for tracking support requests in collaboration.

### Slack Workflow
- Goal is to automate tracking of support request volume and make it easier to categorize support requests by topic.
