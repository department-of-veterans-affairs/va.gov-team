# Customer Support Tracking

## Overview

Currently, we don't have a good way to categorize or gather data about support requests. We've started using a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BmFJKmkJsgXaj_kebn16veLVJ5H52wlCjmbpS5JdXKo/edit#gid=769438914) to capture this data to help inform future decisions around team's capacity and roadmaps.

## Problem Statement

Without a better understanding of how Platform teams' time is spent on customer support work, it is difficult to identify areas to focus on to make improvements that reduce the support burden on Platform teams by enabling VFS teams to find answers or get unblocked on their own.

If we had a standardized way to log customer support requests and all customer-facing Platform teams logged every support request using that process, we could use that data to identify roadmap initiatives that would give VFS teams the documentation and tools they need to successfully do their work on their own.

## Who is this for?
