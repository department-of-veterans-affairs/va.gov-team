# Automated content review: Product outline

## Overview
Automated content reviews allows team members writing static and dynamic content on VA.gov to embrace self-service while adhering to content and plain language standards across the website.

## Problem Statement
VSP’s content specialist spends a non-trivial amount of time addressing “low-level” content issues. 

_How might we automate those checks to free up our content specialist to be able to provide faster support?_
 
## Personas

* VFS content editors
* VSP content reviewer(s)


## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* Utilization of automated content reviewer
* Number of remediations identified and addressed by the plain language linter
* Number of content review support requests, split by low-level errors vs high level errors

#### Baseline KPI Values
n/a

## Assumptions
- Automated content reviews will free up the VSP content reviewer from enough manual support to allow VSP to scale more seamlessly.
- Giving VFSs the tools to self serve, ie identify their own low-level content issues, will allow them to move through the Collaboration Cycle and get to producton more quickly.
- VFS content editors will be receptive to using an automated content reviewer (vs reaching out for human support).
- If we give VFSs the tools to identify their own low-level content issues, VFSs will use the tools.

## Solution Approach
To pull plain language linting through to the finish line, we will focus on two aspects: rules and enforcement (unprioritized).

* **Rules governing what the automated content reviewer identifies**: Review the preliminary set of content validation warnings ([2235](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsp-5cedc9cce6e3335dc5a49fc4/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/2235).
* **Process governing how the automated content reviewer is used**: Identify various VFS content editing workflows, and potential spots within those workflows where an automated content reviewer can be inserted.
