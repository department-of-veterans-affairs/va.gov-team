# Release Plan 


## Phase I: Typeahead POC Release

### Planning:
- Desired date range or test duration: [December 23, 2020 - January 31, 2021] 
- Desired number of users: 5% of all VA.gov users
- How you'll recruit the right production test users: Users will be selected at random
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: Feature will be available on Staging for all users. Research Sessions and testing will use the Staging environment to access the feature. 

### Results:
Findings are inconclusive due to Search.gov defect, [see details](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/8896#issuecomment-795647840). As a result we have created a hardcoded list of typeahead suggestions and established POC2 to evaluate the feature.

- Desired date range or test duration: [April 12, 2021 to (minimum April 25, 2021. Will continue as we validate data]

- How you'll recruit the right production test users: Users will be selected at random
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: Feature will be available on Staging for all users. Research Sessions and testing will use the Staging environment to access the feature. 

### Results:
- TBD (Results are currently being validated . Upon review of the data collected we discovered further exploration that is required. Working with the analytics team we have identified the implementation of domo was not as expected and we are working to resolve as of May 11. Findings will be summarized and included once available. 

## Phase III: Typeahead 1.0 Release

        - Followed by evaluation to ensure we are not hitting any rate overages
    -  Tuesday, May 18, 2021 - Increase to 65% 
        -  Followed by evaluation to ensure we are not hitting any rate overages
    -  Wednesday, May 19, 2021 - Increase to 80%

       -  Search & Discovery team will continue to monitor the rates at which we are hitting the search.gov API. If there is ANY concern that we are reaching the overage rates we will decide if rolling back to 80% is needed or if Search.gov needs to further increases our rate limits.
