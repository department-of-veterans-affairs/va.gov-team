## Phase I: Typeahead POC Release

### Planning:
- Desired date range or test duration: December 1, 2021 - January 31, 2022
- Desired number of users: 25% of all VA.gov users
- How you'll recruit the right production test users: Users will be selected at random
- How you'll conduct the testing: Online
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: Feature will be available on Staging for all users. Research Sessions and testing will use the Staging environment to access the feature.

### Results:
Findings are inconclusive due to Search.gov defect, [see details](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/8896#issuecomment-795647840). As a result we have created a hardcoded list of typeahead suggestions and established POC2 to evaluate the feature.

## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
