View the [research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/user-roles/discovery/sme-interviews/user-roles-sme-research-plan.md).

## Research Goals

1. Understand the unique definitions and nuances each administration has for non-Veterans.

2. Define tasks each non-Veteran user type may need to complete for each administration.

## Research Methodology

We conducted 30 minute semi-structured interviews over Zoom.

### Who we talked to

We spoke to subject matter experts (SMEs) at the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) and Veterans Benefits Administration; a specific list of individuals and areas of expertise is available [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/user-roles/discovery/sme-interviews/README.md).  

We initially planned to learn about NCA user roles as well, but decided to hold off for now since NCA does not have digital products that intersect with VA.gov.

### Research Questions

1. What non-Veteran user roles does each administration serve?
2. What qualifies a person as a dependent or a beneficiary? How are those roles different?
3. What is the difference between POAs, CVSOs, VSOs, and claim agents, according to each administration?
4. What qualifies a person as a caregiver?
5. What are the tasks that each user type may need to do?

## Key Findings

*Will fill this out once details are complete.*

## Finding Details

1. **Dependents** are people who have a legal relationship with the Veteran, and are financially dependent on the Veteran. 

   - VHA and VBA recognize spouses, minor children, and helpless adult children as dependents.
   - VBA also recognizes parents as dependents; VHA does not.
   - Dependents can also be the direct recipient of a benefit or service, such as an education benefit, and/or they could be a Veteran's caregiver. 
   - For VHA, MPI identifies someone as a dependent with the `PERSON_TYPE: DEP` attribute.
   - When a dependent's **only connection** to the VA is their dependent status, they wouldn't have a need to see information related to their Veteran (since the Veteran is the recipient of any benefits where the dependent is claimed), and they wouldn't have any benefits of their own to manage. 

   **Outstanding questions**

   - Confirm VBA dependents will be known in MPI
   - Confirm dependent info is stored in MPI under the `person type` attribute.

2. According to VHA and VBA, **beneficiaries** are anyone who is the direct recipient of a benefit or service from VA.

   - This could be a Veteran, or a qualifying family member.
   - Each benefit has specific qualifications to determine beneficiary eligibility. 
   - Once a person is actively receiving a benefit, the tasks they would need to do on VA.gov are the same regardless of if they are a Veteran or a non-Veteran. For example, a non-Veteran beneficiary receiving education benefits should be able to update their direct deposit information or view payment history the same way a Veteran would.
   - **Outstanding questions**

   - Confirm this is true for VHA
   - Confirm VBA beneficiaries will be known in MPI
   - If MPI has `person type` attributes already for VHA why can't VBA tap into that?
   - What is the `person_type` for a non-Veteran beneficiary?

3. The **caregiver** role has different definitions between VHA and VBA; in both cases, the caregiver's goal is to reduce the burden on the Veteran and help them receive and manage the benefits they've earned from VA.

   VHA officially recognizes caregivers through the VA Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers Program. There is [specific criteria for this program clearly defined on VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/family-member-benefits/comprehensive-assistance-for-family-caregivers/), which includes the fact that the Veteran must be enrolled in VA healthcare, and have a service-connected illness, injury, or disability. There isn't a VBA equivalent for this program. Caregivers in this program would also be considered VA beneficiaries since they receive benefits and services from the VA, so they would have a need to access information about themselves **and their Veteran**. 

   A Veteran may need a caregiver even if they don't have a service-connected illness, injury, or disability. For example, a Veteran living with Alzheimer's disease needs full-time care. This type of caregiver would be a self-identified caregiver. Currently, a self-identified caregiver could act on behalf of a Veteran though existing VA processes:

   - The VA Online Health Delegate program (see finding 4) would give a caregiver access to some Veteran health tasks.
   - A caregiver could apply to be a Veteran's fiduciary to manage financial tasks.

   A Veteran would benefit from their caregiver - VA recognized or not - being able to do things on VA.gov on their behalf in the same way the Veteran would they were able to care for themselves. Examples include:

   - Managing financial information
   - Claims-related tasks, such as checking the status of a claim, or uploading any requested documentation.
   - Health-care related tasks such as communicating with a provider or refilling prescriptions. This can currently be done  through the health delegate program)

   **Outstanding questions**

   - How about nursing homes and other professional caregivers?
   - How would a self-identified caregiver help a Veteran with non-Health care tasks (filing an appeal) 
   - Is a Veteran ever managing things for themselves when they have a caregiver?
   - What is a difference between a caregiver and a delegate? Where are the areas of overlap and where are the areas of difference?
     - Does a caregiver automatically have delegate access? Why not?

4. A **delegate** role exists in VHA to refer to people who have been assigned delegate authority per the request of a Veteran through the VA health delegation program.

   Delegates are able to directly access some Veteran health information, such as upcoming appointments and prescription information, in MHV and participating VA Mobile Apps.  They have their own login credential through ID.me. Two access levels and related tasks were defined in [finding 3.4 from the first phase of our research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/user-roles/discovery/non-veteran-user-roles-discovery-phase-1.md#3-learn-what-roles-exist-for-my-healthevet-mhv).  From a data perspective, the VA knows a person is a delegate based on information from the Identity and Access Management (IAM) program office, and the Master Person Index (MPI).

   A VA recognized Caregiver and a Delegate would likely need to be two different types of access on VA.gov since a VA recognized Caregiver is also a beneficiary that would need to see information about their own benefits.

5. VBA and VHA definitions of **VSO representatives, claim agents, attorneys, and fiduciaries** are consistent. 

   VSO representatives, claim agents and attorneys are accredited individuals who assist Veterans and their families with claims.

   -  They're vetted through a [VA accreditation process](https://benefits.va.gov/vso/index.asp), managed by the Office of General Counsel (OGC). 
   -  VSO representatives also help Veterans and their families understand and apply for non-claim related benefits.

   -  VA-accredited attorneys and claims agents perform most of their representation after VA has issued an initial decision on a claimantâ€™s claim.

   VBA has a Fiduciary Program that assigns a Veteran a fiduciary if they have been deemed unable to manage their financial affairs.  A Veteran can also select their own fiduciary, but they need to be approved by the VA.  The fiduciary would manage benefit related payments on behalf of the Veteran. It is possible that a fiduciary would be assigned to a non-Veteran beneficiary who is receiving payments from the VA.

   Through the course of our conversations, it became clear that there are already systems in place for these user types to access relevant Veteran data and complete tasks to help the Veteran. For the purposes of this research, we can think of these users as Veteran advocates - people who are doing work on behalf of Veterans. 

   Once we get into task definition, the existing systems (outlined below) can help us better understand tasks for these users and get a sense of how we might meet their needs on VA.gov.

   - **Stakeholder Enterprise Portal (SEP)** is a VA system designed to serve VSOs, claim agents, and attorneys
   - **Digits to Digits (D2D)** is an external electronic claims transmission service between certain partners and VA. VSOs, claim agents, and attorneys can use this to access Veteran data. The SMEs we spoke to have heard they prefer this system to SEP.

   - **VBMS FID** is a VA system that was recently expanded to meet the needs of fiduciaries.

6. There are also 3rd-party organizations that receive payments from VBA, such as funeral homes, state cemeteries and nursing homes. 

   Possible use cases for these users would be to see payment history and status, as well as file claims for reimbursement. Burial claims can already be submitted electronically through eBenefits, so it would be worthwhile to look into how this is handled as we migrate functionality to VA.gov.

   **Outstanding questions for VBA**

   - What systems are these payments made through?
   - How does a nursing home who has multiple Veteran residents receive payments? Are those payments recurring? What is the overlap with VHA and health benefits?

7. **A person can have multiple connections to the VA.** As we start to think about non-Veteran roles, it's important to recognize that there can be overlap between any of the aforementioned roles. We'll need to consider how a person will be able to switch between roles with one login. Some examples are:

   - A Veteran who is a caregiver for their Veteran spouse, and is a fiduciary for their Veteran sibling.
   - A delegate who is also a beneficiary because they're receiving surviving spouse benefits.

8. We learned about high priority non-Veteran use cases by business line. Each business line had a specific use case, but all fall under the broader beneficiary category:

   - MHV prioritizes the VA patient needs above all else, whether that patient is a Veteran or non-Veteran (non-Veteran VA patients are uncommon, but do exist). 
   - VBA Pension and OBI stated that providing survivors access to their benefit information
   - VBA Compensation - Chapter 35 beneficiaries
   - From the Caregiver perspective, 2



## Recommendations

1. We should explore 3 primary non-Veteran user roles for VA.gov: dependents, beneficiaries (people who are direct recipients of VA benefits or services), and Veteran advocates (people who do work on behalf of the veterans - caregivers, VSO representatives, claim agents, attorneys, and fiduciaries)

    

- More research

Since non-Veteran beneficiaries are only eligible for certain benefits, we should provide guardrails to help prevent them from submitting applications for benefits they could never receive. For example, a non-Veteran spouse beneficiary should not be able to submit a claim for disability compensation, but they should be able to file a claim for VA Dependency and Indemnity Compensation.
