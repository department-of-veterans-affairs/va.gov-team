# Overview

Currently on staging.va.gov, the non-whitelabeled ID.me identity proofing flow appears for all logged in users. Instead, the whitelabeled flow should appear for any user who has logged in using DS Logon of MHV.

From Tanel, the full set of context values are as follows:

* dslogon - Logged in with DS Logon (LOA1 or LOA3)
* dslogon_loa3 - Logged in with DS Logon and added identity verfication with id.me
* dslogon_multifactor - Logged in with DS Logon and added 2-factor authentication with id.me

* myhealthevet - Logged in with MyHealtheVet (LOA1 or LOA3)
* myhealthevet_loa3 - Logged in with MyHealtheVet basic and added verfication with id.me
* myhealthevet_multifactor  Logged in with DS Logon and added 2-factor authentication with id.me

* http://idmanagement.gov/ns/assurance/loa/1/vets - Logged in with an LOA1 id.me account
* http://idmanagement.gov/ns/assurance/loa/3/vets -  Logged in with an LOA3 id.me account
* multifactor - Logged in with id.me accountand added 2-factor authentication with id.me


# General Expected Behavior
Essentially, if any user has logged in to VA.gov with a DS Logon or MHV credential, attempting to identity proof should show the whitelabeled flow that includes the whitelabeled VA header image (which does not include the ID.me logo).

The following are the expected screens for the differnet scenarios:

# User Stories

The following details user stories for various user types, the action taken by the user, and the expected behavior.

Note: staging.va.gov is currently pointing to MHV's INTB instance; this will be updated when it points to MHV's SYST instance.
