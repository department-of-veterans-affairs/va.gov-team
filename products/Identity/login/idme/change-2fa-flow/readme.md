# Security Notes
- For users who have already gone through LOA3 proofing, the information on the form that is shown above is cross-referenced against their verified LOA3 identity records and attributes.
- For users who have not gone through LOA3 proofing, info submitted via that form is checked against authoritative/credit sources.

In both cases, uses first successfully sign in via their 1st factor. this feature is available for them to invoke when they get to their second factor sign-in.
