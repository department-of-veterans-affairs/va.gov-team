#### Redesigned Sign In modal
This is the redesigned version of the Sign In modal. The plan is to implement this new modal as an experiment. Our hypothesis is that the new, minimal design will increase Sign In / Create Account conversions.

## Contextual messages/CTAs: Health tools 
Contextual messages/CTAs appear on the health tool pages to prompt users to sign in, create an account, verify their identity, and create/upgrade their My HealtheVet account so that they can access health tools on My HealtheVet from VA.gov. The contextual messages/CTAs also include error messages. (These are closely related to the My Health link pages.)

## My Health link pages
When users are signed in to VA.gov, they have access to the My Health link in the header. Clicking this link navigate them to My HealtheVet as a signed in user. There are various path that a user may encounter depending on their level of access, which is captured in this flow.

## Contextual messages/CTAs: Non-health tools 
Contextual messages/CTAs appear on some non-health tool pages to prompt users to sign in, create an account, or verifiy their identity so that they can check their GI benefits, apply for disability benefits, view claims and appeals, get a VA benefit letter, or apply for a Veteran ID card.
