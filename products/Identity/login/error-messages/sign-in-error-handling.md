## Error Prevalence 
[This code](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/lib/saml/response.rb#L5) and [this code](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/app/services/sso_service.rb#L10) logs our sign-in errors into Sentry so that we can view the prevalence at the following Sentry links:

## 001 Authorization of VA.gov is denied

#### Reason this error appears:
* After the identity verification process is successfully completed, the [Authorize VA screen](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/login/error-messages/alerts/01-authorize-va-screen.png) displays and the user clicks **Deny** instead of **Allow**. 
* If the user denies authorization and signs in again later, the [Authorize VA  screen](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/login/error-messages/alerts/01-authorize-va-sign-in-screen.png) displays again. If they choose **Deny**, they will see the error again.

#### How to resolve: 
The user can sign in and click **Allow** on the [Authorize VA  screen](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/login/error-messages/alerts/01-authorize-va-sign-in-screen.png).

## 002 Expired SAML response while user logged in

### Reason this error appears:
The identity provider (id.me) creates a SAML Response that gets returned to the browser and passed along to our API to log them in. The SAML Response has a "not_on_or_after" time that behaves like an expiration time.  After that time, the response is no longer valid.  This is to prevent people from re-using the response to log in again. This error has increased significantly since full-screen login was enabled.  
This is believed to be happening two ways:
  - Log in, wait >5 minutes and hit the back button on the browser. That will reset your session and try to use the expired SAML Response.  
  - Having multiple tabs open, which had been signed in but now have an expired SAML response

### How to resolve: 
We've got a three part resolution outlined. There is nothing the user needs to do to resolve this, so we'll handle it for them in code.



## 003 VAgov API server time is behind IDme server time

### Reason this error appears:
We haven't actually seen this error happen, but it could if our API server's time is behind id.me's server time.

### How to resolve: 
The user can try again, hoping to reach a different server. If it does happen, we'll get a ping in sentry to fix as well.

## 004 'We can't match your information with Veteran records’

### Reason this error appears:
* A Premium My HealtheVet or DS Logon Account is missing baseline attributes (Name, DOB, SSN)

### How to resolve: 
* If a Premium My HealtheVet or DS Logon account is missing baseline attributes, the user can
   * submit a help request via an online form
   * try to sign in using an ID.me account

### Front End Error Message

### 005 Expired SAML response while user logged out

### Reason this error appears:
The identity provider (id.me) creates a SAML Response that gets returned to the browser and passed along to our API to log them in. The SAML Response has a "not_on_or_after" time that behaves like an expiration time.  After that time, the response is no longer valid.  This is to prevent people from re-using the response to log in again. This error has increased significantly since full-screen login was enabled.  
This is believed to be happening two ways:
  - Log in, wait >5 minutes and hit the back button on the browser. That will reset your session and try to use the expired SAML Response.  
  - Having multiple tabs open, which had been signed in but now have an expired SAML response

### How to resolve: 
We've got a three part resolution outlined. There is nothing the user needs to do to resolve this, so we'll handle it for them in code.

## 006 Placeholder not mapped to any specific error message


## 007 Generic something went wrong message

### Reason this error appears:
- The saml response is invalid for a reason other than the specific reasons mapped above. Additionally, the same message is shown if there is an error and no code is set. 
- After the backend processes a successful or failed login, we redirect the user to `/callback`. When the user arrives on the page, we then try to retrieve the user profile/session data by making an API call to `/user`. If for some reason fetching the profile data fails, the user will be shown the default "We’re sorry. Something went wrong on our end." error.

### How the user can resolve
To our knowledge, the user can't and just needs to try again. We're working on providing better information to through a revised help request form so that we can get better visibility on anything that needs to be extracted out here into a separate, more helpful message
