# Historical Discovery Documents

This folder contains historical documents about the pre-discovery and discovery around identity management, LOA, and login for Vets.gov.

Where possible, dates have been added to document names to attempt to place the notes in a historical timeline; GitHub history can't be used in most cases because these items have moved around a lot and become detached from their history.
