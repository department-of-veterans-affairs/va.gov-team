# Vets.gov Identity Management Plan

## ID.me Fun Facts  

1. ID.me has 2 million existing verified Veteran users, and is incorporated with over 400 partners to offer these verified Veterans discounts without having to disclose any personal information (such as their DD-214) to these third parties.
1. ID.me can currently verify Veteran status in a number of ways.
1. A pilot partnership with the U.S. Postal Service means some Veterans can upgrade their accounts to LOA3 by having their local postal worker come to their front door. This would be a significant advantage for rural or homebound Veterans.
1. A pilot partnership with the U.S. Postal Service and the UPS store means some Veterans can upgrade their accounts by visiting their local post office or UPS store. 
1. Users can upload a photo of their passport/driver’s license to verify identity in lieu of an in-person visit.
1. Some users can verify their identity using the SIM cards in their mobile phones.

## Questions

1. How do we track LOA3 usage? (We have a finite budget for this.) 
1. If a user has an existing LOA3 account, do we also pay per user for them?
1. Under what circumstances does an LOA3 upgrade expire?
1. How does the post office/UPS store work?
