Hi all - following up on digital identity resources, I've included a list below that we believe will be helpful, particularly around government and identity.  Please let me know if you have any questions!

    - What is SAML and how it works Since SAML is an open standard, you do not face vendor locking when using it for SSO. Simply put, with SAML, a user can login to one system in an environment, and then will be able access to other systems in that environment without needing to login again (until the web browser session is ended).
