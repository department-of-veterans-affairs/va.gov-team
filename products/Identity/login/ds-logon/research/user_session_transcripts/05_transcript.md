**M: Alright [name] I’ve started recording. I’d like to confirm — are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

P: Yes.

**M: Great. So let’s go ahead and dive in with some warm-up questions. So what VA websites or application do you access online?** 

P: Uh, I used the DS login to essentially just look at my VA benefits, uh. I use it to see what I have for my GI Bill, and any disability applications or tracking. So those are the two main things I use it for. Um, I tried using it one time to book an appointment at a VA clinic, uh, but I kind of found it a little clunky. You know, this is past DS Login, but navigating to get to the point where I can book an appointment was kind of difficult.

**M: Gotcha. And so you mentioned you use DS Logon, is that the only login account that you use to access your VA benefits or websites?**

P: Yes.

**M: Great. And are there any VA services or benefits that you aren’t able  to access online?**

P: Um...none that I know of, to be honest with you. I can’t really think of any...um, yeah.

**M: Great. I’m wondering, do you remember how you set up your login accounts? Could you walk me through that process?**

*[01:50]* P: Yeah, I actually set it up a long time ago. Uh, so before I ETS(?) in 2013. My boss at the time told me to use my CAC card to set up. Well, I had an account, then he told me to use my CAC card to set-up the...I think it’s called the premium account? Or just whatever level above it. Essentially it was authenticated. I did that and I’ve been using that ever since.  I used that one for everything for a few years.

**M: Gotcha. And when you set up your DS Logon, can you walk me through...you used your CAC card for that? And did you have to do, you know, any type of  identify verification for that process?**

P: Yeah, yeah. So initially when you set up the regular login, if I remember correctly, because you know, it’s been awhile. It just asks you for some PII — your social security number and your name, I think that was it. I mean, basically any other kind of information. So I think I just had to go into the settings at the time and was logging in through my CAC card. So essentially using a DoD system to login in and verify that it was in fact me. To get the elevated access that was offered. It was kind of straightforward. It wasn’t particularly hard. I consider myself...well, right now I work as an IT consultant, so I think I’m relatively tech-savvy. So I didn’t find it particularly difficult. But I can also see how somebody could find it difficult to navigate that. 

**M: Yeah, makes sense. And when you were an active duty servicemember, what sort of online accounts did you have then?**

P: Um, with the VA?

**M: Mhm.**

P: The only thing I had, actually the only thing I really kept track of, was my GI Bill. Uh. So I don’t remember if that was a separate thing back then. But that was the only thing I ever used it for. It was just kind of for, to move over from...when I joined, I was on the Montgomery GI Bill. And I used the online system to transfer it over to Post-9/11. I didn’t use it for much else.

**M: Great. I’m wondering, would you be comfortable, uh, if we did some screensharing and you kind of walked us through some of the websites you login with DS Logon?**

P: Sure.

**M: Great. And we can do this a couple different ways so if you’re comfortable screen sharing on your computer, there’s a share button at the bottom of the Zoom application. And if you’re not comfortable doing that, we can uh, do another work around on my end.**

*[05:00]* P: I can do it. Can you see my screen?

**M: I can. It’s a beautiful background.**

P: It’s a Google plugin. Okay, so let’s see. I don’t do this the best way, probably. I kind of just go through here. And I use...I think it’s the authenticator app.

**M: And with DS Logon, you’re able to use an authenticator app?**

P: Sorry? Say it again?

**M: With DS Logon, you’re able to use an authenticator app?**

P: Yeah, pretty sure. [inaudible] Ah, there it is. 6-digits here. You know, I don’t remember what the deal is, why I don’t just use VA.gov. I don’t know, I guess I’m just a little lazy with that. I do want to give you guys some feedback here. And I know this is like tangentially-related. I tried signing in, at one point, using ID.me. It was just kind of difficult. I never managed to figure out how to do it, for whatever reason. I don’t know if that’s because it crashed.

**M: Tell me a little more about what you found difficult, there.**

P: I don’t remember, I think I was unsuccessful doing it. I got a little confused. Cause the amount...oh sorry, I keep going back and forth. Cause this right here, these three. Um, it all says, you know, just finding DS Logon. I think at one point, I got confused between the DS Logon and the ID.me and I wasn’t sure which was which. Maybe it would be helpful to just say use this if you have this, use this if you have this. I really don’t know but I tried creating it...Yeah, right now, I think it works. Let me see if it works. Cause when I’m looking here at my authenticator code, it says ID.me. I think that’s what confused me initially. Yeah, I guess I can use both now. But funny that at the time, it didn’t work. At least now I know.

**M: Yeah, so at the time, you had thought you were trying to login with one type of account and it seems like you logged in with another unknowingly?**

P: Yeah, I remember it showing me a different screen, but it looks like it works just fine now. I guess

**M: Yeah. Is there a reason that you know, is there an instance where you would want to use one of those accounts versus another account or only have one account?**

P: Right now to me it seems that they’re all pretty much the same. But I don’t see a reason why, I don’t think there’d be reason for me to use one over another. It doesn’t seem there’s a difference. Is there supposed to be a difference between the two?

**M: Yeah, I wouldn’t be able to tell you from the technical background, but I know they’re slightly different solutions. But yeah, I suppose I’m more curious — from your perspective, is there something about one or the other that would make you decide to use that account or set-up that account?**

*[09:54]* P: Uh, let me try. Uh, honestly, in terms of this one over the other, I think I’d just use this [ID.me]. Cause it seems a little more straightforward, cause I can just sign in and use my authenticator app. Versus DS Logon which seems a little more...seems a little more archaic. Cause I get this page, I get all this extra stuff. [inaudible] Looking at it now, it seems that ID.me is just a little tiny bit more straightforward. But if there’s a difference in access for different things, I’m not sure what it is. And...maybe that’s something that I could probably learn a little more about.

**M: Yeah. And I’m wondering if, you know, you’ve mentioned you had a little bit of trouble the first time you did ID.me. I’m wondering — have you had any instances when you weren’t able to login using DS Logon or experienced any kind of trouble there?**

P: No, I don’t think I ever have [had trouble] with DS Logon. Other than some maintenance here, maintenance stuff. I do have...this is probably not related to log on particularly, but I do, I think navigating can be a little challenging. Like once the logon is complete, I usually, it takes me kind of a minute if not longer to find...let’s say I’m trying to take a look at my disability rating. After I get to the landing page here. There’s no direct place if for example i’m just trying to find the disability rating I just have to kind of go through a convoluted process of getting my VA medical records. Something I remember seeing previously I could go somewhere and see my disability rating on the left hand side. I’m not sure where that is anymore.

**M: So you mentioned, um, that you use accounts to track you know like your benefits and claims and stuff. Do you do all of that through VA.gov or do you go to any other websites?**

P: I just use VA.gov. I just click here and follow the prompts, whatever it is. That’s how I’ve done both of them [talking about filing a claim]. I didn’t really file a claim until just last year and I’ve been out for 6 years. And I think the relative ease of doing it online is something that prompted it. Cause before, I remember looking at it when I just got out, cause I heard people say “file for disability as soon as you get out.” I just looked at it and it just seemed so involved, I kind of got overwhelmed and never looked at it after that. After looking at it this past year, it’s a lot more straightforward I would say. So I just use VA.gov for that.

**M: Great. Now, I saw with both of your accounts, you had set up the authenticator app and I’m wondering could talk me through why you chose to do that?**

P: Sorry, say again?

**M: I noticed with both of your accounts, with ID.me and with DS Logon, that you had put in your authenticator app. And I’m wondering if you could talk to me about how you set that up and what you think of that?**

P: Sorry, I think you’re coming in and out through my connection. Can you hear me?

**M: I can hear you, sorry about that. Are you able to hear me now?**

P: Yeah, I’m at my school, I’m using my school’s wifi. I think it’s a little weak. Um, I’m sorry, can you repeat the question one more time? I apologize.

**M: Yeah, no worries. Not a problem. So I noticed you have an authenticator app set up for both of your accounts. And I’m wondering if you could talk me through why you chose to do that and what that process was like?**

P: Uh, so I chose this for security purposes. You know, honestly, I’ve used the same laptop about 6 years too. Um, and you know, it’s a better safe than sorry thing...I need a password and just in case there’s some sort of breach. So I prefer to just have the authenticator. The authenticator app is relatively easy to do. Um, let me see if I remember how to do it. Cause I actually had to reset it recently. I think it was under account or profile...oh yeah. Shit. I don’t remember how I did it. I think I did it straight from here, now that I think about it. At that point in time...oh sorry, I forgot I’m not sharing my screen with you.

**M: Yeah, I was just going to mention if you’re walking through things, we aren’t able to see yet. Perfect.**

*[15:50]* P: Okay, so, sign in...and I’ll just use this again. Um. Hm. Okay. Oh yeah, okay. That’s why you see two of these here. It used to be just one. Cause I had to reset my phone. Um. I think uh, I just went through here in my settings. Let me just run through the 2 factor authentication stuff. Honestly, I can’t, I don’t remember how I initially set it up though. It’s uh...my, I would venture to say that I think I was prompted for it. Cause at the time, actually VA.gov was the first place I set up 2 factor authentication. In VA. So I think I was prompted for it.

**M: Gotcha. But you mentioned security is kind of what you’re getting out of this, having an authenticator code and such. Could you talk to me a little bit more about the level of trust with DS Logon, ID.me and the kind of security you’re able to put in place for those accounts?**

P: Uh, I would say it’s relatively high level trust. Uh, I don't, I mean considering all the security breaches that have been happening...it’s nice to be able to have the 2FA just in case you know someone considering, I’ve also been I was involved in an OPM breach. I’m sure someone, somewhere has all my information. Uh, so adding that second level of security, one that’s between my own hands because I’m the one that has access. At least in theory. To the code when I login, you know, that just makes me feel a little better. Does that make sense?

**M: Yeah, absolutely. Gret, well, we’re getting towards the end of some of our questions. So, I just want to give you the opportunity to, you know, share any of the other websites you use. But it sounds like you’re only using VA.gov. Is that correct?**

P: Yeah, that’s correct.

**M: Great. Awesome, so just a couple of last questions for you. Really appreciate you taking the time out today. This one’s a little bit fun, so feel free to get a little creative with this one. So if I were able to give you a magic wand and you could change something about, you know, this process of getting a VA account or logging in, what would it be?**

P: Logging in...uh...no, I think it would be pretty cool to just [audible] it’s kind of like facial recognition so you’re just able to login. You know, kind of like the iPhone does now and the Samsung phone does. Cause I think it would make it a lot easier. So instead of...alright, let me go back here. Let me just go to VA.go. So if I click sign in...uh, not that we need more options here. But, you know, if there was just more that says “login with face ID” or whatever. You just click it and then you don’t need to put in a password. Just use your webcam to just like scan your face or your fingerprint, some sort of biometric. And just avoid all the extra things and steps in between. That would be nice, I think. 

**M: Yeah, tell me a little bit more about why you think that would be nice.**

P: Well, uh, in theory it would just be probably more secure. I think, I’m not sure, but seems to me it would be a little more secure, that you’re the person behind the computer. Versus a password or say just 2FA.

*[20:54]* **M: Yeah, that makes sense. Now [name], is there anything we haven’t talked about today that you think I should know?**

P: Um. No, I don’t think you should know about it...I did, I don’t know, this is probably beyond this. I don’t know if this is something maybe the VA could use also like the 2 factor authentication and all that. If...if the VA could have a VA version of this. Of the CAC card. To be able to login to stuff. I think maybe that could make sense. I’m not sure but uh, since we have this over here...it’s, if you’re actually active duty, maybe something for Veterans would also be helpful. Um, that they could elsewhere. If we’re not talking the biometrics.

**M: Yeah, when you say use elsewhere, do you mean on other websites or—**

P: Yeah, other websites. Obviously VA.gov. Uh, you could use it when you go to VA also. Um. You know, that kind of thing.

**M: Yeah I’m curious what, um, what sort of benefits that would give you? You know,that you make you think that is something that is attractive for you?**

P: Uh, I think it was just...I think essentially whenever using some sort of VA system, I think it would make authenticating who you are as a person...it would just add another physical layer of security that you probably wouldn’t have if uh, if you just have like a VA ID. Like um...think about when you go to the bank, you can swipe your credit card. Or you can also put in your credit card into the machine and put your pin in. So it would be kinda like an added physical layer of security instead of...let’s say I lose my VA ID. Someone who maybe looks like me can go in and fake that they’re me and try to get benefits. Of some sort. I don’t know if they can, but...this is just my extra paranoid self talking.

**M: no, that all makes sense to me. I can see how, especially if you’ve been involved in data bareachs or any sort of hacks, how those multiple layers of protection are reassuring and useful in providin that kind of security. So it makes perfect sense. Awesome, so that was —**

P: Yeah I think it’s just a little helpful. Go ahead.

**M: No, no, please.**

P: Oh yeah, I was saying it’s just a little helpful right now. I think anything, considering the amount of people that were at least active duty at the time. When the breach happened. I think that these extra layers of security would be helpful for us. Cause, you know. Like just the other day, I kept getting calls from this random number saying that my Apple ID was breached, for example. Obviously I knew it was a spam call but you know, other people might not. So this is kinda the same thing. You just need to make sure you have extra security these days because you never know how or what the next scam is going to be about.

**M: Yeah, that makes sense. So that was, that’s it for the questions I have for you today. Do you have any questions for me?**

*[25:00]* P: Um, let me think here for a little bit. So, yeah. This section, was this conversation just about DS logon? Was that correct?

**M: Yeah so that was our focus for today, to understand, you know, how you use DS Logon and what that process is like for you.**

P: Yeah. Okay. That was just it, cause It seemed a little like narrow in scope and I’m just trying to understand. But actually, you know, what I’m looking at over here. I think it was as straightforward as using this, when I upgraded to a Premium account. When I did it, I don’t think the UI looked as nice at the time. Um, but it wasn’t particularly difficult, if I remember correctly, when I got my premium account.

**M: Yeah, what caused you to upgrade to your premium account?**

P: I was just, at the time, I was told I would be able to access more things online uh, if I updated to the premium account. So right now, I’m a 31 year old. I tend to prefer to do things that make sense I prefer to do them online. So for example, I really like the feature right now where you can just go in and print your disability rating as proof. Uh, in fact I’ve used it several times. And that was kind of the intent behind upgrading to a premium account. I could access more things online and take care of more things online. Uh especially because you know for example right now the closest VA to me is an hour away. It’s just a VA hospital, not a VA clinic. So just being able to do stuff that would make it necessary to go the VA is kind of nice. Yeah, so. At the time, I didn’t know what the specifics were, that I could do online. But if I could do it, then why not? It took me an extra, like 5 minutes to upgrade to a premium account and that was it.

**M: Great. Well, any other final thoughts before we wrap up today?**

P: No, that’s it. Did I answer all your questions? Cause I know you said it was 45 minutes.

**M: Yeah, no, that was perfect. Some people talk faster, some people talk slower. But we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today.**

P: No worries. I’m more than happy to.

**M: Yeah and just lastly, if you know any Veterans, caregivers or servicemembers who might be willing to participate in something like what we did today in a future research session, just let me know and I can pass on any information you can share with them.**

P: Okay, I have a friend here who just ETSed not too long ago. He was a captain for 10 years, so maybe he has some thoughts as well. I'll let him know.

**M: Great, thank you so much again. Enjoy the rest of your day and thank you again for your service.**
