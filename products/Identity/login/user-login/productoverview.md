# Problem Overview
Veterans need a better experience when logging in and identity proofing.  

Today: The current setup would not work on VA.gov which will launch in November.  We need for the login experience to be easier to use and clearer to undestand.  ID.me should not be part of the flow if the user selects DS Logon or MHV. 

## Proposed Solution

- Improve content and design

- Additional clarity on the process and steps 

- Improve order and flow when possible 

- Usability testing on flow

- Using data to identity where to reduce options provided if they aren't being used 


## Longer-term scenario is:

- Call ID.me API's to control the end-to-end experience including error messages, contact center experience and id.me wallet.  (additional ticket info here: #9435). 

## MVP will include
- Improved analytics on flow
- White labeled version for DS Logon and MHV
