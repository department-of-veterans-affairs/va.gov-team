## Frequently Asked Questions

To register with Va.gov online, you only need an email address. Additional security is needed to use advanced features of the website (like refilling a VA prescription). To access those, you’ll need to take extra steps to verify your identity.  Register for Va.gov now. 


#### Why do I need to verify my identity for Va.gov?
You need to verify your identity in order to protect your personal and health-related information. 

With your Va.gov account you can use your mobile phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop to:  
- Check the status of a disability or pension claim 
- Refill VA prescriptions 
- Send a secure message to members of your health care team

Because this type of information is personal and private, we work with our partners to ensure Veterans are able to achieve the highest level of security assurance that meets current industry standards for protecting data. This keeps your private information private by confirming that you are you — and not someone pretending to be you.

#### How do I verify my identity?
Va.gov confirms your identity using ID.me, which is a third-party Veteran-owned business that has partnered with VA to provide the strongest possible identity verification services that prevent fraud and identity theft.  At this time, no government solution can provide this level of security, so a third-party product is required.

To go through the ID.me identity proofing process, you’ll need a smartphone and a driver’s license or passport.  

If you don’t have a smartphone, you can still confirm your identity using ID.me. To do so, you’ll need access to a computer with an internet connection and a landline or mobile phone.

#### What if I can’t verify my identity online?
If you’re still unable to verify your identity through ID.me, please call the Va.gov Help Desk at 1-855-574-7286 (TTY: 1-800-829-4833), Monday – Friday, 8 am – 8 pm (ET) and the team will help you directly.

If you received an error code from ID.me, please write it down and repeat it to the Help Desk.

Currently, you can only verify your identity online, but in the near-future VA will have in-person identity proofing at VA facilities and other locations. 



#### What if I already have an ID.me account?
[Sign in](https://api.id.me/en/session/new) and enter your ID.me username and password. You will then be asked for a 6-digit verification code that will be sent to your mobile or home phone. 



#### What if I already have a DS Logon Premium account?
[Sign in](https://myaccess.dmdc.osd.mil/identitymanagement/authenticate.do?execution=e1s1) and select the DS Logon link on the ID.me screen. Use your DS Logon information to login, and ID.me will receive your verified information. You may have to fill in some additional information.
