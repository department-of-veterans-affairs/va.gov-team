# Summary of audio recordings

Audio recordings of logging into staging with SSOe while using Mac Voice Over screen reader.

## Safari
In Safari, the redirects aren't read at all. The UX is pretty seamless. 
- Redirects can be heard from :20 to :23
- A sound effect is played in lieu of the reader reading any text or URL. 

## Chrome
In chrome, the redirects are much more prominent. 
- Redirects can be heard from :13 to :19 in the recording
- Both redirects are read out by Voice Over
