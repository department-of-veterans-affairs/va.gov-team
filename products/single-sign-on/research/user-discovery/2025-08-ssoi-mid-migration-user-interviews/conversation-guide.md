## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! May I call you _____________?
My name is Anne. I am a researcher with the VA, and I am part of the team working on the single sign on modernization effort with ICAM – Identity, Credential, and Access Management.
As you know, my colleague Aaron reached out to you as someone who completed the migration survey last month for your product _____________.
My goal today is to understand your experience with implementing Siteminder, and any thoughts or concerns you may have regarding the migration to EntraID.

- __This entire session should take about 30 minutes__. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- __In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.__ There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- I want to check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
- ___(Introducing colleagues)___ I also have a couple other colleagues that are going to be sitting in on this conversation today. I will allow them to introduce themselves. **(allow colleagues to introduce themselves)**
- __Are you comfortable if I record as we talk today?__ We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
- Knowing that, can I record this conversation as we talk today?
- \[Record answer here\]
- If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.
- ➡️ Start recording.
- __I have started recording.__ I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
