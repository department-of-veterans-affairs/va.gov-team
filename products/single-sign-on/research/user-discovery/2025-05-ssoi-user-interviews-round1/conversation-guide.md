# ICAM(SSO) User Interviews - Customers and End-users

# Purpose
The VA is modernizing how users such as employees and contractors access various services they need to do their jobs. This includes gaining access for applications, requesting access for team members, and provisioning for other users. This interview is to help us understand where your role fits into this spectrum of users.

# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! May I call you [first name]?
My name is Aaron, a UX researcher, and I work as part of a team that is modernizing how users, such as administrators, employees, and contractors access various/application systems they need to do their work. An example would be accessing your email to logging into software such as Datadog and MS Teams or other collaboration tools. Requesting access for team members, and provisioning for other users. This interview is to help us understand where your role fits into this spectrum of users.
(Introducing colleagues) I also have a couple other colleagues that are going to be sitting in on this conversation today. I will allow them to introduce themselves. (allow colleagues to introduce themselves)
Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

‚Ä¢	This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

‚Ä¢	In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

‚Ä¢	I want to check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?


‚Ä¢	Are you comfortable if I record as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.

o	Knowing that, can I record this conversation as we talk today?

o	If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

‚û°Ô∏è Start recording.

‚Ä¢	I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
