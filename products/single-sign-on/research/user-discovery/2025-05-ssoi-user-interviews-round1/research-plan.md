# **Research Plan for ICAM Single Sign-On User Interviews (Veteran), May 2025**

## Background 🏗️

**The VA is enhancing its modernization efforts by implementing a cloud-based Single Sign-On (SSO) solution for centralized authentication. This solution aims to complement current security standards, ensure easy integration, and provide a seamless experience for both workforce and external users. The modernization efforts are designed to be inclusive of workforce users, veterans, beneficiaries, and other users accessing public-facing applications.**

Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)

**ICAM SSO is an authentication service.**

**OCTO-DE Priorities**

Which OCTO priorities does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

Objective 2: OCTO’s platforms are the fastest, most efficient, and most secure way to deliver products at VA.

- **Key Result 1:** 100% of authentications to our systems and tools (both Veteran-facing and internal) occur using a secure credential.

Objective 3: OCTO teammates are empowered with the knowledge and resources they need to make sustained impact.

- **Key Result 3:** 75% or more team members are confident they have the knowledge needed to make effective decisions.

## Research Goals 🥅

1. Understand how users interact with ICAM (SSO).
2. Surface any pain points users experience interacting with ICAM (SSO).
3. Discover differences and similarities among the user types.

**Outcome**

This research will inform user type personas for Veterans, caregivers, beneficiaries, alt-MFA users, and non-Veteran SSOe users, and help inform user journey and service design efforts.

**Research questions**

1. What is the nature of Veterans’, caregivers’, delegates’, Service members’ or beneficiaries’ interaction with ICAM (SSO)?
2. What pain points do users experience while interacting with ICAM (SSO)?
3. What are the differences and commonalities among the various user types?

**Hypothesis**

Hypothesis 1: Many participants' expressed pain points will be with difficulty in understanding the process of how to obtain access to the needed services.

Hypothesis 2: Most differences among the user types will be between the Veteran and non-Veteran groupings.
