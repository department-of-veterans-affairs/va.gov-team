# Research findings for iFAMS Requirements Discovery Sessions 
### Participants and roles
The research team conducted interviews with three team members from iASOS, all of whom serve as System Accountants with 1 to 4 years of experience. These individuals are responsible for user provisioning and deprovisioning activities within iFAMS and manage access requests across all VA organizations, including VACO, VBA, VHA, and NCA. All three participants were familiar with Saviynt, and none reported working under a PIV exemption.

Additionally, four members of the Customer Support Team were interviewed. This group exclusively handles access requests for iFAMS. One participant was a team lead, while the remaining three were individual contributors. Two of these members had experience with the legacy FMS system prior to iFAMS’ implementation in 2020, while the other two joined after the transition. None of the Customer Support Team members were familiar with Saviynt, and none worked under a PIV exemption.

A separate session was held with over six members of the FOS team, who work solely within iFAMS. While this session provided valuable insights into system-related pain points, the findings were deemed out of scope for the current Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) focus. These participants were also unfamiliar with Saviynt and did not operate under a PIV exemption.

### Research goals
The primary goals of the research were to:

- Identify near-term and future UX improvement opportunities.
- Understand user familiarity with Saviynt and potential process changes.
- Gather diverse user perspectives to inform feature prioritization.
- Build consensus around product requirements identified during working sessions.

### Key themes and findings
#### 1. Role management
A majority of participants (6 out of 7) expressed a need for a consistent base organization structure. Four participants highlighted the lack of clarity in role descriptions. There was a shared desire for plain language codes for security organizations (sec orgs), which was echoed in both group and individual sessions.

Participants noted that users often misunderstand the purpose of selecting a profile, leading to incorrect access requests. One iASOS System Accountant stated, “Users think [selecting] a profile is giving them something that it's not.” Another emphasized that inconsistent base organization information is a frequent reason for request rejections. A Customer Support Representative added that users often do not know their base information, complicating the access provisioning process.

#### 2. Overall Usability
Three participants reported issues with the clarity and timeliness of system notifications. One CSR mentioned difficulty understanding automated emails from MVI.System, which often lack clarity on next steps or responsible parties. Another participant suggested that approval request emails need clearer instructions on required actions.

#### 3. Approval Workflow
All participants reported challenges with the current approval workflow. One participant advocated for a centralized access removal process, noting that decisions often involve multiple approvers who may not understand their roles. There was a strong desire to automate parts of the workflow to reduce manual input while maintaining necessary human oversight due to the complexity of access requests.

#### 4. Access Modification
There was unanimous agreement on the need for more flexibility in modifying access requests. Participants frequently encounter incomplete or incorrect requests and face delays due to unresponsive or misinformed approvers. Most participants expressed a desire to edit submitted or pending requests without having to cancel and resubmit them. One CSR noted, “The only way to have a role removed if it’s in Pending status is to cancel and resubmit,” while another added, “If we could just go in there and edit the request instead of completely canceling it, that’d be cool.”
