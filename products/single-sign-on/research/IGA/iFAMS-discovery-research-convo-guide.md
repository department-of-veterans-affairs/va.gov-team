# Research plan for iFAMS Requirements Discovery Sessions 
##### May 2025; internal VA employees

### Opening (2-4 mins)
- Thank you for joining today. What is your preferred name? 

- The session should take about an hour. The first half will be a general conversation about your experience working with various tools to complete your work responsibilities. 

- We will use your responses to feed good habits and processes to the new system and sift out what may not be working with the current processes. 
- We are not testing your abilities, auditing your performance, and there are no right or wrong answers to these questions. We just want to hear your unique perspective and understand how things relate to you. 
- Would it be ok if I recorded the session? 
  - [Start recording] 
  - To confirm, are you still ok with us recording the session? [Y: Continue; N: Ask preference]
 
### General (10-15 mins)
- Can you describe your role?
    - Are you a part of ASOS?
    - How long have you been in this particular role? 
    - Have you been in any other roles where you had to use iFAMS? FMS?  

- Walk us through the typical routine (additional prompts): 
    - How do you manage your system access–what is the process to request or modify?  
    - Do you manage access for others? 
    - How does the system fit into your typical day-to-day? 
    - What is/isn’t working with the current process? 

- Which agency reps do you work with most often? (possibly cut for time) 
    - Are they internal to VA, or external? 
    - How often do you communicate with them?
 
### Saviynt (6-8 mins)
- How much do you know about the effort to implement Saviynt? 
- What are the top things you hope are addressed? 
    - How do you think that Saviynt will make your current process better?
- From your perspective, is there a risk that some departments won’t adopt the new way of working? 
    - How do you think we could overcome that? What would onboarding look like?
    - Can you think of anything like that in your personal like that’s helpful?
 
### Sort what's important
- I am going to show you a working list of requirements. Can you help me sort these in priority order? It can be the order that best suits you as an individual, in other words, what would you do if the process were up to you.

- Do you think there’s anyone else we should talk to regarding product requirements, or anything else? 
- Would it be ok to reach out to you again? 
- [Thank again, stop recording]
