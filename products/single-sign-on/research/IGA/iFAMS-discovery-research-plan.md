# Research plan for iFAMS Requirements Discovery Sessions 
##### May 2025; internal VA employees
## Background üèóÔ∏è
The ICAM Next Gen UX team is conducting a series of studies to gather data to help streamline employee workflows and processes that relate to identity and access management services at VA. These changes intend to refine inefficiencies, increase productivity, and result in scalable solutions across the organization. 

The Integrated Financial and Acquisition Management System (iFAMS) users manage payments across organizations like VHA, VBA, VACO and NCA. Given the number of organizations and the complexity of their structure‚Äìtheir roles and entitlements‚Äìthese users have specific needs to consider when designing workflows to meet their needs in Saviynt. We will identify future solutions, like finding ways to incorporate their requests within Saviynt customizations. 

`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

- IGA refers to the access governance tool used to manage SSOi user access.
iFAMS is the current system that VA employees use to complete financial and acquisition tasks that support VBA, VHA, NCA, VACO.

`What is Veterans‚Äô familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

- N/A ‚Äì This research does not directly involve Veterans. It involves the employees working within organizations that support their services.

#### [OCTO-DE Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md) 
<details><summary>Which OCTO priorities does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed. </summary>

##### Objective 2: OCTO‚Äôs platforms are the fastest, most efficient, and most secure way to deliver products at VA.
- Key Result 1: 100% of authentications to our systems and tools (both Veteran-facing and internal) occur using a secure credential.
- Key Result 2: We have reduced the total error rates in our platforms by 50% compared to Q4 2024, towards a goal less than 1% per endpoint.

##### Objective 4: OCTO positively influences VA's ability to deliver software products and services faster, safer, and with higher quality.
- Key Result 1: OCTO has delivered at least 10 impactful artifacts or learning activities (e.g., trainings, guides, COP meetings) focused on improving delivery practices that achieve an NPS score of 30 or higher from the target OIT delivery staff.
- Key Result 2: OCTO has helped resolve/support at least 10 significant engineering issues or products outside our portfolio.
- Key Result 3: Five or more non-OCTO teams have used SPRUCE to deliver high quality software.

## Research Goals ü•Ö
`What are you trying to learn from this research?`

### Goals
1. Identify UX opportunities to address in the near term, as well as future implementation.

2. Connect with a broad set of users to understand many perspectives to inform feature prioritization.

3. Gain consensus for the product requirements identified in the working sessions.

### Outcome
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

The IGA UX Lead will facilitate discovery sessions to gain insight into the current process for employees who assign and execute roles for financial management purposes. We aim to use these sessions to validate user requirements and learn from financial and acquisition professionals at VA who use iFAMS. Once the sessions are complete, we will synthesize what we‚Äôve learned and share the outcomes with internal and external teams as appropriate. We will use the findings to prioritize and execute product requirements. 

We will use human-centered research principles to ensure that users feel comfortable sharing insights as it relates to their work, while also having a stake in what happens next. This process will use insights gathered from previous iFAMS/IGA working sessions to help us gain consensus for what‚Äôs important and gather additional thoughts to track as we continue to learn about their process. These sessions will help us gain insight for the next iteration of governance at VA, as it relates to iFAMS. We feel that these users have a specific use case, so narrowing the scope for implementation is critical. 

#### Research questions
1. What pain points do iFAMS administrators notice in their current experience? 

2. What impediments prevent efficiency in the overall process? 

3. How might we avoid repeating inefficient processes when migrating to the new tool? 

#### Hypotheses

- Hypothesis 1: Participants will uncover complex workflows that inform changes to the key stakeholder's journey.

- Hypothesis 2: The information derived from the group's working sessions will be limited; participants will add more priorities that aren't represented.

### Methodology üõ†Ô∏è
TL;DR: Semi-structured interviews, and a Prioritization exercise

We will conduct a remote, moderated semi-structured conversation with 8 participants that operate in roles that range from accountants to managers. We will schedule individual sessions with each participant and use virtual collaboration tools to conduct the sessions. These 1-1 sessions help us expand the view of the team‚Äôs challenges. This structure is different from the recent series of team working sessions; we will collect unbiased feedback and probe for more details about previously reported issues. The first half of the session will consist of generative questions about their current process. We will ask open-ended questions so that conversation does not lead them to a particular response or guide them in any way. We will learn how they use existing tools to complete their tasks and gather ideas for how they may improve the current processes with new tools.  

We will use the second half to conduct a prioritization exercise to rank the importance of the requirements heard in recent teamwide working sessions with iFAMS users. This activity helps define the requirements beyond the working sessions. We will list each requirement on a digital whiteboard and ask them to sort them in order of priority (most important to least important). Each participant will respond based on their unique perspective, without the influence of their peers or managers. If a requirement is not listed, we will ask them to list it and take note of the participant‚Äôs unique entry. Then, we will aggregate this data to uncover patterns and prioritize next steps for the product team. 

#### Location
Interviews will be conducted via Teams.
