## Overview
*After you've explored the problem and through testing / hypothesis have identified the ideal solution, write up one sentence describing the solution you'll be creating.*

## Problem Statement
VA serves a vast network of users, including Veterans, employees, contractors, and partner organizations, who need secure, seamless access to VA systems and services. However, VA lacks a modern, enterprise-wide Single Sign-On (SSO) solution that is scalable, compliant with federal standards, and easy to use. This creates significant challenges across the organization, from poor user experience and fragmented access systems to increased security risks and operational inefficiencies. These issues span both internal systems used by the workforce and public-facing platforms accessed by Veterans and beneficiaries.

How might we reimagine VA’s SSO infrastructure to provide secure, streamlined, and equitable access for all users, while supporting operational agility, collaboration, and future-ready service delivery?
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- As a Veteran I can access multiple VA services (healthcare, benefits, education, etc.) with a single set of login credentials, reducing the need to remember multiple passwords.

- As a VA Employee or Veteran, I experience consistent, quicker, more seamless access to systems, reducing login frustration and streamlining the interactions with the VA’s digital resources.

- As a VA IT Administrator, I reduce the time spent managing multiple credentials, allowing us to focus more on delivering services to veterans and improving overall productivity. I also speed up time to production (and save application teams time and money) by providing one clear SSO solution that is easy for application teams to integrate with for each user population.

- As a VA Cybersecurity specialist, I can enforce security policies, manage access controls, and monitor for suspicious activity, to reduce the risk of breaches and improve compliance with federal cybersecurity regulations like FISMA and NIST guidelines.

- As a VA Executive Leader, I achieve strategic goals related to digital transformation, security, service delivery, enhancing the organization’s overall operational efficiency and provide a more secure, user-friendly environment for both veterans and employees.

## Undesired User Outcomes


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Delivery and maintenance of the product strategy and roadmap for SSO modernization.

- Delivery of the transition roadmap from legacy SSO services and integrations to the modern solution.

- Provide high resiliency and reliability services for enterprise SSO.

- Ensure SSO user experiences align with the broader ICAM experience goals and strategy.

- Speed up time to production (and saves application teams time and money) by providing one clear SSO solution that is easy for application teams to integrate with.

- Simplify maintenance because existing applications don't need to implement authentication and access management individually.

- Enable self-service management throughout the application lifecycle (via a simple User Interface and configuration as code).

- Provide cost savings to VA. One source of cost is the maintenance required by VA Enterprise Cloud (VAEC) to increase the availability of the current SSOi and SSOe solutions.

- Enable advanced authentication capabilities (ex. adaptive, risk-based access) improving alignment with Zero Trust framework

- 100% of network access occurs with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) without exception

- Leverage automation wherever possible to improve SSO reliability, support and maintenance.

- Maintain the ATO for the SSO tool to ensure that it remains compliant with VA security requirements and best practices.

- 100% of VA applications integrated with the legacy SSO services are integrated with the modern SSO services to enable decommissioning of the legacy solutions.

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Failure to Integrate Legacy Systems: The SSO systems cannot connect seamlessly with existing legacy applications, causing users to juggle multiple logins and defeating the purpose of SSO.

- Data Loss or Migration Errors: Critical user data is lost or corrupted during migration, leading to service disruptions or forcing manual recovery processes, which delay access to essential services for veterans and staff.

- Security Breaches: Weaknesses in the SSO implementations leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information, resulting in data breaches that compromise Veterans' personal health and financial data, along with federal compliance violations.

- Performance Bottlenecks: The SSO systems experiences performance issues or crashes during periods of high demand, causing widespread service outages that affect VA employees and Veterans, interrupting the delivery of vital healthcare or benefits.

- Low User Adoption: Users, both Veterans and VA employees, struggle to adapt to the new SSO systems due to poor user experience, poor training and communication, leading to frustration, decreased productivity, and continued reliance on outdated systems.

- Inconsistent Access Management: Identity management issues arise where access controls across legacy and cloud systems are not properly synchronized, resulting in security gaps or unintended restrictions that hinder users from accessing critical applications.

- Vendor Lock-In: The agency becomes overly dependent on a single cloud vendor, limiting future flexibility and making it difficult or costly to change providers or adopt new technologies as needs evolve.

- Incompatibility with Partner Systems: The SSO systems fail to integrate with systems of partner agencies or external providers, creating barriers to collaboration and preventing users from accessing shared resources efficiently.

- Service Downtime: The cloud providers experiences outages, leading to widespread access issues that disrupt essential VA services, negatively impacting Veterans and causing a loss of trust in the system’s reliability.

- Budget Overruns: Unforeseen costs—such as additional licenses, customization, or extended support—lead to significant budget overruns, delaying the project and diverting resources from other critical initiatives within VA.

- Inconsistent Quality of Experience: Experiences created for SSO create unusually frequent/severe user pain points, negative user sentiment, temporal/cognitive load, or general complexity of tasks, inconsistent with broader ICAM experience goals.

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
