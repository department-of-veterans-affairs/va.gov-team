## Notification Preferences - Communication Items & Different Types of Consent 


# Context:

1- Explicit Consent: Setting preference on VA.gov, messaging start stop on some number - this will result in a specific setting being written back to VA Profile and reflecting in the radio button in VA.gov relative to that specific communication item

2- Implicit Consent: Communication items may have implicit consent strategies i.e. filling out a VA.gov form and sharing contact information - this will allow VA.gov to send notifications to the user assuming there is no explicit consent preference set that contra-indicts
 
If a user expresses their preference, VANotify will always honor and prioritize that. If the user has not expressed a preferences for that specific communication item â€“ we will follow the business rule, which is determined by their consent strategy.



# Key Question:

Do, and if so how do we surface communication items that have implicit consent in the VA.gov Preferences experience? 
 

# Current State: 

Veterans will receive some communication items via an implicit consent strategy and in that case will not see any indication of that on VA.gov preferences. 

# User Explicit Permission Settings

* True - preference is set to "Send"\
* False - preference is set to "Do not send"\
* Null - no preference is set

# Proposed Future State

**Communication Item Implicit Permission Settings**

* True - notification is sent to anyone without explicit prefence set to false 
* False - notification requires explicit consent set by user in order to send
