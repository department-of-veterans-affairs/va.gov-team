# Playbook

## Who we are
VA Notify is a notifications platform dedicated to improving the Veteran’s notification experience by providing actionable, unified communications on the VA services they utilize. Our notification service is available to any business line/team inside the VA or with an ATO.
## What we are
VA Notify is designed to be a passthrough system. We do not store Veteran information, but we do store your notification templates and settings. We partner with VA Profile and va.gov to provide communication preferences that the Veteran can see and manage. VA Notify checks these preferences before notifying a Veteran.

VA Notify is located within the VAEC. We provide a REST OpenAPI, which your system can call each time a notification is needed. We also provide a Self Service web application so you can directly create and maintain your notification templates. Aggregated message metrics are provided. Google Analytics (UTM trackers) can and should be used for all message links that point to va.gov, so clicks can be captured. 

If you have forms on va.gov and need help developing a notification trigger (ex., submission confirmation, reminders to complete forms, etc.), our [Forms Strike Team](https://github.com/department-of-Veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/form%20confirmations) can help!

## What we aren’t

VA Notify does not…
- Pull data to trigger notification events
- Provide notification scheduling services, though we may throttle or queue notifications based on volume concerns
- Support newsletter notifications
- Store Veteran data
- Track analytics per Veteran

## Supported notification channels (types)
Currently we support email, text messaging (SMS), push notifications with the Flagship Mobile App, and onsite notifications on VA.gov, My VA dashboard. You can find the VA Standard Operating Procedures for SMS [here](https://github.com/department-of-Veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-notify/VA%20SOP%20for%20Delivering%20SMS%20Messages%20v1.0.pdf).

## Onboarding to VA Notify
Welcome! Please submit an [intake form](https://github.com/department-of-Veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=christy-tongty%2C+mjones-oddball%2C+GitSamJennings&labels=vanotify-intake&template=VANotify-Business-Intake.md&title=Business+intake+form+for+%5BBusiness+or+team%5D) to kick off the process. This lets us know a little bit more about you and what you’re trying to accomplish to ensure VA Notify is a good fit. From there we may schedule a kick-off meeting to learn more and guide you through next steps.

## Getting access to our Self Service Portals
The VA Notify self service portal empowers your team to create and manage notification templates, while also providing helpful documentation and tips for your notification journey.

We provide Staging and Production access. Staging should be used for testing purposes and can be connected to one or more of your lower environments (e.g. dev and qa). Once you feel everything is working as expected, you can copy and paste content into Production. We will provision your user and provide an API key per environment via an encrypted VA email to one of your technical team members. We may provide initial access via our Test Service on Staging depending where you’re at in the process.

Please note: to access a lower environment with PIV, i.e. Staging, your user must be provisioned with a SecID in the [IAM system](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/OITEPMOIAM/playbooks/Pages/ssoi/SSOi%20Setup.aspx) within the appropriate environment. VA Notify Staging is integrated with the SQA IAM environment. Every user automatically gets provisioned in Production, so no extra step is needed there. You can request this yourself or ask VA Notify to help!

**How do I sign in to staging?**
1. Go to https://staging.notifications.va.gov while connected to the VA Network
2. Sign in with your PIV using the button at the top right
3. Let us know you’ve signed in, send us your va.gov email address, and we will assign you to the right service for your team.

**How do I sign in to production?**
1. Go to https://notifications.va.gov while connected to the VA Network
2. Sign in with your PIV using the button at the top right
3. Let us know you’ve signed in, send us your va.gov email address, and we will assign you to the right service for your team.

## Timeframe
The exact timing depends on your team’s schedule and the type of notification.

Email is much quicker to launch than SMS because there are less steps. SMS requires us to acquire sender phone number(s) for your use case (short codes or 10DLCs), which can take up to 12 weeks. If communication preferences are needed, we must account for scheduling with the VA Profile and Authenticated Experience teams to add this. Outside of these tasks, the timeline really comes down to your engineering effort and how quickly a Privacy Officer can do a content review. Please note we collaborate with all of our users on their content to ensure it meets VA standards. For SMS, please review our [standard operating procedures](https://github.com/department-of-Veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-notify/VA%20SOP%20for%20Delivering%20SMS%20Messages%20v1.0.pdf).

If your notification requires VA Notify engineering work, we will review and provide a schedule.

## General Steps 
Please note, this may differ based on your use case.
(*) = Your team, (**) = Joint effort between your team and VA Notify

- Submit the intake form *
- Kick-off with VA Notify **
- Have your technical team review the VA Notify API docs *
- Get access to the Self Service Portal **
- Budget approval for notifications *
- Create your notification content (Privacy Officer review required) *
- VA Notify submits a communication preference intake for your team (if applicable)
    - Please note, if you have a new communication preference your team will need to determine a plan to communicate this to Veterans so they know a new notification is available to opt into.
- SMS only: VA Notify requests applicable phone number(s)
- Build your notification code to call the VA Notify API *
- Test your notification *
- Launch your notification **
- Evaluate business outcomes and make revisions as needed *

## Billing
VA Notify charges for SMS text messages to cover phone number and messaging costs. The process for transfering funds is currently under review and discussion. We can provide billing estimates and reports so you can plan within your budget until a process to transfer funds is available.

## Reviewing our API docs
Your technical team can review the [API documentation](https://staging.notifications.va.gov/developer/api_docs) and other technical information on our Self Service Portal.

To send a notification, you must first create a template in our Self Service Portal. There are different template types available (email/SMS). Once created, you can find a template ID under template details. This will be used in the API call to trigger the notification. Please note, if you use personalisations (dynamic content) in your template(s) you must include them in the notification request body.

For teams using vets-api to trigger notification requests, please see https://github.com/department-of-Veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/modules/va_notify/README.md

## Delivery Status Callbacks
Callbacks provide status updates per notification sent, so your team can track individual successes and failures. 

### Callback Requirements
- Provide a webhook URL for Staging and Production
- VA Notify uses bearer tokens for authenticating with services when making a callback. The bearer token can be any form that the called service endpoint accepts. These should be long-lived, but not permanent, bearer tokens.
    - This should be sent to VA Notify via encrypted VA email
    - Each service will have their own policy for updating a long-lived bearer token. Contact VA Notify if an updated bearer token is required to meet security policies.
    - We recommend not hardcoding acceptance of only a single bearer token, so bearer token updates are not disruptive.

### Sample Information Included in Callbacks
```
"id":"6ba01111-f3ee-4a45-9d04-234asdfb6abbb9a",  -- this is the notification id
"reference":null,  
"to":"",  -- this is the recipient's contact info
"status":"delivered",  -- this will specify the delivery status of the notification
"created_at":"2023-01-10T00:04:25.273410Z",  
"completed_at":"2023-01-10T00:05:33.255911Z",  
"sent_at":"2023-01-10T00:04:25.775363Z",  
"notification_type":"SMS",   -- this is the channel/type of notification
"status_reason": "", -- populated if there's additional context on the delivery status
"provider":"pinpoint"
```
