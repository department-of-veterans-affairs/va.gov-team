# VA Notify Sample Template Conversation Guide for User Testing

## Purpose
The purpose of this study is to test the usability of the sample template tab within the self service interface with users and gather feedback. During this study, our goal is to answer the following questions.
- Are participants able to successfully navigate the interface and perform the requested tasks?
- Are the necessary features available at the right time?
- Do participants feel more confident about properly formatting notifications?

## Method
Participants will be given a series of tasks to complete using a clickable prototype. The sessions will be remotely moderated over Zoom. Each session will have one participant and run 30 minutes.

## Participants
Our target participants are internal VA team members, some who have worked with VA Notify and some who have not. Our goal is five participants from a variety of disciplines.

## Conversation Guide
### Before testing:
-   Thanks for joining us today! My name is Elissa and this is Ian we’re user experience researchers work with the VA.  We have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes.  
-   As User Experience designers, we test experiences and try to find ways to make them better  

### Ok to Record?
-   This will only be shown to our team and used for our reference  
-   Are you ok with being recorded?  
  
### Testing the Application, Not You
-   Even though we call it a test, we are not testing you, we’re testing the application  
-   If you can’t figure out how to do something, then it’s a reflection of the design, not you  
-   Please be as open and honest as possible; we’re looking for opportunities to improve the interface, so you won’t offend us with your feedback.  

### Please Think Out Loud
-   We’re going to give you some tasks to complete today to see how the interface is working for you  
-   We ask that you think out loud as you go through these tasks, and talk us through what you’re doing  
    
### Only a Prototype
-   What you’ll be looking at today is only a prototype, so there might be some placeholder content and not everything will be working.  
-   If there is something that isn’t working, please let us know what you would expect it to do.  
-   And remember to be open and honest; we won’t be offended by your feedback

**Do you have any questions before we get started?**

Today we’re looking at an interface called VA Notify. VA Notify is a new platform that allows the VA to send digital notifications to Veterans, and beneficiaries, some notification types include confirmation of receipt, notifications of changes to accounts, and pharmacy delivery tracking for Veterans.

### Tasks
**So, let’s imagine that you are working for a service line within the VA and you want to create an email notification that confirms that a Veteran has successfully submitted a 1010-EZ form. You log into VA Notify and this is the screen you are presented with. Where would you go from here?**
-   Can the user locate the create an email button?
-   Do they select email from the options?

**Because the prototype doesn’t allow for text entry, we’ve done that step for you and named it 1010-EZ Confirmation. What do you expect to be able to do from here?**
-   Pretend we’re not here and do what you normally would (while thinking out loud).
-   What were you hoping to find here?
-   Any other thoughts on what you see here (feedback in general)?
-   How was that process? How could the process be improved?
-   Was the information provided what you expected to see here? Why or why not?
-   What are you looking for here? What were you hoping to do?
-   Let’s say you have a magic wand - what do you wish this tool could do that it can't today?

*If the user doesn’t engage with the sample template feature:*
**Let’s say you started typing up a notification, but then got stuck. Is there anything available here that could help?**

*Once they click on the sample template tab:*
**What are some things you can do here?**
- Is this what you expected to see here?
- Does this information make sense?
- What other information might they find valuable?

### Wrap-up
- Can you describe your overall experience while completing the tasks? What worked well, what didn’t?
- Is this something you think would be helpful/that you would use?
- Is there anything missing from the interface you would expect?
