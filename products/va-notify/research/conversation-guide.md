# Veteran Email Preferences Conversation Guide


## Intro - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Ian/Elissa, and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes. We are here today to talk about the Veteran Email Preferences. I am going to ask you a series of questions to help us understand what types of information are useful in emails for Veterans. 

**Before we start, there are a few things I'd like to mention:**



* We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.   
* There are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the application and meet Veterans' needs. 
* I won’t be offended by any opinions you express. 
* This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question.
* I’ll be recording the audio as we talk today, so that we capture your opinions accurately. Only our conversation will be recorded. We are not sharing screens or using video recording. 
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?

Great! Any questions before we get started?

Ok, I'm going to hit the record button now. *Start audio and screen recording.*
