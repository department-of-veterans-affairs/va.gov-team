1. **PARTICIPANT 02: INTERVIEW**
1. 
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Alright. So just to learn a little bit about yourself here. Can you tell us what branch of the military you served in?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Sure. Air Force.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And when did you retire or separate from the air force? All right.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Yeah. Sorry. I retired in 2020 late 2020. Ok. During COVID. Very odd. Oh, wow.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, there's a lot going on then, right?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. So what a strange time for sure.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Since then have you, or do you currently receive emails from the va?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Absolutely.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Any particular ones come to mind?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Oh, yeah. So, well, I'm not using education benefits now, but I was so there was that, just admin notifications, you know, of course for routine things, password changes, medical, for like appointments, responses for, you know, pharmacy. What else? I do some things like that. I arranged whatever the proper term is for burial, you know. Mhm. So variety.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Sounds like it really runs the gamut then. What about your like experience receiving these emails? What is that like? Is, do you find them helpful informative? They come too frequently. Not enough, like, all that kind of stuff.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Yeah. Well, I suppose I could. So I'll start out by saying I, I'm, I'll give feedback though if I really wanted to change it. I know I probably could, you know, in some sort of settings and then I forgot the, the sort of like VA news, email that comes out. Ok. I'm not sure periodically. So I tried to peruse that. So I think they like VA news one is probably a decent frequency, but there's just usually, fortunately there are just a few, like, highlights on there. But there's so many little things embedded. I, I just don't even look at most of them. Ok. And I don't think that's about frequency. Right. I mean, it could be once a quarter getting that email and I'm not, I mean, I would have to let you know you'd consciously sit down to explore each of these things and, and that's ok. You know, I'm not sick of that but the frequency for that, you know, va news or whatever that is called, I think is fine. I get, I don't know how many emails when I have an appointment it seems like, I get maybe weekly or fortnightly. I'm not sure, maybe an email about medical appointments and it's kind of nice, you know, especially because things change. So it's a quick, easy check for. Oh, these are the, the ones that the VA thinks are scheduled. Yep, that checks with what I think is scheduled. That's important. But then it'll be like, you know, you have an appointment coming up next week and then you have an appointment coming up in a few days. Hey, you have an appointment tomorrow. Hey, you have an appointment in a couple hours and, I get the value of that, but it's like I just end up deleting, delete, delete. I'd have a rule that sets them to a separate folder, but I'm leery of like missing something that matters. So it's like, yeah, you know, the, the wheat and chaff kind of thing. I think there's a little bit, the, whatever the default settings are or what I'm on. So, whatever that default for medical appointments seems to be just a bit more than I personally need. Is that helpful? Feedback?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, very much. What about, things
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. I'll say all your feedback is helpful.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Absolutely.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. All of it. All of it just, you could turn on a fire hose and we'd be. Yes, please. So, ok.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. So I'll give you this though, the content of the, of the emails, those scheduling, like when I have a medical appointment, I don't, I don't really have any issues with that. It seems I like that. It seems mostly text based. Right. So it's simple. It'll load, it quickly, you know, digestible if you will. I guess, and it's not too busy right to the point you have to have it has, you know, the usual kind of info that I don't care about probably. But you really need that. I understand for liability and inevitably one time out of arbitrary number. Oh, like, I don't know, like, I'm just acknowledging that there's more in there. You see, actually I'll tell you what I, right now. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Let me see. I'll go to my VA folder. This is great va appointment reminder. Yeah, I just like that. It's rather succinct. This is a reminder, blah, blah, blah, upcoming appointments. Oh, and then it's, yeah, what I mean is, was last updated on this date and then it's the you know, the, the boilerplate before your appointment, please confirm it, call and confirm. I'm not gonna call and confirm my appointment. That's the point of this email. Coronavirus. If you do quick reference guide, if you need to change your email, if you receive this, that's what I mean. All those, all those postscript if you will caveats or, or, or that's what I'm alluding to. That's arbitrary number of 99 out of 100 times I don't care, but it's important that it be there and I accept that. So other than that, what I'm saying is, it's a, it's an effective communication, the content of the email is effective communication. It's just a little bit more frequent. That default is a little bit more frequent than I think I personally want.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, so they just to reiterate so I can make sure that I'm hearing what you're saying and correct me if I misinterpreted, there's a lot of other, like sometimes redundant information, but also could be helpful content in addition to what you actually wanna know for the appointment, but you're not mad at it and you're like under there's like you're fine with all the extra stuff being in there. It's just the frequency that is really the fri the friction point there.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Sure. And honestly there's not, I mean, I don't mean to nit pick or anything. So I'm like, I don't consider it a a friction point, everything. Yes, I'm with you. It's just not a big deal. I'm just part of that default setting is just a bit more than I need. Yeah. So they just get deleted sometimes I don't even open them, which I'm realizing means that it's not working. So yeah, I guess it is not working in that sense because if I'm conditioned to point that I delete an email before I read it, then that is ineffective communication. Oh, ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. As far as like the type of communication that you get from the va it, the way you're being communicated towards now, like as far as like emails and letters and text messages, do you feel like the type of messaging you're getting for the type of message seems appropriate or what's your preference on how you receive those? Does it change anything like that?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. My preference is email and I'm content with that. I continue to get like regular mail, postal mail notifications of things. And I can't seem to find an opt out. I understand. You know, there are massive demographics, you know, especially in a va world who really probably need that. But it does seem that I, if I could find and opt out for that, I certainly would. And text I don't care for, but I, I'm sure there might be an opt out in there when I get them. I usually just ignore them. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. And before we move on, is there anything that you wanted to add to this part? No. Yeah. No, this is great.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. This is awesome, loving it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. It is useful. So we're kind of gonna ask some, we're gonna go through different email types that might come from the VA I mean, they, they come from the VA but you may or may not have seen them before. But so some of the questions we're gonna ask might seem a little redundant from scenario to scenario. But, you know, there's different cases for things and just wanna make sure we're capturing like expectations on your part and what you like, don't like all that stuff. So for the first one I wanna ask do you have experience receiving any debt related emails from the VA?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Oh, yes, actually, yeah, I did, two years ago maybe. It was an education benefit thing but ok, I don't remember actually, I'm assuming I got emails about it because I get emails and texts about everything. Would you want me to check?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. No, that's ok. I'm just curious if, if there was anything that kind of stood out to you that you like remembered about getting that email, but if it was that long ago, it probably is not like that easy.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. I definitely remember getting a letter about it and I'm not actually, I don't know if I did get an email come to think of it. Because I probably would have jumped on it had I received an email.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Well, let's say you did get an email. What kind of information would you expect to have in that email?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Oh, a clear notification. We're talking specifically about a debt notification. Yeah. Yeah. So definitely like, hey, this is what we think you owe us the dollar amount, maybe a breakdown if it's not one straightforward, right? The when, right? And and I guess the why or what, depending on what your your perspective is like. Is this you know, for an overpayment of benefit or you know, whatever it is. Ok. Oh, and of course, sorry. No one very important thing that I remember being confused by was like how to rectify it or what to expect because that wasn't very clear. I remember in that process it was more like, no, no, we'll sort it eventually, which was not, that's not what I want.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. Yeah, that seems a little confusing. So let's say that you receive this email and Ian's gonna share his screen and I'm gonna give you a second to just kind of look it over. And then while you're looking it over, if you wanna, you know, sort of think out loud as you're looking through stuff, what do you think this is about? And is there anything that you would do from here?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Yeah. So honestly, I would probably not click and link because it could be anything, it could be some routine thing and it likely is because that's the sort of thing that one would get with some vague message like that. Also, it's a separate matter, but like logging in is a convoluted process still. So I don't wanna do it until I'm sitting down and can do my verification and stuff. So I would probably dismiss it, delete it and just figure next time I log in, I'll try to remember to look for that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. So, well, let's say that you receive this next email shortly after this one. Tell us what your thoughts would be and what actions you would take if any.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Yeah, so that debt management would get more attention for sure. I personally would not, I might not be able to deal with that at the moment that I read it initially. Right. But I would certainly make time to deal with it that day. Go figure out what the info is. I can understand that gory details might not be included in an email. But, it's still what I want even though that's, that's
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So what, what kind of gory details, fill us in, what do, what do you expect?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. I told you before. Well, I don't expect to see it because I know it's not a realistic expectation. I mean, in the same sense that my bank isn't going to send me an email saying, hey, this deposit came in with this exact amount from this place, you know. And, and I would argue that they shouldn't just like I could argue that the VA shouldn't send me, you know, how much, why? Right in an, in an email, it should be behind, you know, the, the login function and I understand that, but it's still what I want when I want it. I know it's not practical or right?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Ok. So, so just to just to clarify, you're saying you, you understand that the reason that there might be reasons that you can't have it, but that doesn't mean that you still don't want it is that
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Certainly. I acknowledge that the user isn't right all, all the time you know, but I want it now.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. That's, that's kind of funny because our motto is always the user is right.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. I'm definitely right about what I want. It doesn't mean it's the right thing. Yep.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Fair. That's fair.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Would you assume that these are about the same thing?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. I, I wouldn't. Ok. Now that I look back to it, I'm sorry, just a moment. Now that I'm comparing them, I'm taking the time to compare them. I see the link itself says it, it appears to be the same URL. So there I might make that assumption, but I, I probably wouldn't have noticed. Let me say that very specifically, I didn't notice the word get in that link in the first message in this context where I probably should have been looking for it, you know, because I mean, you gave me quite a clue, you know what I mean? So I still didn't even look and notice that, right?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. And the first one, the only thing that says debt is the tail end of the link.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Right.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. OK.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. OK. Of the gory details. Is there anything that you feel would be appropriate for this email to contain?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. So, acknowledging that, you know, to continue the, the unnecessary pop culture quotes, you know, you can't always get what you want. I think I'd…what might be reasonable would be like at least an inkling as to, well, maybe it's in here because it's health, but as to like, is this an education benefit related thing? Is it a, oh, I don't know, you know, any of those, you know, like what sort of that it might be related to. But again, as long as it's cluing me into debt management, that's what I need and everything else will be behind the login. So, I'm sorry, that was thinking out loud and I,
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. That's perfect. That's exactly what we want you to do. That's great. Yep. Yeah. Big fans of the thinking out loud.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. So you know what, I'm sorry, excuse me, if there was like a way to communicate an urgency. So there's, there's implied urgency. Anytime there's a debt acknowledged. But I mean, like if there's a, you gotta do something by date X or it's just gonna be, or we're gonna take whatever action we're taking. I mean, that would be useful right again. Think it out loud and I have no idea how feasible that would be, seems convoluted, but there it is.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. No, that's, I think that's very helpful. Any additional thoughts on this before we move on to the next one? No, no. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Oh, I just wanted to jump in and ask n I'll, I'll, I'll tip our hat here and say that the first one is a copay email.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. And the second one is an overpayment of benefits.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Sure.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Knowing that,
1. **Participant 02:**
1. …that the veterans health admin. Yeah, that gives some of that away. I think
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. …knowing, knowing that would you, would you want, would you want anything different in these?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. So I guess what I'm thinking is even if it would just be the realm of like, so the combo of, “whoa debt management,” that's important. I'm not gonna ignore this but maybe the realm of like health or benefit or you know, whatever it is in addition to that.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Ok, cool. Thanks.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. For the next email type that we'll be talking about. Can you tell me if you have any experience appealing a decision from the va regarding your benefits, for example.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Oh, not yet.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. I'm happy to hear that
1. **Participant 02:**
1. It's, it's on the back burner and I don't want to deal with it.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Oh, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Well, let's say that you appealed a decision with the VA, the decision that the VA made about your benefits and they sent you a communication about it. What type of information would you expect to be in that email?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Oh, shit. I guess the exact, wait. OK, wait, wait, wait. So they declined something and I intend to appeal or I did appeal?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. You did appeal it.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Ok. I did appeal. They're getting back to me. Well, so acknowledge the are are we at that stage like acknowledge the appeal, all that stuff or I'm sorry, what did you, was it declining?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, you, you appealed the decision that the VA made about your benefits and they sent you an email.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Ok. Yeah. So, I mean, it should be some sort of confirmation, I guess of that. I appealed it when I appealed it, when the effective date of the appeal would be. Right. What exactly I appealed, I guess the grounds confirming what evidence probably was submitted. I don't know if all of this, I don't really know the process that well, but here's what I'm thinking, right.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. I don't either. This is good
1. **Participant 02:**
1. …confirm, like confirm what's required for an appeal, I guess maybe or what, what I submitted because I probably know what's required where it is or where it's gonna go. Right and, and where it is, everybody's gonna be unhappy with the timeline, I'm sure, but I'd still wanna estimated timeline how to get updates if, if desired or required. Yeah, I don't, I don't know what else.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Well, why don't we show you an example and take a look at it, take a second to kind of read through it and if you, you know, wanna talk through it, that's great. And let us know what kind of questions you have about this email and, oh, so a decision was you, I got you.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. So that's more pressing for sure. So again, I get that what I want isn't the right choice. You know what I mean? All that information loose in an email but there's like a, the, you know, tracking number, essentially docket number in this case. And that's quite important. And the clear link, how to get what I want is right there. So that's pretty important also. It says it'll be sent to you and to your representative. So that's cool if you have one, how to contact with more questions. So I, I assume if I had multiple appeals and I would already be tracking them by docket number. So that's probably not. I, I guess I'm confirming with you. Oh If that's a, if that's tracking an individual like decision, Let me say this, let me retract this and, and better communicate what I'm thinking. So if I have multiple appeals in the works, I'd wanna make sure that I could easily figure out which appeal this is and I'm assuming that the docket number is going to be unique to each appeal and not unique to, to certain steps in that process. Am I effectively communicating with you?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. You are. And I don't know, but I, I think that sounds like a good assumption.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Yeah, that's all I'm thinking. I have, I have some friends who have like four or five appeals and they get it all mixed up all the messaging, which is understandable.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. What are your thoughts on Just having the docket number? Is that helpful?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Just that you mean and then the link?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Oh, no, I just mean as a reference point.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Yeah, I mean, I wanna have something, I guess that's what I was alluding to in the previous comment. So again, if there were multiple, multiple appeals in process and I definitely wanna know which one this is about understanding that they're not gonna be able to give me the gory, you know, details.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Do you have any questions about what's being presented in this email?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. No, no, I don't. Again, ignorance of the process.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Do you feel like it's providing you with enough information?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. It's enough information to get the information that I want.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok
1. **Participant 02:**
1. I assume I, I want more. I, I think I, I consistently am saying that but I understand that that's not, you know, necessarily the right legal way. But as long as there's a unique, you know, like appeal reference and then assuming it's whatever is behind that, that link that's gonna truly answer whether or not it's, it's useful. But the, so this message is, hey, this is an important thing. It's about this particular appeal, you know, communicated via reference number. So go to this link. So I think it it serves its purpose.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Ian any questions that you want to follow up with before we move to the next one?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah. No, I'm good.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. OK, thanks. Mhm. All right. So we're gonna move on and we're gonna take a look at another email type. So for this situation, let's say that you've submitted a document to the VA and something on the back end went wrong, for example, like a system error and it caused the document that you submitted to not be filed and you receive an email. What details would you want or expect that email to include? Oh my gosh.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Well, in minimum what you said. So document, but I wanna know which document which is hard because I don't know how they do that. I don't even know. Hm. Huh. So I guess a document you tried uploading. A document, a date, and time, and place - electronic place I mean, and it failed. Hm. What I obviously need to know is which one it was or which ones they were? So I don't know how that could be communicated other than just when we upload them. I don't remember if they are separate folders. Boy, I just have to go sort through it all and figure out what's missing.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Let's say, oh sorry, go ahead, go ahead. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. No, you're fine. It's good. So let's say you received this email. What do you think about, you know, the content and what it's providing you? Is it enough information? Is there anything confusing?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. So I don't think it would be very clear to me if not for the context of this. Like what you said before I read this, that something that there was an up like a document, you know, failure kind of thing. Missing documentation. Yeah, I mean, a vague issue identified. I don't know. Like, so it just means…what is…what are they actually gonna review for? Are they gonna review my case? Are they reviewing to see if there was problem, I guess? Hm.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Well, what would you do from here? If anything?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. I don't know. That's the thing because it's such a vague message of like, hey, something maybe happened. We don't know and we're gonna kind of look into it. Are you looking into your process? Are you looking into my case? You know what I mean? I don't know. So if I had the time I would, but then for, for what, for which thing, you know, is this about a, is this about a a health? A I'm sorry, you know, a a health claim kind of thing? It's just a claim, right? So it's like I assume it would be, I, I would assume it would be a health claim. I, I'm sorry, I'm saying a comp what do we call that? You know what I mean? Like a, like a, a disability health claim thing? Ok. But I, but I guess I don't, I don't know, I wouldn't know. So you like, what do you look into? And I don't know what I'm looking for, you know, it would be more confusing, I think and I wouldn't know what to do.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. That's helpful. Ian, do you have any further questions with this one? No.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah, that, that covers it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, absolutely. All right. So based on what you actually already shared with us, I was going to ask if you ever scheduled an appointment at a VA facility and you said you have and that you've received email communication regarding those appointments, you actually provide us with a ton of really great information on that already. And so I think I'm gonna skip past like the sort of diving into questions about like what you were expecting because I think we covered that already. I unless there's anything you want to talk about before we show the email. No. Ok. So let's say you received this email about your appointment. And since you are familiar with getting the appointment reminders, I this might look a little different than the ones that you receive. But they're sort of working on the layout and design of these things. So, taking a look at this, are you provided with enough information?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. And just let me know when you need to scroll because there is there, there's, there's more at the bottom there.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. I like the current as of time and hack. That's a, that's a neat feature I suppose. I've always just assumed, you know, when you get the, the message, that's the sort of a current as of I'm sorry, what the wording would be last updated in this case. But yeah, so I like, I like so go ahead and scroll. Sorry.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Oh, yeah. Oh, there we go. Oh, sorry. It's scroll, scroll is a little, I've got a scroll wheel that's hyper sensitive and plus it's the, the, the zoom sharing thing.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. So I like the way I'm used to it now where the, in this regard where the, the most pertinent info is right up front, right, your date, your, you know, your appointment time and date and all that stuff is right up top or the dates, right? And then the, and then the other, sort of mandatory things that were in there. Like, I think it was Coronavirus came before this for some reason. It did. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, those kind before your appointment, all that stuff. I would want all that down. Maybe the only thing that I see here that would, I, I guess I'll give you the cut off line, the cut off line would be just before the, before your appointment. That's what I, I like that. All of that is after the list of upcoming appointments. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Gotcha. So you're saying gray boxes right before, before, before your appointment in between, like, right after that first paragraph.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Yeah, I'm ok with that first paragraph. Of course. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. And then have the gray boxes come right after that?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Yeah, I just want to look at the gray box and make sure I'm not missing something. So, I mean, it looks like it's, maybe the only thing would be, which type of appointment. But that, that gets funny too because, I mean, some of these, you know, I mean, there are lots of different appointments coming up and theoretically I've got them sorted but I mean, even if it's just like, Ortho labs, mental health and maybe these are things that we don't want in there, but I, I suspect some of that is indicated in current messaging or maybe I'm just inferring it and, and how would that, how would that information be helpful? Sorry, I guess, to remember like, what, what I'm going for, I guess I, I don't know what else to, how else to answer that. Like, there's a big difference in my mind, at least whether I'm, you know, whether my, you know, long awaited. Well, I finally got in with this specialist appointment is coming up versus a, I don't know some other routine thing that I've got going on or my annual, or reminder maybe that there are labs to do, you know, things like that and I understand that's all behind logging in. But then, you know, I'm just, again, there's my user experience. I want it now.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah. Yeah. No, that makes, makes a ton of sense. Totally. Get it.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Nothing else on that. Ok, cool.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Do you feel that, is there anything you feel in this message, might be unnecessary or out of place.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Not that we haven't already talked about.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. Ok, you want to move on to the next one, Ian, don't switch the screen yet, but I just wanted to check before. Ok, hands off.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. I didn't mean that I just met before we move on.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, so what about emails from the VA about something from your profile needs to be updated? Have you received anything like that?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. I don't recall would have been a couple of years ago probably. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Well, let's say that the va needs you to update or confirm an email address and you receive an email about that. You know, same, same question here. What kind of content or information would you want to have provided there?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Well, again, identify, I guess I haven't said it like that. It's the VA which has been consistent. So I take that for granted. But say that, I guess like you have contact info that needs confirmation or something. I don't really need the why, I guess and there's the, the link to do it. I'd like to know whether it's my address or phone number or something like that, but, but I'd probably not dismiss that even if it didn't have that specificity.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. Well, let's take a look at that email and give you a chance to look over it and let us know questions you might have if you know, if there's anything you would do from here, there's enough information, too much information.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. This is that there's a bit of specificity that I was asking for. So that's cool that there's a problem why it matters to me, right? Why it matters to the VA but why it matters to me. Oh, that's all there. And the link is there more to scroll or your mind? Oh, cool. It didn't. Yeah, I guess it would need potentially to be updated in multiple places, different addresses.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. And how do you feel about that?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. That it might have to be updated in different places? It seems a, a pain in the butt. However, I can empirically accept that some people might want it to be different for different reasons. I don't know that reason. But gosh, I want my address to be, I would want the default to be a universal correspondence address with the VA
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. But I think I actually like this email.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So what would you do from here?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. I click the link and confirm it or change it if needed. I know it didn't need changing. Then I, you know, take the next steps of figuring out how it was not delivered. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. I don't have anything further to ask about this one. Ian.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah. No, we're good. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Have you ever filed a notice of disagreement with the VA?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. No.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Then we're just gonna skip that one. Because it's pretty specific. All Right. This is our last one. Have you ever received an email from the VA regarding your VA life insurance?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Oh, heavens. Yes, I think I have.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. And do you recall any questions you might have had when you got the email?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Was there enough information? Is it what you expected?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. I don't recall. I'm sorry. No, that's totally fine.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Well, let's say that you made a change to your va life insurance and you got an email. What do you expect to see there a notification that they received a change?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Right? Because maybe I didn't. So that's important. Hey, there was a change. And then again, I understand they might not be able to say what the exact change was, but maybe an indication as to the nature of the change. Certainly, if it was the result of like a legal action, right? I would, I would wanna know that or an indicator for that. And of course, like I understand a lot of this will be behind the log in but you know when it happened, why it happened and what it is, right? Ok. That'll probably be behind the link.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Go ahead and take a peek at it. And so was this what you were expecting? Is there anything you would do from here? Is there more information with the leg?
1. **Participant 02:**
1. It just says you have new documents to review, which could be just an, I mean, often you know, we get bombarded with a lot of these things, this terms and conditions have changed or privacy agreements have changed or, and that's how I get, that's not what this is about, but it, or we recently processed a change to your VA life account. So I would want that to be right up front like I, like I told you initially. So I would want that to be, hey, there was a change, if it needs to be behind the log in, you know, which it ought to be. I'm sure you know, log in to check the change and if you didn't initiate this change, boom, that's a point.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. OK. It's, you're so good at like describing exactly what you're expecting to see in these. I love it. So then I think we could just be like we're done, Ian right one and done.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. We could, we could skip the, we could skip the rest of the week.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Do you have any more questions for him on this email type?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah. Oh I was just gonna say so. So you, you, you're saying that it would, it, it would be nice to, to know to, to have like you said, maybe not the, not the, the the details but a hint at the like the, the the area or, or like what the what or why? Like if they could parse whether it's just some, you know, the, the terms and conditions have changed or if it's, you know, like, you know, your deductible is now different or whatever.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Right. Yeah. Or, or certainly if it was a, if, if they think I requested the change, I want that upfront too. Right. Rather than a, what I would dub a bureaucratic or administrative behind the scenes change. Gotcha.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Right. Right. So two separate se separate emails. One to, to confirm or not, not separate. But like if it's one thing, call it that one thing if it's the other say the other but don't, but don't bulk them together.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. Yeah, or just yeah, be, I guess different. Yeah, be clear about what it is. Ok. And it's not just exactly, not just terms and conditions have changed but like there's a change in your, your, you know, your coverage, your address, you know, whatever it is like that matters that I, that I think I, I made or, or even if I didn't make it, I guess that's the other part I was getting at like if it was if my beneficiaries have been changed by court order or something like that, making this up as I go. So please don't do that.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. No. Rock and roll, man. You're doing great. We love it.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. That's something that I certainly need to know because that is very different from, you know, terms and conditions have changed.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Indeed.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Awesome. Love it. Thank you so much.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Well, hey, we are right up on time. I wanna give you a chance if there's anything that you'd like to share with us that we didn't cover today. No, no. All right. Well, hey, we really appreciate you taking time to share your thoughts with us and your feedback is invaluable as we continue to improve these email communications. So, thank you so much. It was nice chatting with you and enjoy the rest of your day.
1. **Participant 02:**
1. You too. Thanks.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah. Thank you so much for your time. Take care.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right, bye bye.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Awesome.
1. 
1. **Participant 03:** INTERVIEW
1. 
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. Well, just a few, get to know your questions. Can you tell us, what branch of the military you served in?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Air Force.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. And when did you retire or separate?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. May 1st 2013?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And since retiring or separating, have you, or do you currently receive emails from the VA?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Yes
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, great. Which ones do you any of that come to mind?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Like a title of it?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. No, just like a, like the category, like what it might be related to?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Oh, like those appointment reminders I get, I get some for like not appointments, like for the pharmacies. I get the survey ones, like for the feedback. Ok, I get it when, like I have the app, like on my phone. So like when I get, the message I'll like, say like, oh, you have a secure message to check, like to go in and check. So I get like a not here. I don't know. Does that count? Like for email? Like if you get the notification email, it doesn't say much just like you go in and check your message. Oh, my God,
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. That absolutely counts. Yep. Ok.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. So those, my, no, let me see. You gotta see me. Hello?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah, we can see you. Can you hear? Can you see us?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. I went into my emails.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Oh, no worries, no worries. Yeah, we're here.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Yeah that’ss about therapy. Sadness is message from providers. Like we have to be your questionnaire for VA screening. That's more like with this ones to all in.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, it sounds like like a wide variety.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Yeah
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. You're getting nicely communicated too about a lot of things from the VA. So that's cool. Can you tell us about the experience of receiving these emails?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Like like some of them are annoying because I don't give you anything.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. It's kind of like I think I put it in the trash. It was so like the ones with like the appointment reminders because that list like all the appointments like I have some of them like that's an open room. And you know, like that's an open, they started sending it like what even in September but it would have on there, I got not much trash. Like when it has on there like where the appointment is sometimes but then they won't have on there. Like what is like, I have one on the fifth like either on the sixth of November, then one on the seventh for November and then two different places cause I just moved here to like intake appointments, but I don't know which is which, well, we're 21 on the six turning seven. both of them are in the same place, but I will have to like, call in order to see like, oh, is this what I need to my appointment with my regular PCP or is this my appointment for, with like my psychiatrist or like it doesn't really say, yeah, it just sounds like your date. And because it's like intake, it just sounds like the location which is the main building and like I feel like a phone number or if you have a call and cancel and then it just goes on a list of the other ones whether you like video connect or something like that. But it doesn't really tell me like who I'm seeing or anything else. I just don't have an appointment on that day. She said I didn't really i it helps me out but it doesn't really give me all the information that I need. Is that, is that something that you would expect to have in the email or, or reminder? Yeah, like where I'm going because like I have other appointments there, like the endocrinology appointments or if I need like lab work and stuff like that cause this building is different for where I moved from. And so sometimes like when we moved from, they have different locations for different, like go to optometry. It's at a whole different location. So, if I know if it's on the, I know, oh, Indian is for the Deadness where Academy is for on the primary medical center and here's all of my building. So I don't know what I going to, what I'm going for. Because it just gives, like, the generic location.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Is that right? Ok.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Ok. So last time I just walked in and was like, hey, can put my name in and see where I'm supposed to go.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Ok, so that's the workaround. You have to show up, show up early just in case you have to walk to a different part of the building. Is that, is that how you? Ok.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. OK. I, I like to prepare for appointment cause some of them they last longer and other ones may take a little bit more mental preparation.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Sure, sure, sure.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. That makes total sense.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. So I don't like that part when they, I mean the emails help but that little piece of information would be helpful and I was trying to find it but I just put it in the trash and because I, and I, yeah, I should have it. I didn't think about.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Oh no, no, that's totally fine.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. No, and this is really good feedback. So yeah, this is, we know we know what they look like.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. We, we
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Did you make it?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. No, no, no, no, no, no.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. We did not. And even if we did, we'd still want you to, to trash it because we're here to improve it. Yeah, that's what, that's what we're trying to figure out is how to make them better. So, yeah, don't worry, don't worry about that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Well, so we're gonna go ahead and jump into like a part where kind of walk you through some scenarios and you tell us a bit of like what your expectation would be and then we will show you an example and then you provide feedback on that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So to get started, can you tell us about your experience receiving any debt related emails from the va I mean, it wasn't like a positive or negative.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. I mean, I didn't want to go but my insurance came because I don't know, I don't know if it was regarding something, but I think I have it sorted out because I don't know if it was like one of those emails that was like as everyone was using. So I think at first I was kinda frustrated. This is like paid, if it wasn’t paid or II, I forgot what it was, it was like a call us if you want to be part of this, this plan because it was getting pushed back and getting back to paid. But I don't think I had to pay in the beginning anyway. But since I received the email and notifications, I was like, oh, I didn't know I had, yeah, so I think it was just like one of those mass emails maybe that they send to everyone in the system. But then when I call, the number we got everything sorted out. But then I got another email when I actually did have the pay something and I just didn't know. So it was about ok, it was, I mean, it wasn't even that much but if I didn't get the email, I would have done nothing that I, and
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Can I clarify something that I'm hearing?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Just and correct me if I misheard. So, you've got one, like debt related email and you're like, I don't even know what this is about, but I've got, but you checked in on it and they're like, no, you don't know anything. Is that right? Is that what happened the first time? And then you got another one and did it just kind of feel super similar or was there a reason? Was it because maybe the first time you didn't have to anything? And so you got another one and that's why you didn't think that you owed the second time or am I mishearing this? I'm sorry.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Yeah. The first one was probably like a good one to where like, a lot of things was going on during the pandemic and I think they paused payment on like, a lot of people's things or either. Yeah, I think they post payments on people's stuff. But I did part of that. But then the second time I got a notification for debt, it didn't have anything to do with. The first one. It was just like, maybe I went and forgot to pay before I left the clinic. Just not knowing you gonna just set there. And they just emailed me. It was like, hey, you know, you have $6 over here and I'm like what like where this go like no, I didn't but I would have never known if I would have got like the email or anything so I don't think my address and stuff was updated and I just got the email and again I just called to see what was going on. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Lets see I'm gonna go ahead and we're gonna share an example of a a debt related email with you and let's say that you receive this email. Tell us what you think that it's trying to communicate with you and if there's any action that you would perform from this message and just, you know, take your time, look through it. And if you want go ahead and you know, if you wanna talk through it as you, you know, think out loud. Oh I don't know if you talking but I cant hear you.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Thank you.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah. Did you lose an ear bud?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Yeah, I forgot the name.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Oh Elissa. I'm sorry, it's not on here.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yes, I can, I can hear you really well, now it's a little bit harder to hear before.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So this is great. So, I don't know, whatever you did. Perfect.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Now I say at first sometimes when it's unless I see this little VA oh you can't see my mouse. Like with the blue ribbon sign of it sometimes I think it's spam. So I, I try to open it. So I like to see that because we had so much stuff from other place talking about all professional professional that sometimes I think it’s spam unless I see that on there. Sometimes he has a face that you please sign in. Sometimes, It's more of a stress out moment because the only thing you see is the debt part like, what do I owe the VA and that it's like, it's kind of like, what is it now? Like, I'm sorry, I wanna be stressed out in this moment or is there like, do I wanna deal with this? And so I think for me is like, either I'm gonna open it right then to see if I like have like my phone, like the app, is it or depending on the day I may just close the email and keep going because it's, I don't want to deal with it right now because it doesn't give a lot of information it gives just enough to put you in, more removed. And if you don't wanna be in that mood, right again, if you don't, depends on where I am in that moment, if I wanna deal with it. I also receive a statement. So when it's like, I'm like, I'll just like to get it in the mail. Like I'm, I'm not gonna be bothered if I don't need to be bothered. I'm already in debt with it. It's not good talking to you. So that's how I would take it first.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. What, what would you, what would you want or expect in an email like this?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. For debt? No, I don't want to get an email like that. If I could know, I guess where it came from like if I knew that it was right, a doctor visit or a pharmacy or X, right? Like if it had like the day of the visit because then in my mind I could be like, oh, that's where I went to the psychiatrist or? Oh, that's the dental appointment. Are they talking about where my glasses or I can bring back to remembrance? And it can like, tell me some of the anxiety that kind of comes with it because I know my glass are like, ok, I know that my insurance is gonna take care of half of that or disease side things. And I kinda know how that system works where I can prepare myself that me and my daughter talked about that sometimes when you go, they'll tell you like, hey, I wanna get a bill in the mail. Don't worry about it. This is what it is, but just seeing and I don't know where it's coming from and if I use multiple services, that's kind of hard to digest at one time when you have so many when we have some other things like completely at that time.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, that makes total sense. Well, let's say that this is the message you got. But let's say you receive this next email shortly after this first one. Tell us what your thoughts would be and what actions you would take if any.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. So the one, the one you, the one you just got is the one up top and then, and then you get this one in your inbox shortly after at the on the bottom.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. I think they sent me to the debt collection agency to get their money. I think about my credit report.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Oh, I'm so sorry.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. That's the first thing that comes to my mind.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Would you, would you would you would you assume that they are about the same thing or different things or I feel totally different.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. I think that the first one I'm dealing still with I VA it seems more so. But the second one seems like Debt Management Center got you and it doesn't really say anything like with the VA. I think of, like, a collection agency.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Gotcha
1. **Participant 03:**
1. That you turned me over to you. Like, they haven't tried to reach me. They haven't they? Like, that's why I think they're like two separate ones. Like the first one was a warning or he told me to contact you and then if I got this immediately after I'll think, like, you just sent me my warning letter and then you just send me over, like, to the people [debt collections] without anything else.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Right. Right. Right.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Are they the same?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. They, they are not one of them, one of them is for, copay, like a, a doctor's visit copay and the other is, for, it is a, it is a debt but it's not collections.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. It's just, if you, if you get overpaid for, benefits, like, sometimes, sometimes people have, dependents that, that age out, like they turn 18 and they no longer qualify as a dependent and veterans will get, will get a part of their benefits from that. And, sometimes if it's, you know, if they don't, if they don't keep their records current, they can get overpaid and got it.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Yeah. The second one seems more scarier than the first.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Understandable. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Good to know.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Cool. Good, good thing that these, these are just the sample ones. Right.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Is there anything else that you want us to know about? You know, if, if you would to have this scenario happen anything that might put your mind at ease, any additional information you'd want, a different way to be reached out to? Just throwing out ideas.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Like, if you can put, like maybe an example, like, kind of, I don't know how to pronounce per, is that your name? I thought that was the name of the study.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Oh, yeah. No. Perigean is the name of the company. Sorry? Yeah. you know what here? Let's change our names here. Yeah, I already, I'm gonna, I'm gonna rename myself. I'm so sorry.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. I apologize. They defaulted to Perigean
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. There we go. Yeah.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. So like can you explain like if I was to see the second one? Like an example of maybe what it mean? Like you have information available from that medicine center that may involve updating your dependence or updating. I know insurance or whatever. Like those updates look like, like I have a daughter, a big hair spouse or something like that to go in because sometimes we just forget our dependent status. And then like the same one like for a to clinic for managing the debt her. You have information for VHA, that may be in regards to, a visit within the past six months, you know, I don't know how you guys keep up with stuff and then at least I know like here in the past six months I know I went there for A, B and C or, within one of these centers by time. Dal, mental health, one of those facilities, she got me thinking just before I think it just eased the nerves and I would rather I give you a more to open it up sooner and try to get it taken care of and just having it simply because it, because it seems more mentally, feasible to do that, like I can get things sorted out. Ok, like just a P A plan.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, that makes sense.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Ian, do you have anything else? Oh my goodness. Any is there anything else you wanted to ask about this? Sorry, my smart speaker picked up.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. But did Alexa order you some, some something from Amazon? Now, was there anything I'm I'm
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So for the next email type we're going to talk about, can you tell us if you have any experience appealing a decision from the va regarding your benefits, for example?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. haven't appealed to benefits before I've had I just accept it.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Ok, thank you.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. I've used like the advocate message before like when I needed help with things. If that counts like with them, the advocate, the patient advocate, V advocates and stuff. Ok. Well, let's say they, they did come back with a decision and you decided you did want to appeal it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. And then you received an email about the decision. What do you, what would you expect to have in that email?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. I think I've had that, like, after they claim stuff with you, I've had those. How to appeal, where to appeal, the time frame, their decision why. All right, I would like the original, like not everything you originally submitted, but it looks like the things that you originally submitted, like I originally submitted duty form one, duty form two, duty form three, paperwork from this doctor, paperwork from this doctor doesn't have to be like the actual papers like because that would be a lot, but at least something explaining everything that I did submit because that's kind of hard when we don't get those back. And I'm like, well, because you cannot resubmit for re re evaluate the things that you already submitted. But then you're like, where did you stop? And so that gets kind of complicated to you when you're a bill in the process. So that would be nice to know, hey, these are the things we already evaluated that's in your plan that you can, that you can appeal on and the why. Cause I don't think that they list that now, at least in the last one that I received for mine, it wasn't listed like that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, well, let's say, you know, like, like we just mentioned that you appealed the decision the VA made about your benefits and they sent you this communication.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So we're gonna switch the screen to a new email. give me just a second.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. I got buried a couple windows deep here, accidentally clicked on the wrong thing. Ah, here we go. All right.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Take, look it over. Let us know what questions that you might have about this email and if there's anything you might do from here, that's when you really don't wanna talk to me.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. I would first say I don't know what it shortly means. Because your shortly might be different from mine shortly. So that will make me mad to check the status to check your appeal status or to visit the, the old, like the website. Mhm. That sucks because it's almost like they don't talk to each other and the, I don't know if it's like the site itself and it seems like they don't update one of the other still checking there. Even when you like put in something, it gets like frustrating at times cause either you're saying something totally different or, oh, here, like my, I think since the last time I updated like, except March for the longest, even though we're like, I submitted things in June and it took forever for it to update to the right me. So I was kind of like reading, that means why. And so when it keeps going down, like you're emailing and stuff, but then I can't submit anything via email. I can only see that stuff via mail. for a fact. Even though you're communicating with me through email, I can't respond back to email or actually talk to someone unless I have this VSO person or someone to talk for me. Yeah, it just seems like this run around but I'll still check the status and just probably go up to that the fact center and just like, OK, this is the email I got from me. What do we need to do from here and let them kind of work out for me? Cause they will have much more experience, then I will know what to do and try to decide for you everything. Yeah, that sounds frustrating.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, it really does. Is there anything else that you wanna share about this experience in particular? And I is there anything you want to cover before we move to the next one?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. No, no, I'm good. Yeah, we can, let's, we can move on to the next one.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. OK.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. We're gonna move on and look at another email type and let's say you submitted a document to the VA and something went wrong like on the back end of things, for example, like a system error that caused the document you submitted to not be filed and then you received an email. What would you expect that email to include?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. I guess what you just said? OK. All, hey, we had technical issues. I can see where since maybe attempted to upload a required document. Our system couldn't process it. We'll need you to upload it again. I rather have that than just saying, hey, we're permission these documents. Can you do it? Because in my mind I'm like, no, I uploaded, I uploaded that. I think we're, you just let me know like, oh something that just went wrong. It wasn't my fault. Was it any of your fault? It's just a computer glitch. I'll be happy to like go in and try to get what it needs to be done and like you should let me know like I'm not gonna get analyzed for what's going on. So I think again, it puts you back in that stress mode. It's like, hey, we're missing these documents. These required documents are supposed to be uploaded. And it's like, well, I, I get that because I know I'm on this deadline. It is time for him to get things changed and I ain't tell him he's not there. Yeah, I think if I was seeing something like, hey, we had a system crash in between no October 20th to the 23rd and we couldn't download any transfers during that time. Sorry for the inconvenience. If you could go back and do this, if you have these deadlines, you won't be penalized. We extended this date. Can you upload?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. So I'm gonna, we're gonna share an email with a similar situation and just give it a look over, let us know if you're provided enough information, what questions you might have about it?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. I think I’d be fine with that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, great. And any more questions you wanna cover on this one? All right, we can move on to the next one. And I already know the answer to this. I know that you've scheduled appointments with the VA because you mentioned at the beginning, and you told us about the type of email communications that you get regarding the appointment, and sort of some of the, you know, frustrations and things that go along with those curious about the cadence, like how often the appointment reminders are being sent out. Does it feel appropriate? Do you wish there was more?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. I'm not sure. I like you guys piling that right now. So it used to be like all the time and now it's some. So I was like, I wonder how you're doing something with it right now?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. So the cadence now changed?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Yeah. Ok. Yeah, my appointments haven't changed that much but the cadence of the frequency has changed. Ok. Recently, unless there's like something I changed the notification or something, but I don't remember changing anything like that. Has it changed for the better or did you like it the way it was before and I think it changed for better before it was just too much. Oh, yeah, because I already have to act like you go in and look and then it'll send stuff in the mail too and then you will get the email, too and it was just, it was a lot. Yeah, it just became like, oh, my gosh, it does. Yeah. Ok. But now it's not as much. I like it when it's for, you know, maybe two weeks out that if you need to wake out just so you like old two weeks if you're still planning things that's still in your foresight. But then again, when it gets much close, just while you're like, all right tomorrow or at the beginning of the week when you're planning stuff, you know, just don't appear for a week with that in here. But it used to be like your whole thing because like I said, I got to start things of Sein for November and then like almost every week and I'm like, I don't even have anything for the next two weeks and you're reminding me for stuff. That kinda annoying. I understand. Like when I first made the appointment that they would send me something because I just made, that's just what they do like all, but after that, wait a little bit closer. So the appointment is in.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Well, let's take a look at this appointment email you received it about your appointment. Also if it's not a view that you're familiar with looking at, just know that the current version might look a little different than what we're showing you right now. But take a look, let us know if you're like, you have any questions about this message, were you provided with enough information? Is there anything that you might find confusing about what you're presented with here and just let me know when you need me to scroll.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. It's a long one.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Well, you can scroll. Are the, are the numbers just the generic numbers to the clinic as a whole or does that give you the, the number to the clinic that you went to?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. What would you want it to do?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. The clinic that I'm going to.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Ok. But sometimes it just takes you back to the appointment line.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. And the confirm just means that the appointment I confirm that it's coming. But then sometimes maybe it's just me, like it would say like that the appointment was canceled but it wasn't me that canceled the appointment or it doesn't say like reschedule anything. Like if I show up my doctor wasn't there and then I'll just put cancel on there. Would there be cancel on my part? And I was like I did all mine. So I didn't know if like there were other choices. But I mean, the same, like the medical center. I don't know this one. It's like if it was under there it's like a halfway your department that you're, you're going to all, or maybe your doctor, if you know when your doctor is, sometimes it will have like first floor, second floor, every now and again but not all things it has that. Yeah. Can you scroll up? Thank you. Mm. And then like for, I got a test before your appointment. Call me to validate the daytime and checkup appointment. Can I just be in the little box where it has like your upcoming video or in-person appointment? Like what type it is? Like the video or in person telephone instead of, I mean you could still call ‘em to be sure. But if it could be like, I know somewhere in the status or location like in a little box down there. What type it is?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, that's a really good idea.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Yes.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. P3, we are at time, Ian and I have time but we wanna be really respectful and mindful of your time. Do you want to continue or do you need to wrap?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Yeah, it doesn't matter.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. You have some time? Ok.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Sure.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Oh, thank you so much. Like I'm so glad your feedback has been really amazing.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So thank you.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah, we know we know you only signed up for 45 minutes but if you're with us, we're excited about it. We promise, we promise we won't go too much longer. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, we can actually, if, if there's, if you have any, any other feedback on this one in particular, we can move on to the next, if not.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Ok. No, that was one of the big things. This one, everything is nice. Ok, great.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Have you ever received an email from the VA that something in your va profile needs to be updated? Yes. Emphatically. Yes. Huh. Ok. I don't know when the last time you got one of those were, but if, if for some reason one is standing out in your mind, was there any questions that you had when you got the email? And were you provided with enough information in that message? It's ok if you don't remember too.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. No, I think so. I think when I got it, like it actually told me like, what I need is like you need to go in and upload like your data separation for changes, update your aid or something like that. Like one of them I know is very specific and I was like, oh, ok. I thought I did this though. I didn't have to, one of them. I know I didn't have to figure out anything else. All right, let me just get my papers together before I even log in start everything ready to like take pictures of and upload it. All right. So another one that was a while ago, I think there's potential one. when I logged in some time ago, I tell you that I update it, but most of them I just try to update as I go. But, but once I did receive it, I don't think I had, trouble knowing like where to go and what you need. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Well, in this scenario, let's say the VA needs you to update or confirm your email address and you receive, I'm sorry, your mailing address and you receive this email. What type of questions might you have? And is there anything you can do from here?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Before we scroll down, I would say that, I like how you put what you used the address for. Because I changed my address and I'm actually trying to do this now too. Because I didn't know that just because you change it. Like maybe when VHA or VA H doesn't necessarily change it with VSO and stuff like that. And, so I like that you can put like, hey, when you change it here, these are the things that it will impact. So I don't know if you can put in your, like, you may still need to change with the veteran service office or this veteran's office is like, my medicine is still getting shipped to my old address. I just recently moved like the past 2-3 months. But all of my other things for my medical is going here in North Carolina. Even though I updated my address in the VA system because all the systems doesn't connect and it, and I didn't know that when I was getting my mail. So that's very useful to know when I update it here, all the things that will be updated. So I do like those bullet points like I said, I didn't know that as soon as I update my address, like I did update my address like what it's right here. I'm looking at it. So I do like that with that one. Yeah, yeah. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Any details that you expected to see here that you're not seeing or feel pretty much what you were expecting, pretty much what I was expecting to tell me what to do, how to do it, where to go to.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Ok, I think that's what I like. I think that's what most people like it to break it down to where simple. Not that we’re stupid but we just wanted you to get to the point and let us know so we can do it without trying to go through a lot of hassle. Got it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Ian was there anything else you wanted to cover on this one?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah, no I you mentioned you mentioned the great that they show you how like what, you know, what area is this address changing this, this, this profile would cover. Do you, do you have a sense of, of the areas that it doesn't cover or?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. I, like, I can't think of anything like you mentioned prescriptions and, and, and VSO are there any other, any other places at the VA you might, you might think to update your, your email address or your, your contact information?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. No, that come to mind and no, it is a totally acceptable answer.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. I'm trying to think of what I had to, I knew I had to do different places or how to go to, each one of my hospitals, like when I was going to Colorado, I don't know if the pharmacy was different. Rocky Mountain was different from Kearney school. So each one of those I have to change addresses for, I heard from my medical records, but I didn't know that and give my medicines. Even though I changed it in the baby dot gov, there's still sent to different places. And I'm not sure how that was fixed. I just told my doctors and they went in ok and fix it. So it's nothing that I did. When I did my claim and transferred over the island to, huh, North Carolina Goer County Veterans, Center. Yeah, I filled out there and then they changed my address in the system so that other people to the other. So the claims people can see even though I had been inside, I did it like the, the ID me and I had already changed it but they wasn't still see it in the system. But once I filled out the form there and then, talk back with some of the eight people and a car, you, it took about a week or so. But that's when they start seeing it too. And I think it was the guy that, that told me that I was asked by three different departments like the health benefits, the services, but I forgot the other one, but you actually have to update in different places because they're not, they're connected but not connected. Right? That sounds frustrating.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah, it sounds complicated too.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. So I found that being very helpful to know like once I do this, these are the things that I can kind of a little too fine to not have to worry about doing things. I actually work with someone with the VRD right now as he had all of my correct stuff. Which is good because it was just something else I didn't have to worry about and all the stuff I didn't have to take. So that was better.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Cool, thanks.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Alright. This next one is a little niche. So if it's not something that applies to you, we'll move on to the next one. But have you ever filed a notice of disagreement with the va I don't think so.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Ok. All right, we'll skip that, that one then.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Let's see here. Ok. This is our last one. Have you ever received an email from the VA about your va life insurance?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Yeah, a lot. All right. You wanna tell us about what you might recall about that experience?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. And again, that's fine. If you don't recall, nothing stands out.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Yeah, I'm not, I'm not sure we're not sure that I can really take that sling even though I should just. Yeah. No, that's, that's exactly what we were hoping for so.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, well, if you did get something from the va let's you know, what would you about your va life insurance, what kind of content or information would you expect those emails to include, what benefits my family?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. What, what depends? Ok. Yeah, it'll be more of how we'll be able to help them that would probably get my attention. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right, let's say that you made a change to your life insurance with the VA and then you receive this email, you know, read through it, same, same deal as the other ones, let us know what kind of questions you might have. And if there's anything that you would do from here.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. I probably go check it out and read it. It looks like the same one for you. Yeah, I would probably log in to.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All Right. Is there any information that you, would want to contain in here? That's not here or does it feel appropriate?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. My first thought of that is probably just some generic. Like, you guys are probably updating some type of policy that you have to tell us about. Oh, yeah. Like, It doesn't pose any threat to me, so I'll just open it. Scroll down and press the link.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. No.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yup.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. And, it seems harmless. I probably should read it. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Fair.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yep. Yep. Yep. Every time, right. Scroll. Agree. Where, where's the button?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Right?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah, we all do it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. And before we wrap, is there anything else that you wanted to ask?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah. No, no, we're good. We're good. This was awesome, P3, is there anything that you want to ask, or, or anything additional that you might want to share with us today before we wrap the call?
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Mm. Not that I can think of. Ok. Well, we really appreciate you taking the time, to spend your morning with us and share your feedback and thoughts with us.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. It's gonna be really helpful as we continue to really try and improve on these email communications from the VA so thank you so much and enjoy the rest of your day.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. Thank you too. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Thank you so much. Have a good one.
1. **Participant 03:**
1. You too. Bye bye bye.
1. 
1. **Participant 04:** INTERVIEW
1. 
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right, great. Well, just a little, get to know you. One, can you tell us, what branch of the military?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Army.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And when did you retire or separate?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. 2015.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And since retiring or separating, do you receive emails from the VA?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Yes. Lots, lots.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. You, do you, recall which ones? It doesn't have to be a full list but are just do any stand out to you.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. I get the VA directors suite something email, just like a general information, email and then I get a prescription notifications that they've sent, secure messaging if I get a message or something, gives me an email, couple other things. But, yeah, I get just some random emails from him about this or that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Can you tell us, like what your experience has been receiving emails from the VA, ok.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. They're a little inconsistent. Like how, like, the prescription updates, like maybe I don't know, eight out of 10 times they'll send it. But then for some reason, sometimes they just don't send anything at all or I won't get an email saying it's already been shipped. Or whatever?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. That is interesting.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. It's kind of like that with it. Yeah, it's kind of like that with a lot of things is like, you know, they email, email, email and all of a sudden nothing. Then the email, email, email. I'm not sure why they do that. But
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Does it seem like it's a certain type of messaging or is it just in general?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Just in general because they do it on the prescription updates and the secure messaging updates and stuff. It's like most of the time I'll get the emails and then all of a sudden I'll get nothing and then, you know, I could tell because the prescription shows up and they haven't usually, they'll send two or three emails saying your prescription is shipped, your prescription is shipped and then got it and then nothing and then nothing. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. In an ideal world, like how would you prefer the VA communicate with you, for example, email, text messaging letters?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. I, I prefer the email just cause it's a lot easier to not ignore. But when they, when they want to get a point across like for appointment updates, I get those too. They have a tendency to send 234 emails about the same thing. And I really don't feel like getting that many text messages and that many letters in the mail about the same thing over and over again. So an email, it's easy to just kind of like, yeah. Ok, it's there. Ok. I'll look at it later, kind of get to it when you can get to it. Yeah, because generally speaking, it's really not super important stuff. So it's ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Well, we're gonna like, go ahead and get started with a few scenarios here and we're gonna walk through, in this session. Examples of different types of mail communication that's being sent from the va and just kind of check in with you about like what your expectations would be for that and, and that kind of stuff so to get started. Can you tell me about your experience receiving debt related emails from the VA I've never gotten a debt related email from the VA. Ok. All right. If you did, what would you expect that email medication to contain?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Probably first would be a point of contact to find out why there's a debt and that basically just some who I'm supposed to talk to to get a get this all taken care of because I really wouldn't want them send in personal information and everything listed in that email.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Well, let's say that you receive this email and Ian's gonna share his screen with you. Let us know if it's, if you're able to see that.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Yeah, I see it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, great. Take a second to look through it sort of think out loud as you do. And tell us what you think this email is about and is there anything that you would do from here?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Probably click on the link and try to figure out what it's about because it really doesn't say a lot. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. If, if you had to take a wild guess, what would you guess it's about? It's ok if you don't know.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Some kind of, I mean, some kind of debt but or they think that I owe them something.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Ok, I would definitely look at it, find out.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, you definitely click on the link and dig into it?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Mhm. Yes.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. So like let's say that you've received an email shortly after this one?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Oh, Elissa, I just have a quick before we, before we move on.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. I just have a a tiny quick question. I just want to dig into you mentioned that you wouldn't want all all the information in the email, all the details and email. When you saw this, you said there's not much here. Can you tell us sort of which side of the fence you would want the informa? Like how, how much like what are the things you want in this email and what are the things you don't want? It's you know, as as specific as you can get, you know, like what sort of details
1. **Participant 04:**
1. I think this information that that's in this email is fine.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. I didn't really, it was kind of hard to read that manage VA debt when I first saw it. But I mean this is, I mean I, I can't really think of much else to add to it because I mean I wouldn't want personal details saying, oh well you owe this debt or whatever in here.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. I'm not you don't want, you don't want the amounts you don't want anything like that. Ok cool thank you.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Yeah it's yeah I can't think of anything else to really add because it's, I mean, I assume that they would have all the information on whatever this link is.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Cool. Ok, great. All right, sorry, go ahead. No, that's, it was a really good, good point Ian, I'm glad you called that out.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So you've received this email and then shortly after that, this first one you get this next one. it's gonna be the one right below what Ian is sharing here. What are your thoughts and what actions would you take if any?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. And I click on the link and I guess one thing maybe they could add, which I don't know if they really would is like a point of con contact phone number to call somebody at the VA directly. So because I don't, I'm not a particular fan of doing everything online, but they kind of make it that way sometimes.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, so when we're looking at both of these messages, are they, do you think they're telling you the same thing once or they trying to indicate something different. What are your thoughts on the two of them?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. They're basically the same, but the second one kind of is more direct and saying because it says Debt Management Center and not just VA administration, it's kind of more to the point. OK. I think it's, I think it stands out a little bit more so you know, that it's important because it says debt management like right there. So you can, and that's usually something that's cause for alarm and to actually look at. Yeah, for sure.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ian, do you wanna sort of break the fourth wall on this and sort of tell Christos what these are about and then we can see if, if they're still meeting the needs. Yeah, absolutely intended to.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Ok. Yeah. So the, so the first one is, is you, you'll receive, you would receive that if you had a copay for an appointment that was, that was outstanding. The second one is an overpayment on benefits. Like for example, let's say you had a, a dependent who, who, turned 19 and, and was, you know, no longer eligible to be listed as a dependent, but the, the va didn't know it and they, they overpaid you and then found out, does that change, does that change anything about what you'd, what you'd expect, to see in these emails or what you would want to have in these emails.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. No, I mean, I, I would, like I said, I would assume that, you know, when you go on the link and they would have it in your, your sign on that, you know, this is what you owe and this is the problem and this is where you need to take, get it taken care of cause that, I mean, I don't know, I think it's, to me it looks like the same thing, just the bottom one has Debt Management center in there. But I would think that both, I think both of them come from like both scenarios would come from the same office.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So having said that the, I know that you mentioned that the Debt Management Center being in the message sort of was a cause for alarm or action or that you would feel more like the need to investigate this and see what's going on. Yeah. Would you feel that it now that you know what the top one is, would you feel that that would also require that you'd want to see debt management center in that message as well? Or does it feel appropriate that it's only in one?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. I think they should be in both of them. It just, just because generally, you know, when I usually get the emails on my phone and when it, and when it pops up on my phone is the email, it'll show the header, you know, you have information available from the Veterans Health Administration. That would be kind of like. Oh, yeah. Ok. Whatever, I'll get to that when I get to it. But you know, the first line is you have information of mail, you have information from the Debt Management Center. That's a little more urgency of maybe I had to look at this right now and gotcha.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, that makes sense for sure. Before we move on to the next one, is there anything else you wanted to ask, Ian?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Oh no, we're good.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, and P4 before we move on. Is there anything else that you wanted to talk about or share with us about the the debt related emails that we're just talked about?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. No, not on this screen. No.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. For the next email type that we're gonna talk about. Can you tell us if you have any experience appealing a decision from the va regarding your benefits? For example.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. No, I've never had to do that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Well, let's do an imaginary scenario where you did you appealed a decision that the VA made about your benefits and then you received an email communication about it. What type of questions or sorry, what type of information would you want that email to have?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Maybe a brief, a brief summary of why it was, are you talking about like a, like the rejected appeal or just in general a decision on the appeal. Yeah. Well, I would expect mostly at least have what the decision is in a brief, if it's, if it's a, a negative, then a brief summary of why and again, a point of contact of who I can talk to the, do whatever I have to do, say whatever I have to say to them.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. Well, let's say that you got this email. Take a minute to look it over. I think out loud as you sort of work your way through it and, you know, let us know if anything is confusing or if things seem to make sense, if there's anything that you wish that you had here, things like that.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Right. It doesn't really, I'm reading it wrong. It doesn't really say what the decision is. So I guess you would have to click it and go online to find out what the final decision was.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. What are your thoughts on that?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. I think it's a little safer not to people, put people's personal information on there. I mean, this would be fine because it has, you know, you can go online and look at it or you can call, the number.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. So do you feel like this is providing you with enough information?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Yes.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Is there anything in here that is, you feel like might be out of place? Or does it all feel like relevant if, I mean, everything seems relevant?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. It, yeah. And this seems, this seems fine because they're probably gonna mail you 10 things to go along with this in the mail too. Ok. But I don't see anything that's really missing or anything from it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. So to sort of go back to what we had talked about before you saw the example, you had mentioned that you'd wanna see what the appeal was. Do you feel like now that you've seen it, you are sort of switching your gears on like whether that was appropriate for the email or would you maybe still wanna see it here or I just wanna clarify.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. I mean, I'd like to see it here but it's, it's not like they're making it difficult to see.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Yeah,
1. **Participant 04:**
1. I mean, even if it's, even if it's just like a one word sentence, you know, your, your appeal was approved or denied, I mean, you don't have to list the exact reasons, I guess, but you know, they make it easy enough to go and look and I would assume that that would have the link would have the information that the in depth, you know, stuff from it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Ian? Anything further you wanna talk about on this one? No, P4, anything further you wanna discuss on this one? All right. So we're gonna move on and take a look at another email. Type. But first let me sort of level set about what it's about. So let's say that you submitted a document to the va and something went wrong on the back end. And like, for example, like a system error and it caused the document that you had submitted to not be filed. And you receive an email about that, what kind of details would you want or expect that email to include?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Mostly just there's a problem. For some reason, the document tried to upload did not, and we need to try this again because I've, I've went through this before them, but I never got any kind of email or anything.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok
1. **Participant 04:**
1. I was, I was trying to submit MRI S and MRI reports to them and it took about nine tries to finally get it in my medical records, but I never got any kind of email.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. That sounds frustrating.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Oh yeah. And I said I never got any kind of email or anything but, and they actually never said anything. I would send it and it got sent by the doctor that did the emails and they sent it to the VA and didn't hear anything. Then I called them like, ok, where's this stuff? Oh, it must have not went through do it again.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Let's say if they, they, we did send or we, if the VA sent an email about that failure, what would you hope that that message would include just that, you know, the document you were trying you were trying to submit, didn't go through.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. And I guess first, just let me know there is a problem and second, probably a phone number of some sort to talk to somebody to get it taken care of and it needs to be, you know, have somebody walk you through it to make sure that it gets in there. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Well, let's say this is the email that you do receive. Take a moment. This is pretty lengthy. I believe there is a scroll on this one. So if you wanna let Ian know when you get to that point for him to scroll.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Ok. And let's see, I'm at the bottom now.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Oh, gotcha. Mm. Ok. It's kind of a kind of a vague letter just doesn't really, I mean, it says you failed to establish a claim but it says no action needs to be taken at this time. It's kind of kind of vague. I'd probably most likely have to call somebody about this one.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. And is, is there anywhere on here that you might find where to do that or who to reach out to?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Well, they have a whole lot of, they got a whole lot of links down here. I mean, I'm more, more than likely, probably just call the 1 800 number. It's kind of, you know, the way it's worded. They say, well, you don't need to take any action but there's a problem with your claim is what they're basically telling you. Just kinda, and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't just sit there and go. Ok. I guess they'll take care of it.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Right. What, what information would, would, would make it feel less vague or what's, what's, what's missing in, in your mind.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. I mean, exactly what they're doing. It's just kind of, it's just kind of like they say, well, something might have happened. I mean, I, I think they really on this, they should probably take out that no action is needed and at least tell you to call in and find out exactly what's going on and talk to somebody instead of just saying no action is needed because this kind of, kind of sounds like there's some action needed.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. That's fair.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. And what are your thoughts on the, all of the ways, to contact us, not us, the VA, but it says contact us. Sorry, I was reading it.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Oh, they, there's, there's a lot of them on here. I mean, really, I, the, the whole male thing that's, I probably emphasize either doing the call or contacting the VSO because doing it by mail will take you about six months to a year to even get them to look at it. Ok. They have a, they have a lot of, they seem to have a lot of links to people to talk to, which kind of goes against the thing of no action is needed, but they have a whole lot of resources for you to actually talk to about it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, thats fair.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Do you feel like there are certain ones that you'd want to utilize for certain questions you might have or would it, do you, the phone number would just be like basically all you, you think you'd need that in the VSO?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Yeah, the phone number and the VSO would be the top two. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Sorry, go ahead.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. I just found that doing things through the regional office and mail and everything else with the VA takes a long, long time.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. I, do you have any further questions on this one?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. No, no, we're, we're good.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, and P4 you good to move on or is there anything else you want to share?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. No, I'm fine with that. Ok. Excuse me, you're fine.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So I'm guessing that the answer is yes, but have you ever scheduled an appointment at a VA facility?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Yes.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. And when you did that, did you receive any type of email communication regarding the appointment?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Usually about a week before the appointment? They'll send me the email point appointment reminders, they'll start sending them and they'll usually send about a week prior, they'll send one a day for about four or five days. You have an appointment, you have an appointment. You have an appointment.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. The squeaky wheel? Mhm.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Yeah. Done. Speaking of that. And if there's one thing about those emails is they always seem to want to send them around one or two o'clock in the morning.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Oh, interesting.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Always get, I mean, I usually keep my phone on off in a distance at night and it's always about one or two o'clock in the morning. I'll hear it go off and it's an appointment reminder. Oh, I've always wondered about that. Why, why one or two o'clock in the morning
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. P4, out of curiosity. Where are you located in the US?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Texas
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. I'm just trying to, that. I mean, yeah, just for our records because that's kind of a strange time. I was just curious.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. It's just, it's when I get him it like one or two o'clock in the morning, all your t, and I'm like, I look at it and it's like, why would you? Yeah, I know you're gonna send appointment reminders. But, jeez.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Hm. Yeah. So when you do get these, I mean, probably not looking at them at one or two in the morning, but when you do look at them, do you, does it feel like all the information you need is in that message or were there any questions that you had?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Not usually. They just tell you, you know, your appointments here, there's the building number or, you know, office number, whatever and, and they're all the same email every time.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Well, let's say that you receive this email about your appointment. And it might look different than the current version that you get. But just for the sake of the, like our study right now, this is what we're looking at. Take a minute to look through it. And again, this one also has a long scroll. So if you wanna let Ian know when you want him to scroll, and just sort of think out loud as you go through and tell us what you're seeing and if anything feels out of place or if you wish there was more information on something, things like that.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. You see, everything seems to be pretty standard on here. That's all, what's, down at the bottom now everything looks pretty standard. The only thing I wish they would, I wish they would add in this is, in general on the emails is like, you know, if I have a doctor appointment, whatever, about a week before they'll have me do labs and stuff and some of them are fasting, some of them aren't fasting labs but they never, they never put that kind of information in there. Like, you know, should you fast or don't fast. Usually have to call them. Usually I have to call them and find out if this a fasting lab or they don't really include those kind of details in it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, I could see where that would be very helpful. You need a little bit of time to do the fasting. So.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Well, it's just good. Yeah, good to know in advance. Yeah, for sure.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. I mean, and do you have any questions about this one? No. And P4 you good with moving forward as well?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Yes, I'm good. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Have you ever received an email from the va that something on your va profile needs to be updated?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Yeah, actually a couple of years ago I think.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And what was the experience like with that?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. I just went into, yeah, my healthy vet and updated what they wanted updated. I think it was mostly contact information because I had moved and I changed my address and for some reason they said you need to change it and some other place on there too, like I changed it with the pharmacy or whatever and then I had to change it for something else too. I can't even remember. It was a couple years ago.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And when you received the email for that, did it feel like the descriptive enough? Like you knew what it was about and knew what you needed to do?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. I mean, I knew generally what it was about, it was something, you know, on the profile, but it didn't mention anything about what had to be changed, just said you need to update something in your, your profile and I went on there and it has like little red things, they update this, update this and
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, well, let's say that… Well, first of all, what would you, it, it did it, so you said it felt like it, it met your expectations. Like what kind of information would you want to have in it, in the message?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. I mean, the profile just, you know, your profile information needs to be updated. Maybe it's the key bullet point of what needs to be updated and here's the link or you, here's the link to go change that or here's where you, here's the link or here's where you need to go to change that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. Well, let's take a look at one of these emails and, you know, again, like we've done for the other ones, look through it. Tell us any questions that you might have what the top line looks exactly like when you sign on to the pharmacy and my health event.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. It does the same thing, confirm your, confirm your mailing address on file even though it already is. But that's exact like same thing it says every time you sign in. Oh, I didn't know that or it does with mine. I know the address is fine. But yeah, I see that all the time.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. I have a, I have a random follow up question about that when it says when it says that to you, does it, does it show your email address when it's asking you to confirm it or?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Oh, this one's mailing address
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. On the mailing address.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. No, it doesn't. It's just, when I sign on to my pharmacy, you know, renew my prescriptions or whatever, when I sign on it says that confirm your mailing address is on file with the va it says that every time in a couple of times I went and looked just to make sure that something didn't go wrong and it's always the same. I still always get my medicine and stuff. But, yeah, it always says that. Gotcha. Which would probably make me if I got an email like this, I probably, I don't know how much attention or urgency I would have because I do see that all the time. I don't know if anybody else does, but it always seems to say that online.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Gotcha. So, so the fact that they always say it makes you just go, ah, this is not anything I need to pay attention to.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Kind of. Yeah, because it's like, I don't know. So they send so many emails and so many this and so many that sometimes it's like, are they serious this time or is it just a general sending it to everybody that they like to do or?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Gotcha.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Yeah. I mean, everything else, everything seems in place on this. I mean, it has instructions how to do it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. I, anything further on this one? Yeah, I know. P4. Good to move on.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. I don't know if, or it says Dear Veteran.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. I don't know. I don't know if they're gonna, if they put like your name in there or if it's just like a form letter that says Dear Veteran. But, yeah, usually when I see that Dear Veteran I pay a little less attention because that's what they put on the mass mailers that they do to everybody. Like, I mean, if it is, I don't know if it is, but if it's more like personalized with your name saying, yeah, this is an issue for you. It would probably make you pay a little more attention. Yep.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yep. That makes sense.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Mhm. I think that's all I have for that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. Sounds good. This next one is a little bit of like a, a niche type of email. So if it's not something that you've, interacted with, we'll probably just move on to the next one. But have you ever filed a notice of disagreement with the VA?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. No. Ok. I had no idea. You could even do that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Well, then we'll go ahead and move on. And this is our last one. So, for the last one we're gonna be talking about VA Life insurance. Have you ever received an email from VA Life Insurance?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. I don't know if, if I ever got them directly from them, I've got the emails, the kind of newsletter I know it's had stuff about insurance in there, but I don't think I've ever gotten anything directly from the VA life insurance.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So let's say that you get something from VA Life insurance that you made a change to something in your insurance. And then you receive this email. What would you expect? That message to have that I've made a change to it.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Mhm. Yep. I would just probably expect them to say yeah, you know, recently you've made a change if, if you made the change and you know about the change then disregard if you didn't make a change, then contact this number immediately. And ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Well, let's say that you get this message. Oh, that's the notice of disagreement. Ian Can we go?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Oh my gosh. I'm sorry. Yep. We're skipping that one. We're skipping that one. Here we go. Sorry.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So in this situation you actually have something you need to review. Tell us your thoughts or if you have any questions on this one, I think this one is actually pretty good.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. I mean, it says you've made a change and if you, if you didn't do this, then yeah, call this quickly and it has a point of contact number and if you need to review whatever you click on the link, I mean, I'm assuming that it's anything that doesn't have to be signed or anything. It's just a copy of whatever you changed.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. Any, any other questions on this one, Ian, before we move on? No, we're good. All right. I think we have about three minutes left. Ian. Did you wanna ask the?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Oh, yeah. So this is, this is kind of a weird one. but it's a fun one. I promise. We kind, seeing everything you've seen today and, you know, in all of your experience and sort of ignoring, ignoring what's what's possible, you know, et cetera if we gave you a magic wand and there was one thing you could just wave this wand and it would change about how the, the va communicates with you via email. What would that one thing be?
1. **Participant 04:**
1. I just, I would say better consistency, make them more consistent where they send it every time instead of, you know, I don't know if they're having system updates or something. I don't know why they do it. But yeah, it's like every fourth or fifth time you're supposed to get an email from them. You don't, I don't know why.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So consistency in regards to the cadence of how frequent you're getting messaging or, or just getting them in general, just getting them in general, just getting everything that I'm supposed to get.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Ok, cool, cool.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Well, before we wrap, is there anything that you wanna share with us P4? Before that we didn't already cover, I don't think so.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. I mean, the only, the only really bad thing about them is when they send emails at one or two in the morning. Other than that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, that's totally fair.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. It's weird.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. We will, we will, we will put that in our write up promise.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Well, hey, we really appreciate you taking time to share your thoughts with us today. So it's just know that your feedback is so helpful for us as we continue to improve email communications from the va. Thank you so much and enjoy the rest of your day. You too.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. Thank you. All right, thanks P4.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Take care.
1. **Participant 04:**
1. You too. Bye bye.
1. 
1. **Participant 05:** INTERVIEW
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Just a few, just a couple of more questions. Can you tell me what branch of the military you served in Air force? Awesome, cool. when did you, retire or separate?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. I believe it was 2009.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Nice. Ok, cool. Since retiring or separating, have you, or do you current, have you in the past or do you currently receive emails from the VA? Yes. Awesome. Great. Can you, can you tell me about sort of the, the ones that sort of surface in your mind? Like the ones that the ones that come to mind, you mean from the, the VA specifically? Yeah. Yeah. Just, I mean, like, like educational medical admin burial, what, you know, whatever, you know, there's, there's a, there's a whole host of, of emails the VA sends out and we're just wondering which, which ones are, are, are coming across your inbox.
1. **Participant 05:**
1. Well, I guess I get, I get the Veteran Benefits newsletter, the VA news. Mhm. Newsletter and then get stuff about medical appointments. Right. I think I got stuff about claims but I haven't had any, our claims since like, 2018. Ok. And then I guess recently I've, I've had some emails from VRE. Ok, cool, cool, cool.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. And, and like on balance, what do you like? Do you, how do you feel about those emails? Are they, are they appropriate? Do they work for you? Is it too much? Too little? Is it, you know, what's your, what's your experience there?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. I think it's enough information.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. Ok, great, great, great. Ok, so, we'll dig in. We're gonna basically the, what we're gonna do is we're gonna show you a series of different types of emails and sort of, you know, construct scenarios around those and just get, get your ideas about, the kind and types of information you want in those emails. And whether you know what we're looking for also looking for is to see if, if it's different between types of, of emails, right? So to get started, have you ever had, an experience with, like, have you ever been sent a debt and debt email? Yes. Ok. Ok. can you tell me a little bit about that?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. It was an overpayment, I guess most recently. Well, well, I guess, no, I guess that was an email that was just a normal letter. Ok. For email, I think I had a debt from when I was, discharged. They overpaid me and they, they sent me like the email saying you know, you need to pay but then basically they they never like contacted me again about it. Gotcha. Just let me know and then you know, nothing else really after that they just kept the debt and then eventually they got paid for it and then I guess you know they sent confirmation about the payment.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok cool cool cool. Was that, do you I know you mentioned it was a it was a while back. Do you, do you remember it being like the emails? See the like what what was the experience like like did it did it was there? Did you find there was enough information? Too much? Not enough. Was it was it confusing at all or fairly clear?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. Yeah, I think it was it was enough. I'm looking through my emails now.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Yeah, you you know we've got we've got an example we can show you save you the time of of digging through your emails.
1. **Participant 05:**
1. I didn't find that specific email. I just found a general
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. gotcha
1. **Participant 05:**
1. V va debt email and you know it it basically said the dates and deferred stuff and then it it provide you with the links in case you want more information. Ok, so it it has enough in the in there and then if it applies to you, you can click the links to get more info.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. All right. Well, so we're gonna show you a current version of the email and get your, your impression. My colleague Elissa is gonna share. It takes a second to for Zoom to. There we go. So looking at this, this email, what are, what are your impressions? Does this, it does it is this helpful? What would you do? Is this, is this the right amount of information for you?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. To me this sucks to, you know, it's like, it's like a, it doesn't tell me anything. Want you to log in and, and log in is a hassle because you have two factor and all that other crap. It's not just a simple click. You gotta like actually log in and that takes time and, you know, if they, if you know, maybe and then it, and then half the time it's like, doesn't apply to you, you know, so you just wasted that time logging in and doing two factors for no reason. They should at least give you a bit more about what it is about.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Right. What, what, when you say a bit more? Well, tell me, tell me more about that. What would you like to see specifically? What would you like to see in the, in the email?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. It just says you have information available but, from the VA but that's it, you know, what is it about? Is it about my, you know, my claim? Is it about my medical stuff? You know, is it about pay payments just this is basically useless, it doesn't tell me anything. Mhm.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok cool. Yeah Elissa, do you have any questions or anything you wanted to drill in on, on this one? No, I'm good. Ok, cool. All right. So moving on to the next scenario. Have you ever received an appeal an appeal decision? Email? Oh sorry. Oh my gosh. You know, I'm sorry I skipped, I skipped over a section of this. Completely apologies. All right. So let's, we're gonna sort of construct a little scenario here. Imagine you got this and you either did nothing what, you know, whatever you did with it, you know, whether you signed in or not or whether you left it from later. Let's say, let's say, following this, you got another email that looked like this and the, the, the original was on the top and then the next email was on the, on the bottom there. Just tell me your, your impressions and, and your thoughts around this.
1. **Participant 05:**
1. They, you know, doesn't really tell me anything. I guess it's a, it's a bit more specific since it's, since it's coming from Debt Management Center. But, you know, it basically looks the same. So people would look at it as being the same. They wouldn't notice the debt management and VA veterans health being changed. Other than that is pretty much exactly the same.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Right. So, and would your assumption be that these are, are emails on the same topic or different topics?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. Same, same.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Cool.
1. **Participant 05:**
1. Unless I took more time to look at it, then I would notice, but on our initial glance, like this is the same crap, I'm ignoring it. Sure.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Sure. Sure. Yeah, that tracks. All right, I'm gonna pull back the curtain a little bit here and let you know that the first email is what a veteran receives, when they have a copay from like a, a medical appointment at the VA and the second one is for an overpayment of benefits. Like, if, for example, if you had a, oh, gosh, I'm blanking on the term, beneficiary like a, a beneficiary who, if you have the child.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah, that, that got too old, aged out from.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yeah. But it's the, and so sometimes the, veterans can get overpaid on benefits and then the, when the va sort of figures it out, you get the second letter here. So knowing that, can you tell me what, you know, what you might wanna see, in either of these?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. I guess if it's, so you said the, the, the initial email from the VA the VHA was about copay? I guess so they're letting you know that you, you have to pay a copay. Mhm. There's no harm, there's no harm in putting that in the email.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Right.
1. **Participant 05:**
1. Really? You know, you have a copay. Would you please log in, in, check it?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yup.
1. **Participant 05:**
1. And then same thing for the, the debt thing, you know, like you, your dependent status has changed, you know, please log in and clarify or verify whatever. Yeah, that's not, it's not enough information for like a security risk, I don't think.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Right. Right. Right. Ok, cool, thanks. Elissa, was there any anything you want to drill in, in on this?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Nope, that's exactly what I wanted to drill it on. So
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, sorry, I botched that
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Really good feedback though. I really appreciate it. Like that's, it's very helpful.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. Ok. So, the next one, have you ever, received an appeal decision, email? Like you appealed a claims decision and then received an email, regarding their ruling?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. Ok, if I have any…
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. And if you haven't, that's fine.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. It's, it's, we'll, you know, we'll just sort of, ask you to, you know, if, if you did, what would you, you know, what would you expect the content of that email to be?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. I'm not finding anything. Mhm. I did have an appeal granted in 2018, but I don't have an email for it. So maybe it was just a letter.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Congratulations. Thanks.
1. **Participant 05:**
1. Yeah. Yeah, I guess they, I guess they, they, I guess for me they mostly send me letters rather than emails. Mhm. I guess for for a letter you know, I mean for an email, I guess stating there's been a change in in your appeal and be and then be specific about what the appeal appeal was for. Mhm. You know, if it was related to like depression or lumbar strain, like your appeal for depression and lumbar strain has been changed, you know, please take a look.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. And sorry if I can pop in just to clarify. Is that like the specifics there? Is that what you would expect the email to contain?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. Yeah, like like yeah, yeah, like in this email section like you know, tell me what it's about, don't just say hey log in do this without no context.
1. **Participant 05:**
1. Ok?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. I just want to clarify and make sure I was hearing right?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. Yeah, if it's like about, you know, if it's like about your lumbar strain or depression then you know it's like important. So you wanna, you wanna check that right away?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, for sure. Ok, cool. So next we'll show you decision on appeal email and just look through it and yeah, just let me know your impressions. What what about what's here.
1. **Participant 05:**
1. I think this is provide enough information. It doesn't have the specifics about, you know, like what the what the exact appeal was. And yeah, the docket number is helpful if you, if you know what they're talking about, but most of the time, you know, claims take like a few months or sometimes a year. So you kind of forget. Sure. Like some people have multiple claims for different things. So, you know, knowing specifically what it was, you know, I guess it's not required but I think it would be helpful. Yeah, I could see that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Absolutely. Ok. Any, anything else? No. Ok, great.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. What would you do from here? Is there anything that, that you might need to take action on or do from this, this email?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. It doesn't specifically say to do anything. It just said that, you know, that will be sent to you and your rep. So I would, I would assume another email would come in but I would probably just click the link for appeal status and go check myself rather than wait.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Ok. And you said you would assume that another email would come. What would you anticipate that email having?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. I guess more information about the appeal, like what the decision was because they just said they, they issued a decision but it doesn't tell me what the decision was.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Ok. So this is, this feels more like a part one of two, like, like they're gonna formulate like the, the final response and then get back to you. But they just, is that a, I understanding that? Right.
1. **Participant 05:**
1. Yeah, I mean, I don't know what if they, if they've made the decision. I don't, I don't know why they don't just tell me now. I don't know what the, what the need for part two is, but I guess that's how they work. All right.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All righty. Moving right along. Have you ever, gotten, a notice, from the va about, for example, a document upload failing?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. No, I haven't. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Let's say you tried to upload some evidence for, you know, an appeal or, or, you know, just, you know, whatever and it failed. And you get an email from the va you know, on the subject, what would you expect that email to contain?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. I guess what documents failed. I guess after, after you said that, I guess I was thinking about the email that's on the screen right now. I think, I think having more information like about the exact claim and more details is helpful. I, I'm pretty decent about knowing if an email is, is a fake or not. You know, like, like this could be fake because it doesn't tell me really anything. This is a docket number looks official. Right. But if the VA was actually putting in, you know, exactly what it was about, then you would, you would know it's about you and it's not about you then, you know, you know, it's probably like a scam. So same thing with the, the fail upload. Like maybe you didn't upload. So maybe the, the benefit, it's like what documents failed then you would know. Yeah, I did do that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Got it. Got it more, more information increases the, the, the reliability. Got it. Ok. Great, great, great. All right. So next we'll, we'll show you an example of that email and yeah, just look through it and, and give us your impressions also. This is a longer one.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. So once you get to the bottom when you're ready for me to scroll, just let me know I'm ready.
1. **Participant 05:**
1. I guess this this is just more of a notice, doesn't really tell me to do anything.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Is there any is there any action you would take as a result of this email?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. Well, it just says what you should do and then it just says no action is needed. So, ok, I would just assume there's no action needed and and wait.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, great, cool.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. And how do you feel about the amount of information provided to you? Do you feel like it gives you a solid grasp of what's happening? Do you feel confident anything missing here? Anything that you particularly like don't like anything like that?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. Oh, I mean, I guess they give you like tons of links if I don't need to do anything. I don't know why giving me all those links but because they just want, best to have everything available all the time, I guess. Maybe, maybe some people have some, you know, really bad memory issues and they forget. So, I guess they include that, but it's not a huge deal. It's a bit more scrolling. Right.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yep. They, ok. All right. Next scenario. Have you ever, received an appointment, reminder email?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. Yes.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, great. can you tell me about, about it and you know what your experience has been?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. Just basically, I think it's just says, you know, you have an appointment. I guess mi mine recently had been virtual. So there was like, you know, you have a, a new appointment and then I, I think it just gave you the instructions on how to connect to the portal to do it virtually. And yeah, just, just helpful, you know, to, to get that to people forget about appointments all the time. So sure having reminder is helpful just in case you didn't forget. Mhm Great.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Well, we're going to show you an example of you have a question.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. I do, I do. So the messages that you currently get about your appointment reminders. I'm just curious. Like that experience, did you feel like you were provided with enough information? In addition to that, what are your thoughts on the cadence? Like how frequent you got? The reminders?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. I haven't had an appointment in a while, but I do recall the email kind of having like I think the doctor's name and like what the appointment was for. So, you know, that's, that's helpful to know what it was about. So you can, you can prepare just to know what to talk to the doctor, like who cause you remember what the appointment was for. And then I guess as far as the cadence, I don't recall being annoyed by a ton of them. So I think it was enough and not too, too much. OK. All right. That's all I got.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Thank you. Thanks. So, next, we'll show you a current version of the appointment reminders. And, yeah, if we could just get your, your impressions, your thoughts and this is another long one.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. So let me know when you're ready for me to scroll ready.
1. **Participant 05:**
1. Yeah. So this is a, an in person reminder.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. What would you expect it to be for?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. I guess it's giving me like the, the location. But I guess over there it says telephone video in person VA. So in this particular email I didn't notice it telling me what the appointment was for exactly. Oh, I guess, if you can scroll up above again, and they didn’t tell me who the doctor was. It doesn't really tell me anything. It's telling me the date and time. I recall mine stating the doctor and brief, you know what, like what the appointment title was. Mhm. So if that, if this, if this email had that then I think it would be suitable.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Great. So the doctor and the type of appointment.
1. **Participant 05:**
1. Yeah, like like like mental health or yeah, something like that or you know what, what it was about? Ok, great.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. But otherwise the the email is solid or is or is there anything else that yeah.
1. **Participant 05:**
1. I guess there, I guess if it's, if it was a, a video then I guess they would include a link in there. Ok. But may, maybe it's in person so, I mean, maybe it's phone calls and that's, that's why they put the phone number.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Got it. Ok, great. All right. Any, Elissa, anything else you want to drill in on before we move to the next one? Cool. I don't think so. All right. The next one, have you ever gotten a message from a va that you need to update your, your email, your mailing address? Any, any of your profile information?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. I don't think I've gotten anything specific. I think it's just one just, the generic. Make sure your info is updated. I think I've gotten a few of those but nothing just specific to me. It's kind of like a general notice to all vets. Mhm.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. If you did get a, a notice tailored specifically to you, what would, what would you expect, as far as the, the content of that email, or, and, and not only just expect but what would you like, like, you know, if, if it, if it was, you know, what would the perfect email on that subject contain?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. I guess they wouldn't put, like, if it was my address, they wouldn't put that in the email maybe for security, but maybe they, they could say, like, your information hasn't been changed in three years. You know, if you've moved since then, please check. Oh, ok, great.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. So, anything else? No. I think, and then I guess just the link to changing the info. Cool. All right. So we'll, we're gonna show you the, the current version of that and get your impressions that's covers, everything provides enough information.
1. **Participant 05:**
1. Oh, if it was me, I might, I might bold, like unable to deliver or something. Gotcha. They're, you know, they're bolding, please sign in. But you know why? I think bold the actual issue's important or underline or something would help, would help make the reason for their, for their communication clearer. Yeah, because they're always, you know, they're always sending emails to sign in but they tell me like they bold the reason why, then, you know, focus on that more.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Got it. Anything else? Nope. Ok. And, and what would you do? What would you do from here with this email?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. I guess I'm, I'm, since I know, a letter was not sent. I would go link right away and change that to make sure I get, get, you know, get any va mail, especially if I have a claim, don't wanna miss anything.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Mhm. And, for this just to, just to, follow through on a possible scenario, let's say you go, you logged in and your email address was current. What, what action would you take then?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. I guess I might message use the contact and you know, say, hey, I was told something wasn't delivered. I don't know what it was, but my information is correct. So, ok, yeah, tell me what, what I what I didn't get confirm that my address is correct.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, great. Then when you say message to contact, do you mean do you mean reply to this email or we on the website?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. Because in the email it says do not do not respond to the email. So I would, I would, you know, look on the website for contact info or ok, find, find out how to contact the VA ok, I guess, I guess including a number in, in this email like a direct line to the appropriate people would be helpful then. So I don't have to look for it myself since it says don't reply to the email. Mhm Like saying like you know what you need to do. And then, and then after below that, after below the link, saying if your information is correct, call this number.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Great, thanks. Anything else in here that you would wanna see different more or less?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. I think that's enough. Ok, great.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Unless, unless you have anything you wanna. Ok, great. All right. So on to the next one and we just have a few more and and we'll, we'll let you go. Have you ever received a notice of disagreement? Yes. Ok. Can you, can you tell me about that?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. Think that was also a letter for me? Ok. I, I checked my email for nod and didn't get anything. Ok. Or disagreements. I don't have a disagreement. Email. So I guess I got that the regular mail.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, a lot of these notifications are newer. So, especially you, you said you separated in 2009?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. Yeah, but my, my claim, my claims were until 2018.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Yeah. No, even it's, it. I, I'll say I'll say this about that. The va.gov has, has grown by leaps and bounds even since 28 to 2018. It's a completely different site. So, yeah, a lot, a lot of things are changing. I'd like to think for the better. And, yeah, that's, part of what we're trying to do here today. All right. So, do you, let's you, you mentioned there's, it's most likely a letter, can you tell us about that experience or do you have any, do you have any recollections about it?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. I guess it just told me what the NOD was about. And, yeah, I guess what I should do. You know how to appeal or, I can, you know, I think they say to contact your VSO or, or they give you a link on who to contact.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All righty. So we're gonna show you a current version of a notice of disagreement and get your impressions and where it, where it says where it says first name, that's, that's a, a variable that would substitute in your, you know, your first name and then, you know, just in case that's not clear and same with same with date submitted, it's code for inserting the correct variables.
1. **Participant 05:**
1. And then I guess where, where it says appeal details are below. Is that all I would say? Or would it tell me that?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. That is all it would say. That's no details then that's, that's a fair assessment, sir.
1. **Participant 05:**
1. I mean the, the subject says notice of degree. So you know, that's the, you already know that detail. They, they should tell you what, what it's about specifically. And then I guess it says we may contact you oh 75. So this is like this is the, this is the confirmation, something that I filed, correct?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Correct. And this is the confirmation that that you, that your notice of disagreement has been has been not, not ruled on but filed. In other words, like, hey, you sent us a notice of disagreement, we got it, you know, just letting you know.
1. **Participant 05:**
1. Yeah, I get, I would probably say received rather than filed. Filed could mean like, you know, somebody might think a decision was made but received just means we got it and that's it. And then maybe and then yeah, I guess some a bit more details about what what the nod was for and then and then I think that's enough since it like a an alert. Yeah, great.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. And this is and and you would how would you how would you use this email or what would you what would you do with it?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. I would just be like ok they got it, that's it and I guess I would just wait.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Great. Ok is there anything you wanted to fill in on? No, that's great. Awesome. Alright, last one, last one, here we go. Have you ever received a communication from the va about your va life insurance?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. I've gotten some of those recently so let me check if they were a letter or email. Yeah, so I haven't gotten anything specific about my life insurance policy in my email but I've gotten the a news emails that mention life insurance got you and an email from the VA benefits end of life planning that just tells you you're qualified for $40,000 worth of life insurance. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Well, let's say, you received the following email after, after making a change, to your account, this was after I actually made a change.
1. **Participant 05:**
1. Yeah, I think that's enough then comes up. I know I, I changed something or I wouldn't know if I change something. So then, ok, I think this is enough.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Now, second scenario, let's say you didn't change something and you got this email, I guess it says, yeah, I think it says we recently processed a change if you did not.
1. **Participant 05:**
1. So then I guess if I didn't, I didn't do anything that I would call.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Is there anything else you would want to see in this email or this is, this is, this is the, the ideal, I mean, if it, if they told me what change happened, you know, I guess maybe I did change something then I forgot.
1. **Participant 05:**
1. So then I would call in and be like, oh, then they were like, oh, you did this and like, oh yeah, I did do that. So if they like, you know, you, you added or removed beneficiary, you changed your address or something, then that would be more of a reminder for what I did since, right? A lot of vets have memory issues. We forget what we do. Sure.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, great. All right. Elissa. Anything else?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. No, I'm good.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. How are we doing on time? We have five minutes, five minutes. All right. I have a sort of a goofy question that I li I like to ask participants. And if, if you could, if we gave you a magic wand and we say magic wand so that you let go of like what, what is and what it can be and you know, or what you, what you think could be. And if we just say if you could change anything like you, you wave the wand and it's done. What's the one thing you would change about how the way the va communicates with you?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. I guess emails are better than, than mail. Ok. Basically when I get mail, I scan it so I can, you know, make sure to always have it. But if you get the email and, and when you log into the VA, all your letters are there, every single letter you've gotten is there. So even if you delete the email for that letter, it's all still there anyway, like the dates and what it was about. So basically every single thing that we sent you is always in the cloud that you can access.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. That's right. You are way more disciplined than I am, sir. I scanning, scanning your mail. That's, that's actually genius. I, I might have to, you might have to do that because yeah, because then you don't have two places where everything is. That's really smart. Ok, well cool. Thank you so much for your time. Was there, was there anything else you wanted to, to tell us about or or let us know before we let you go?
1. **Participant 05:**
1. No, I think that's it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Awesome pace. Thank you so much for your time. We really appreciate all of the opinions you've shared and we're gonna take, take them and try and make a the emails better. Three. Thank you, sir. Thanks. Bye. Take care. Bye. All right. But the recording.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah. Oops, hang on. Thank you.
1. 
1. **Participant 06:** INTERVIEW
1. 
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. So just to kind of get to know you a little bit. Can you tell us what branch of the military you served in?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. The Marine Corps.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And when did you retire or separate?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. August 31st 2006.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And since retiring or separating, have you received emails from the VA?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. Yes, I have.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Do any of them like, come to mind? Like, just topics that they covered?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. I, I've, gone in and, selected the ones that pertain to me specifically and then the ones that, may not pertain to me or the ones that I may not be interested in. I just deselect. So, the emails that I do receive, are the ones either pertain to me or interest me.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So, what, what kind of emails would those be?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. Emails general to, my specific VA, the, the, my, the benefits that I am either receiving or eligible for, schooling benefits, cause I'm in, grad school right now. so various kind of, emails like that?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. That's helpful. Can you tell us a little bit about the experience you have with the emails like frequency content relevance, that kind of stuff.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. What I get the frequency I think is great. It's not overwhelming where, you know, maybe like a, a store or something will bombard you with multiple emails on sales. just for an example, but I think the frequency is great. Like I kind of previously mentioned the content is relevant to me. So I'm I'm very satisfied with what the emails that I do receive.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, great. And as far as you seem very like like, oh my gosh, what is the word I am looking for? Like on top of it as far as like managing all of your preferences and things so like, and, and knowing like how you want to be communicated to. So having said that and do you feel the type of communications you're getting? I know you said you're, you're happy with them but maybe some other ones like we can think of like all of them like text messaging, emails, letters, things like that. Do you feel like you're being communicated to with the appropriate channels?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. Yes. Yeah, obviously there's like email, text social media. I, I'm not on all social media channels but yeah, for example, like on Facebook, you know, I follow the, my local va, for an example. Just so if, like, updates, if there's a outage or something that I know, like, oh, I might not go or whatever. But, I, it's kind of funny that you say that I, you've already noticed that I tend to be on top of things. I, I've kind of learned that over the years that, if you're not on top of things you can get bombarded. Whether, whether it be, unwanted emails or unwanted text or whatever, or, you know, just applying for va benefits or, or whatever the case may be. Like, I feel like if you're not on top of it or if you don't follow up then you can kinda be, either overwhelmed or, disregarded or, you know, forgotten about.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, that's super fair. Well, kudos to you because not everyone is like on their, a game for that.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. So my wife makes fun of me all the time for it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, I bet she doesn't make fun of your super clean inbox, right?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. I hate like, if I had like, I'm that type of person, like I can't have like any notifications on my phone, like, you know, where some people have like 1000 unchecked emails, like…
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. You're talking to the right people right now, Ian and I the same.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So like I have from the same cloth.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. Yeah, so I, I can't have like any un, you know, unchecked notification on my phone or email or text or whatever, like,
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Diligent. How about that? I like that.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. Yeah, that's the word. Yeah, that was the word I was looking for.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Well, we're gonna kind of move into the next sort of portion of this where we're going to walk through different types of email communication that the VA sends out currently. And kind of get an idea of, you know, if you've received something like this before, what if you have or haven't like, you know, your expectations and then we're going to show you an example and give you get your feedback on that as well. Ok. All right. So to get started, can you tell us about a time that you had an experience receiving a debt related email from the va I don't believe I've ever received a debt related email. Ok. If you did, what kind of information would you want the email to contain?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. Probably what department of the VA it's from, whether being compensation related debt or educational related debt. How much the debt is when the debt will start coming out of either compensation related benefits or educational related benefits. So I think probably those big three things. Ok, or, or, and also why the debt was incurred?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. Let's see. Well, Ian, why don't we go ahead and share and ok, so let's say that you received this email. What do you think it's about? And is there anything that you would or could do from here?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. I don't necessarily think I would click on this link from this email because the email seems kind of a a little too bland. It doesn't even like at the bottom you can't really like is it, is it kind of, it, it almost looks like a spam email. If if I were to receive something like this, I wouldn't click on the link. I would just go like directly to the va dot gov website on my browser. Just to maybe verify if it is legit or not, but I would probably disregard this email.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So having said that what are some things that you would look for that would make you feel more confident in including that?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. Maybe something on the bottom or something that verifies that it is like legit or has something like some type of information. I think just like,
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. ok, if you can't think of something, I just curious.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. Yeah. No, I, I think it's just, it's just too bland. I think it, it would definitely need more more information.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok? That sounds like it makes sense to me. So let's say you've received this email and then shortly after that, you receive this next email and we're gonna show them on the same screen. So you could kind of have a visual comparison, just kind of talk us through. You know what you think this next one is about and if there's anything you could or would do from here and just how you would feel about getting the one shortly after the first one.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. The second one, you know, says it's from the debt management. kind of the same thing I said about the first one where it's super bland, so I wouldn't click the link or anything in this email. But it's at least it says it is from the Debt Management Center. So if I were to log on to va dot gov from my browser and I I know that I could go directly to the debt debt part of that. Just to possibly verify that this email is legit.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And would there be any confusion with receiving these so close in time to each other or does it seem like it makes, would be fine and makes sense?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. I think it would be kind of almost redundant and receiving them back to back. I think receiving them back to back would make it even more sketchy if you will.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Ian, do you want to jump in here and spill the beans on what this this is? Real quick and then we can gauge some feedback on thoughts after that.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yep. Yep. So I'm gonna pull back the curtain here a little bit and let you know that the first one here is an email a veteran would get when they have an outstanding copay for a medical visit. And the second one is in regards to an overpayment essentially. Let's say you, you got overpaid on benefits for, for whatever reason. This is the email that you would get for, for that. So knowing, knowing that what would you, what would you want to see in these, like, what would be, what would, what would you want to see in these emails? What would, what would help make more clear and identifiable?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. I think kind of what I've already stated like the type of debt that it is whether it be copay or a debt from whatever, how much the debt or copay is or, or just, just, I think just more information in general, it's just, it's it just yeah, I think just kind of have already stated.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right, that's fine. All right, cool. Thank you. We're gonna go ahead and move on to the next type for this next email type. Can you tell us if you have any experience appealing a decision from the va regarding like benefits? For example, I have but it's been, quite a few years.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. So, oh, well, it's, I feel like it's been a long time but I, I do, I have had experience with appeals.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So let's, since it's been so long and you probably don't remember exactly, if you do, amazing. But if not, maybe just kind of tell us what kind of stuff you'd wanna see in that email that would be helpful, what kind of what you want or expect.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. Maybe each step of the process that the appeal is in. If it's still under review, if it's under review, if it's a decision has been made. And I think definitely keep an update on each step of the process that the appeal is in. if you're diligent like myself. I, I, I would me personally, I would be checking that stuff every day but for maybe those that aren't as vigilant and diligent, getting an email or a text or whatever with the step that the appeal is in.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Let's see here. All right. Let's say that you've recently appealed a decision that the va made about your benefits and then you receive this email about it. What type of questions do you have? Is there anything you would do from here? Is it providing you with enough information?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. I think this, this email is definitely a lot better than the, the first two. I like how it, it provides information that a decision has been made. The case number, the docket number, that it was sent to your, the veterans VSO I like how it provides the, you know, the website or the phone number to, check the status or, of it. Yeah, I definitely, I, I feel this, this email has a lot better information.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And what are you feeling like this would be more just based on what we were saying about the past too? Does it feel more legit to you?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. I believe so. Yes.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yes. Ok. That's good to know. And how, what are your thoughts on the decision, was made? Would you want to see that decision here or do you think that that's something that you should have to log in for? I think that would be something that you should log in for?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. Because I know most of the time when it comes to decisions, whether it be in appeals or initial initial applications that, you, you get the paper copy in the mail. So you can't even, you can't even log in to see what the decision is. You will, in my experience, you might receive an email like this or some, some sort of notification that a decision has been made. But, you're in the dark until the post office delivers that. And, oh, so, but II, I think that, it's better that, you are not, I, I like how that is, you are notified but I think it's best, that you could log in to see, what the decision is.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Yeah, that's, I actually had no idea how that works. So, thank you for explaining that. I, I was like, what are the steps?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. I, I don't know if it's still the same way but, you know, the last time I went through it was, not an appeal, but a, a decision was, and 21. So two years ago, I received a notification and then, sometimes the mail is, slow, especially if it's coming from, you know, several states away or if it's coming from, the federal government. it's like, oh, I got a decision but then you don't find out the decision until several weeks later when, and you're like, anxiously waiting to check that you check the mail every day and it's like, oh, it hasn't come, you know. But, but I don't know if it's still the same, but that was my, always been my experience. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Just, just to clarify and make sure I, I just wanted to repeat back to you what I heard to make sure II I understood. You're saying that if, if you could log, if at this point, if you could log in and see the details and not have to wait for the, the paper copy. That's, that is, that would be preferable. Ok, cool. Awesome, cool, great.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Any other feedback you wanna give us on this one, P6 before we move to the next one on this one?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. Ok, cool.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right, we're gonna move on and talk about a different type of email. Let's say that you submitted a document to the va and something went wrong in the process of submitting this document, like for example, a system error and it caused that document to not be filed and then you receive an email. What kind of details would you want or expect that email to include?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. Ok. Was the document or information submitted in like a why it was rejected? Was it submitted in a wrong format where you know say va only accepts PDFs and you send it as like A jpeg or a or whatever. So why it was I guess rejected or not taken? I would say probably how to instructions on how to resubmit it. I think that's probably the two big things I would say.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. OK. All right. So let's go ahead and take a look at an example and you know, look it over and let us know, you know, if you have any questions, anything you find confusing, anything that you find helpful. If there's anything missing. Also I know I just said a whole lot of stuff but this is a pretty long one. So when you get to the bottom, just let Ian know so he can scroll.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. Mhm. you can scroll down. Ok. I would say that, I mean, I, I like it's the section where it says what you should do, says no action is, you know, needed at this time, and follow up to any, correspondence. I think it's pretty self explanatory, and kind of like the last email, there's, more, information in it. So it, it does seem, legit if you will. so I, I think this, this, this email is a, is a pretty good one.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And I know prior to looking at this example, one of the things that you mentioned you would wanna know. Oh, gosh, I think you said, let me, let me know if I'm misremembering, the file, like the file name or type or what the file was that was not accepted. Oh, yeah, in the previous one.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. Why it was rejected?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. Yeah. Would you be, how do you feel about, the level of detail around that here?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. I think it's fine in this email because, it, it, it doesn't necessarily say why it was rejected but it, it says that, you know, it was, you know, identified. And, and a thorough review is being, gone through, I would expect maybe that to be in, maybe the follow up or any, like the next correspondence received.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And let's say you had a question about this message or, about, that submission not going through. What would you, who would you reach out to or what would you do from here?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. I would probably call the number. And do you mind scrolling, please?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Thank you.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. Yeah, I would probably call that 1 800 number. Because I feel like sometimes, something like this if you, if you went to the website, it would basically say the same thing that's at the top of the email. So I feel like calling the 1 800 number. You would get, better information than, may or maybe a little more information than going to the, like va dot gov.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Ian, did you have any further questions on this one? No, P6, anything further you want to share on this? Ok, great. Ok, so the next one I'm pretty sure that you mentioned you already are receiving. But have you scheduled an appointment at a va facility and received an email about that?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. I get the text for my appointments. I don't get the emails.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Got it because the preference setting, right?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, cool. Well, in this situation, let's just hypothetically say that you did get the email. What kind of information would you expect that email to provide you
1. **Participant 06:**
1. Clinic location. Clinic name, date time, the clinic's phone number if you need to reschedule or cancel,
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. You said name, what you like your name or no, like
1. **Participant 06:**
1. the cli the clinic's name. So like, like podiatry or primary care or specialty. Yeah. And then I would, I would probably also add in the, the provider's name. Just see, like, so like the clinic name and then the provider's name. I would add it in that as well.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Anything else? I'm sorry, because I kind of interrupted you.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. I, I think that's, I think that's about it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. Well, let's say that you did make an appointment and you received this email. This is another one that has a bit of a scroll to it. So same as the others, you know, look it over. Does everything kind of feel like it makes sense here. Is there anything further? You wish we had, things like that?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. You can scroll down, please. Can you scroll down more, please? I, I would probably, I mean, it has the date and time, the, the VA facility, the clinic's information or the phone number. I would definitely add in which clinic you're, you would be seeing, especially since it's at a VAMC versus like AC. And, you know, obviously hospitals are fairly large, you can go there and have no idea, you know, what part of the hospital to go to or what clinic. Obviously you could, you could find that out. But, I would add in, you know, the, the actual clinic that you're seeing and that the clinic's, extension. So if you call the, the hospital's phone number, you, once again you wouldn't know, who you're seeing, or their extension. So I would add in the, the clinic that you're seeing and the clinic's, telephone extension number.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, great.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. I was just gonna, I was just gonna, follow a thread there. You mentioned that, that you could find out where the, like where you needed to go or what the appointment was. What's your, what's your, what's your current sort of procedure for doing that? How do you, how do you go about that?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. I mean, a lot of the high, I know, you could go to like the information desk at the hospital and just say, like, I know I have an appointment on, June thir, you know, today June 13th at, you know, 2 20. But I'm not sure. So you can go to like the information desk at the hospital. I, I guess you could call that hospital number and just, you know, ask for, I like, press zero to speak to a representative, you know, and then say, hey, I got an appointment but I, I don't know, you know who I'm seeing or where to go.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Ok, great. Yeah, I imagine they get lots of calls like that every day.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. I'm sure.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Cool, thanks.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right, everyone. Good to move to the next one.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. I'm good.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, cool. All right. Have you ever received an email from the va that something on your va profile needs to be updated?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. I don't believe so.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, if, if you did, what kind of things would you expect? That email to be, telling you about?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. I would say what information needs to be updated, why it needs to be updated and how to update it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Let's see here. Well, in this scenario, let's say that the va needs to update or confirm your mailing address and you receive this email. You know, same as the others. Take a look at it, let us know if it's providing you with the right type of information, things are clear what you would do from here.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. I think it's pretty self explanatory. I think it provides the what needs to be updated, why it needs to be updated and how to update it. So I think it, it it's it provides the information and how to correct it. So I, I think there's a, it's a good email.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Great, Ian. Do you have anything you wanna ask, Adam before? Move to the next one?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Oh, so in this email they say, you know, you got something, mail got returned. All right, let's say you log in and your, and your contact information is correct and current, how, what would you do then?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. Is, is there a phone number or something down below? I would probably, I guess I would add in like the, the 1 800 number or whatever, to the email. And, I would call, if I were to, if, find that my, information is correct. I know I, my wife and I just built a new house. So, I have not necessarily with the VA per se but I know I had difficulty with, other companies and organizations trying to update my address but it was a new construction. So, I know I was having issues with that. My address wasn't recognized in in the system yet. So it it was kind of difficult getting that all. So I can I can kind of relate to this email a little bit because I literally just went through it.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Wow. I that's a super interesting problem but I never even considered that like, yeah, but, but when and or how do new address? Like does the Google, does the Google car have to drive by your house? Oh, it's like, hey, there's a new address now.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. My, my house doesn't even show up on the maps yet. It's just a I still like still like an empty cornfield.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Just have to reassure people they're not going to a creepy place like it's a house. I swear it's like it's really there.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. It's not a cornfield but like having like having like the only person that at the post office can do it is the postmaster themselves. So like the head person at each post office. And then it takes X amount of days in the post office database to process and then it takes X amount of days in each company's database to process the update from the post office, this database. And oh my gosh, and it's and then you literally do like, you, you, you have to, you know, I, we had to get our, we live in the country. So we're in kind of like a township of, you know, so we had to get our address registered with the, you know, the, the the township had to, the township sets the address, not the post office. And it's it, it was quite the ordeal so I can, I can definitely relate to this email cause I, I legitimately just went through it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. I just learned something. I had no idea. It just, nothing that would even occur to you, right? Until you, you say Google because like I literally had to go on Google and then go to my address and the address on Google was like stuff.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. So I had to like move the pin on Google to the correct location on Google. And and literally just this past weekend, my wife wanted me to order her new shoes from like Dick's sporting goods. And when I went into the profile to update our address on Dick's because we hadn't done that yet. And it was auto populated. I, you know, I put in the address and then the zip code and it you couldn't put in your city, it would auto populated the city. And it was auto populating the wrong city. So I another example of of something that is so convenient, right?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Like normally if you add your zip code and it just populates the city. You're like, oh, thanks. That's great. But in this situation it's like, oh, no, but like, no, just we need to do this. And it was funny because even the like the four digit extension, the four digit zip code extension was correct too.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. But it was like, it's just, so I can definitely relate to this email, for sure. Nice.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. The next one is pretty niche. So if you've not dealt with it, then we'll probably just skip it. But have you ever filed a notice of disagreement with the va I have not.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. Ok, then we will move on to the next one and this is our last one.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So, have you ever received an email from the VA regarding your va life insurance?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. I have when I I filed for or I applied and did it right when it opened up or the new, the new Life insurance opened up last the beginning of last year. So I think I received one or two emails about that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And do you recall, having any questions about those emails or feeling like they, they kind of like knocked it out of the park. You could understand everything they were trying to tell you or anything like that.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. It, it, they were pretty self explanatory. It's just like, we've received your application for VA Life. Or I think that's what it's called. And then I think the second one was like your, basically said something along the lines of like your, your policy has been processed and which I, I thought was fine. And I like that it just let me know that what step of, you know, what step it was in. I mean, it, I didn't, I didn't necessarily really need, you know, my policy number or the amount that I applied for, I just, I just like that it was provided me what step of the process that, that the that it was in?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Well, let's say a change was made to your va life insurance and then you received this email, let us know what type of questions you would have if you receive this email and if there's anything you would do from here.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. I think it's kind of like the first two emails. I think it's kind of bland, it doesn't re yes, it says that there's documents to review or there's been a change. I think there could, I, I I, I just, I don't like how there's, it's just like there's, it just says VA Insurance Center. I ju I think there could be maybe a little more information on the bottom kind of like the previous emails where, you know, it does see it, it does seem a little more like this doesn't seem very legit. I think there could be some more identifying va information maybe at the bottom of the email.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. OK. Ian any further questions for Adam?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Just, just one quick question. One of the tools we have in our kit is that typically we know the veteran's name and we can use that in, in the, in the greeting would, would something like that increase the confidence or does that? Oh, no, not, no more details.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. I mean, if spammers can get your name and all that. So I don't necessarily think that adding the veteran's name. I just, I think just kind of like I said, just more at the, at the bottom just kind of make it more more legit. So it doesn't seem kind of like a, like a spam email. Can you flip back to maybe a couple of the other ones and see if there's anything in particular that, that Adam see that he's liking or that's kind of resonating just like this one, you know, what you need to do, how, how to do it. go go to the website. You know, like this one, it has, you know, the phone number, the date and time that the call center is open. All that where that the, this last one, it's just like, you know, the insurance center like, yeah, that's a, that's an excellent point.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. It is, it is scant on details and, and, and yeah, there's typically a, a standard sign off that's missing here your typical signature if you will.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. Like there's, yeah, like the footer of the email or something.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. Yep.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. I see. I'm trying to see these are all different but yeah, like that one actually has somewhat of a foot.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, this is a, yep.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yep. Yep. But it's missing the phone number. So, yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Mhm. Well, Adam, is there anything else that you wanna share with us that we didn't cover today?
1. **Participant 06:**
1. No, I thought, I thought it was, you know, pretty self explanatory. I enjoyed it. Great.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Awesome. We did too.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So did we, yeah, we really appreciate you taking time out of your day to share your thoughts and with us, this feedback that you gave us, it's gonna be really helpful as we try and make some guidance and continue to improve on these email communications from the VA. So hopefully, you know, you'll see, see some changes coming through. But, thank you so much and, hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
1. **Participant 06:**
1. Oh, you too. Right. Well, thank you guys for your time and I hope you have a great day. Thanks. You take care now.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Bye.
1. 
1. 
1. **Participant 07:** INTERVIEW
1. 
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So, can you tell us what branch of the military you served in?
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Sure. Seven years Air force. 24 years army. Wow.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Thank you for your service. That's wonderful. When did you retire or separate?
1. **Participant 07:**
1. So, I, I did seven years air force active duty. I was a pilot and then security police and then I separated became guard. I was Alaska Guard, Texas Guard and then army reserve and retired in March 2016 off of an active duty tour at the Pentagon. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. That is very impressive.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. And combat service. Afghanistan, the horse behind me. I'm riding horses in Afghanistan. And then, also Bosnia Kosovo and another GW country.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Oh, wow. That I didn't even realize that that was you. That's really cool.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Yeah, that's no, central Afghanistan. It's where the Bamiyan Buddhas were destroyed and then I rode horses as well in northern Afghanistan. And I don't know if you're familiar with the movie 12 Strong, but I'm the third, the third iteration after that movie, working with those warlords riding horses in the North. Wow.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, for sure. Well, since you've retired or, you know, separated, do, have you, received any emails from the VA?
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Certainly.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And any of those stand out or that you recall, like, just generalized types of messaging that you received from the VA.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. So, there's multiple types of correspondence that I get from the VA. So, VHA, you're familiar with it, right. The veteran health administration, has a portal called My Healthy Vet. And that is a fantastic service to be able to interact directly with your physician in a secure message format and a lot of those processes. I have multiple areas where I talk to different parts of the medical system that supports my needs and very responsive. In fact, it's, it's easier and better for VHA and for me, most of the time to use that system rather than to use phone calls because sometimes it's like 14 or 20 calls to be able to get through. And if I can send the message, I know that in my regular email, I'll have a email that says go to your portal and respond and I know that the portal is secure. So, I don't know if that, if that is helpful to you, but that's a, a process where there's an email that comes to my commercial or public email that directs me to the portal to deal with my, tasks that I email back and forth in the VHA website. Does that make sense?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. So, that's super. So my healthy vet is a very great process if it's used and it, it helps veterans well, and, you know about it because you get a ping in your regular email to, directly to the website. So that is the regular activity I use additionally. I get emails. And, and this is an area for improvement for the VA but because I travel, my parents summer in Minnesota, winter in Florida and I live in Northern Virginia. So I'm associated with the Washington DC Medical Center in Irving Street in Washington DC. But when I travel, Minnesota, I use the Saint Cloud VA or I use the Palm Bay VA in Florida. And all three of them have messaging systems. So they send emails that are kind of like going to a website, right? It's a whole series of update information. And where this is an area for improvement is that the Saint Cloud VA is five star. They are, they are the, what's the the business term best of breed or, or top notch in the way that they present. And there is critical, important information that I should have been told in Washington that I received from Saint Cloud. Does that make sense? Saint Cloud keeps you informed of medical device problems or of all kinds of when shots are gonna be available, when things are happening. And so those emails that come from Saint Cloud, Minnesota prompt me to ask the questions in in Washington DC. But everybody who's sending all three medical centers who send out these blast emails and the VHA as a whole send out these things. Saint Cloud is the most usable, most valuable Palm Bay is the second most usable, most valuable and I rarely get anything of value at all from the Washington DC Medical Center. That is where I actually am getting my service. Does that make sense? Am I clear?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. Mhm.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. And you kind of understand what I'm talking about with a, with an email like this. It's a bannered email from the from the medical center and then it's got links and a whole bunch of stuff and, and current information and so
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Kind of like a newsletter, right?
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Better than a newsletter. But yeah, and, and the Saint Cloud, the Saint Cloud does a really great job. Let me see here. I don't know if you're can you allow me to share with you share a screen and I'll show you.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, sure
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Got it right. Ok. Share here is a Saint Cloud VA update, guess what they're doing? The COVID vaccines now available. They provide a number of things. All of this kind of information you know, a tremendous amount of really healthy, valuable stuff. So, I, I've been trying to figure out who I could actually tell and say, hey, if you were actually gonna do something, that was so I don't know what you call this as a product as an email product, but this is amazing and it provides super valuable information and I get it from Saint Cloud. I think I also get it from Palm Bay
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. P7, It looks right there that they're calling it the monthly newsletter for veterans served by the the Saint Cloud va health care system.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Yeah. So let's see, I don't think, I don't think I see one that's, that's from Florida. But so I get these kind of things as well which are really helpful. So I get when my next appointments are if I have to make an adjustment, it shows you know the cancel. Can you still see that?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Mhm. Yeah.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Ok. Yeah. So it shows you know, the cancel and everything else and I get I get these which are great. We've got a prescription in the mail for you.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. And what kind of stuff do you like seeing in this message? You said this, this type of message is great. What is it that you that you like that? This email has?
1. **Participant 07:**
1. So when you go on the on the prescription website, it says you can order this stuff and then it's kind of like, playing roulette. You, you know, it's gonna come sometime but you don't really know when, but then I have fedex tracking and I have a date when I can expect it. And so I know when to look for it. Just like those appointment issues, if I go through the list of appointments and there's an appointment that I don't remember that I had, I can call and say, which is this appointment for? So, yeah,
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Well, I think what we wanna do at this point is we're gonna kind of show you different types of email messages that some I'm sure that you'll be very familiar with.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. And just get your opinion on, you know, like if you have any questions about the email, if things are making sense, if you like what kind of things and content and information you'd want from a certain specific type of messaging. So, the first one that we want to talk about is a debt related email. Have you had any experience receiving emails? Not those I received by, by paper mail?
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Ok. So, again, here, I'll tell you I have a pretty robust interaction with the VA and not all of it. Great. So, when I left active duty, I had a II, I got a 10% va disability. I left the Air Force and the Air Force. in error combined my last month's pay, my terminal leave and my va separation pay. And so it was amalgamated and I wound up writing the va and the VA corrected it, but they didn't correct it in a way that made sense to me. And then when I retired from the army, the army said I owed $11,000 that I didn't owe because it was my last month's duty pay and my terminal leave. And it took me almost two years to correct. And eventually I wrote the Deputy Secretary of Defense and said, hey, you just had a problem confirming the Secretary of the Army for the same problem that I have. And four days later, I had a deposit in my account to pay me back the amount that I wound up paying. But that debt came up like five different times where they kept trying to charge me the debt that I didn't owe. And and then eventually they took it all away from me and then they gave it back to me. So I've got a lot of experience with debt that most people don't have. And I'm really good with bureaucracy, which most people aren't. And so the whole process with debt was significantly challenging because, I think we've had people commit suicide over a debt that shouldn't have been, you know, a debt that shouldn't have happened. And, and so they, they've wound up with this debt and not knowing how to deal with it and knowing it isn't valid. And I think we've had people die over it.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. P7. I'm so sorry you went through that. That's, that's a bummer.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Well, it is, it is what it is. But I think the value is that I can talk to debt in a way a lot of people can't sorry for telling you the long story. But go ahead with what your issues are with, with this.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. You're OK. No, that was really very helpful information. I mean, honestly, the experiences are what we're interested in learning about as well, you know. So, so you,
1. **Participant 07:**
1. So debt management, yeah, debt management Center in Saint Paul Minnesota is only only has the ability to action the debt.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. They don't have the ability to determine if the debt is valid. They don't have a way to focus you back to a way to resolve a problem if the debt isn't valid. I was lucky because I had a friend who was at the regional office who corrected this over and over and over again for me. And every time it came up, I had a way to resolve it with the VA until DOD didn't listen to the VA and then made me pay for it and then I had to pay it back. Wow. So, so they, they paid me back.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Debt management has no, no power to adjudicate. They're just, they're just
1. **Participant 07:**
1. it's not their job, right. They're a debt collector and I appreciate their role. What I wish we had was a, a place for somebody to go to, to be able to adjudicate. I wish there was sort of an adjudication center or a middle step. Hey, you just gave this debt, the debt's not valid. How do we resolve it? And they can't even tell you go back and talk to so and so because the system doesn't allow that, so that becomes problematic, but that's, you know, not everybody will know what I just said. That's a unique, another unique area where I have more experience than most.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, I gotcha. So you are saying that you get your debt related things via a letter,
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Right.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. If you were to receive something debt related via email, you know, which may bring with it different levels of like what you feel confident or secure having in it, what kind of information would you want to see in a debt related email?
1. **Participant 07:**
1. So if we were doing it by email, we should say what the debt is, why the debt exists and what the obligation is to resolve it and who you could go to if you contest the debt. So if you talk to Debt Management Center, there's only two things they can do. They can either give you a process to slow down the repayment or they can give you a process to accelerate the payment, but they don't have any way to mitigate the payment or to, or to be able to tell you who to go to, to ask about the resolution of the payment if you think the payments not just.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, thats seems fair to have something in there to direct people.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, I'm gonna have Ian share his screen and we're going to share an example of an email and we want you to look it over and tell us what you think this email is about and if there's anything that you would or could do from here you.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Ok. So this is just a cold thing. This isn't something that I'm expecting.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Correct.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Manage VA debt, ok? This is a ok. So this is like a 40% disabled or a 20% disabled or a category six or seven VA I don't know if you're familiar with this, but there's eight different, eight different categories of people who who get va care or who are eligible for va care. And of the eight category one is 50% or more. Category two is 30 or 40%. And then they, they go down to a whole series of lesser categories and anybody who's category two or below has to provide insurance or coinsurance information when they when they get health care. So this looks like something that would be related to a medical debt or a medical insurance, but it might be, it might be a, you know, if it's, if it's something they're not expecting, I don't know how, how to write it, if there's something that they might be expecting. I might want a little more information to say this is regarding your, your coinsurance or this is regarding VA health care payment or something because that's what the, the website says, gov manage va debt. So, and it's from VHA, so the only reason it would be, would be a health care, health care cost.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. And you sound really in the know about these things like a lot of like detail. Is this common knowledge or is this something? Ok. All right. So you, you have some, I have,
1. **Participant 07:**
1. I have lived the good and the bad of the VA very comprehensively and a lot more comprehensively than most veterans.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. So, how many people have you talked to so far in this? Have you, have you talked to a bunch or, or a few four or five?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. I was gonna say four now.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. And did they, did they give this level of detail or not? Really?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. You're the first. It's like a magic trick, sir. I'm, I'm impressed but I, yeah, yeah.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. So, you know, I, I would love to be able to provide a support to the va at a level greater than just these random events where I can sign in like this because again, I think that I have a lot of detail that I could be very valuable to do.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, I agree. Our limited exchange here at least is, is a proof of that. So let's say you have received this email and then shortly after you got this email, you got this next email and Ian's gonna share it, it's going to be the one on the bottom, the one on the top is the one we were just looking at, but we want to make sure you can see them side by side. What would your thoughts be? And what actions would you take if any?
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Yeah. I would, I would try to respond immediately, especially if I got the second one because it tells me that I'm going to have a debt that I'm gonna have to resolve. And if it's not valid, I've got a very short window to try to work the bureaucracy of it. I, I do have one other story that I can give you real quick and it's not an, it's an education debt, not a not a not a VHA debt, but my son has used education benefits and he wound up because of a change in credit hours or, or something, he wound up with a small debt and we were able to resolve it real quickly out of his next payment. So, I am familiar with debts other than to myself as well, but not for VHA
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. ok.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. But I certainly would respond to that second one. The first one, the first one, I might be a little bit less likely to respond. The second one, I definitely would respond to it, because I'd want to figure out what's going on. So the, the second one is a little more urgent and a little more information and more information is better than more vague, like the first one.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So when you're seeing these, are you viewing them as, like, the same issue it's talking about or as two separate types of communications?
1. **Participant 07:**
1. I think they're the same issue. I would, I would certainly expect that they're both related to the same story. And, and it looks like they sent me a kind of a generic message, then they sent me a more urgent message and then they said there's a follow up written correspondence. So, I I think the second one is much more compelling that we have to do a, a very quick response. The first one is maybe I'll get to it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, so P7, what if I told you that the first one is actually regarding a copay and the second one is regarding an overpayment, you mean that, that the va owes me money back that you owe the va money for, like, let's say you had a beneficiary that aged out and it wasn't updated or the system didn't catch it. And so they overpaid you, so now you owe them money.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Oh, ok. Yeah. All right.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Would that be clear to you?
1. **Participant 07:**
1. I see, I see, I see what you're saying. Yeah, because the, because the first one is tied to VHA and the second one doesn't have the VHA moniker on it. So, absolutely. The, the second one, the second one is more, is more like one that I'd be familiar with. The first one, I've never had any of that and, and I don't ever expect to have anything like that first one. Ok. So, yeah, I can, I can understand, I can understand what you're saying. So the second one is a VBA debt. The first one is a VHA debt.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. And do you think that that's something that is, would be pretty apparent if it came across your email or
1. **Participant 07:**
1. For me, for me it would be, you know, I understand the VHA, the VBA, the National Cemetery Administration.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. You know, I understand the lines of effort of the VA, I, I probably understand them better than a lot of va employees do and I certainly understand them better than a lot of veterans do. And, one of the biggest problems of the VA is that we don't, articulate well, which line of effort something's happening in.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. So P7, knowing, knowing that the first one is, is a, is a medical copay for, for example, for a, a visit to the va like a labs or something, right? It's probably probably 25 $30 whatever. And the other one is, you know, a debt that's potentially from 30 to, you know, who knows how much, right? 11,000 in your case. Yeah, what would you want to see? What would you want to see in these emails?
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Well, I think what you're trying to do is, articulate that these emails demonstrate a problem first, I would not like it to say dear veteran. I would like to have it addressed to me personally because, because if you just have it a generic, a generic address, I'm more likely to think that it's fraud then. So, so if you're actually addressing a problem I have it should, it should have my name, not Veteran. And that may be just the way you've, you've done it for this, but it, it should, it should, you know, dear veteran ex name, you know, certainly would be an important thing and then the second thing would be some reference. So all of these debts, wind end up with a code, a reference code number or a reference number that I could tie to debt management. And so that would be important as well because the more information that you'd have, the more likely I am to immediately respond to it. So, dear veteran, you have information available to Debt Management Center. See reference code ABC D, you know, for further correspondence or, and, and for information, please call debt Management Center at 1 800 you know.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Mhm.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. So, so that the, the more information, the better and especially with people who aren't, aren't sure about how to deal with everything. And I appreciate these are secure websites. So being secure websites, they'll they'll be able to you know, manage the story.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah, great. Thanks for that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Un unless you have anything additional to add to this one, we can move to the next one. the next type of email that we're going to talk about is an appeal decision. So, ok. Have you ever do you have experience appealing a decision with the va regarding your benefits? For example, I do and I do with helping other people do claims as much as I do with myself.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. So I the claims process has radically improved in the recent years compared to where it was years and years ago. So there's a lot of reasons for that. So are you, are you showing me a new email? Are you not yet?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. We kind of before we show you, we kind of wanna get an idea of what your experience has been if you had one. and, also like what kind of information you would expect to see in these emails and then we'll show you the example.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah. If we, if we, if we show you first, then it prejudices your answer.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. So we want to know what you would expect and then we show you and say, yeah.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Ok. So, another short vignet, and I'll, you know, I'll make this pretty generic. But, when I, when I left active Air force, I had a 10% disability that over the course of the next 20 years or so, moved from 10% to 40%. Then I was in Bos Bosnia, Kosovo Afghanistan, injured in Afghanistan. And another go co co country. And, I had applied for benefits and was denied benefits for my injuries in Afghanistan. Then I was activated at the Pentagon on a 10 month tour that lasted 39 months and I was working for Secretary of the Army. And when I retired, I had it over that 39 months documented. Well, all these issues that never were properly documented before. So when I retired, I had 26 different items I was dealing with. And, do you know the va rating scale? Do you know how that works? The combined ratings? Ok. I'm not a bit so, real quick. It's a pie. Chart if, if you draw a line down half the pie and say you're 50% disabled, what percentage are you healthy? 50%. Ok, then you get a 10%. N next reading. So 10% of 50% is five, so 55 is 55. And that rounds at the fives to be 60 then you've got 45% not disabled and that you get another 10%. So 4.5. So that's 59.5, which rounds at the fives to be 60 then you get 40% left and, you get another 10%. So 4%. So you've got a 50 a five, a 4.5 and a five. So you're at 64 to 63.5. So 63.5, rounding at the fives is 60%. So you have to have a 50% and four tens in order to get to 60%. So, do you understand how this works? It's a, it's a diminishing percentage of your healthy. So when I initially got my rating, I have 26 items that I'm dealing with and I got a 70% rating. So I know that they've missed half of what I've got. Then they moved it to 80% and I, and I appealed or further, further worked it and then they moved it to 90% and then I further worked it and then they moved it to 92% 93% 94% with a special compensation. So by, by now they've kind of pissed me off. If they would have given me a 90% rating out of the gate, I would have never come back. But now I've had to be nickel and dimed over and over and over. And this 17 month process eventually gets me to 98% on the scale. So I'm on 100% va disabled veteran, but I had to fight for every single thing that they wouldn't do. And one of the areas they gave me was this 60. They gave me a not service connected. I said, I've got this thing, I've been taking meds for, you know, 20 years on from the military and they said unknown condition, not service connected. So then I just hand ran through my records, 23 pages of documentation named Condition Med, name, condition med, name, condition Med. And then they gave me a 60% rating for that condition, which is the 100% for that condition. So the bureaucracy of this is I trusted that the va would manage the system in VBA and they made me do significant amounts of double and triple work after they had my full records and didn't look at them so sorry, sorry for the long story on that. But, but again, this whole, the whole claims process I believe is much better than it was even, you know, seven years ago, eight years ago because this was 2016, 17 when I actually went through this process over and over again. So, yeah,
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. I'm, I'm so sorry to hear that P7. That's
1. **Participant 07:**
1. no problem.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. I, that's why I really wanted to talk to you because I think I'm a, a good example of understanding what you need to do to, to help and improve.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Right. Yeah. Yeah, we're, we're, we are, we are here for the same reason.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Yeah, so thank you so much.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Our goal. Oh, our pleasure, our pleasure.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So, so for this example, P7, if so, since you are so familiar with it, I don't know if you recall the email communications you've got about the whole like regarding any of the appeal process, most of those were all paper.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. So you get, you get a, a paper letter that's 68, 10 pages long with a, with another four pages of instructions on how to go about, you know, replying to it. So it's, it's, it's a, it's an amazing bureaucratic process, but everything that I've had on my personal story other than my health care has all been by paper mail and I'm not adverse to it. This stuff being by email, it, it will certainly accelerate how you get the information and it'll make it easier for a veteran to share with an advocate who's helping them with their claim. So right now, you can go into the VA portal, the VA dot gov and pull down a lot of these letters. And so I have to talk to people who may not know how to use va dot gov about how to get there and what to do to help them with their process.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Well, let's say that you got all of this in, in an email. And
1. **Participant 07:**
1. so is this, is this in an email to, to, you know, my personal email or in a in a email that directs me back to the portal to look at this?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So you're getting an email to your whatever email you have on file to receive communications. Ok. Yeah, so your personal email and let's say that decision was made on this appeal and you get an email about that fact that a decision was made. What would you expect that email to contain?
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Yeah, I would expect to see what, what both of these have is a link to sign into.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Oh, wait, sorry P7. This is the, this is the old I know, I know, I know, I know but I'm just using this as an example, both of these direct you to a secure link.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. So these direct you to a secure link. So I, I think that needs to be, I I certainly don't want this open air all of this hippa stuff and everything else, right? So so what I what I would hope is that what we're doing is dealing with a story that directs me to a secure website, like these debt management ones do to be able to get to the real story. So, all of this stuff gets to be, you know, hi, a sensitive personal and, something that could be compromisable because, you might call somebody either DOD or VA who asks what's your va percentage as a security question? Ok. So, so I, I know this isn't the email you're talking about. But what I'm saying is what you have on these becomes significantly important, to direct you to the right place to get to the story. So again, a claim number or a or a case number, a personal salutation to me rather than just veteran and a website to go to, to be able to look at that secure information. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Do you wanna go ahead and share? So I don't know if this is also helpful to know, but the emails that we're sharing with you, these, these are actual, we didn't write these, these are actual emails that are being sent right now.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. So this is a new system. Yeah, this, this is pretty cool. I appreciate being on the front end of this because this is, this is not my experience, but it certainly looks good. So, all right. So the, the 827, 1000 number is the, is the cue for any va claim to call. The this website knocks you to one thing and you've got a docket number on the top. So let me read it real quick, issued a decision you'll be sent to your representative. Please do not reply. Ok, great. That's a send only email, if you wish to contact the VBA VA contact your VSO. SO should be VSO. Everybody knows the term veteran service organization is VSO. Not so, so that, that's something you should really emphasize should be corrected because nobody says so we say VSO, does that make sense? Yep. OK. That's a, that's if you're just talking about a address it up properly, that's a critical one because otherwise it's done wrong. All submissions have the claim and then we've got how to do it in a fax and a process. And then the, the moniker about everything. This is actually pretty good except for VSO. I like, I like everything that, that they've got on here. This is pretty comprehensive again with my name on it, not just veteran.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. OK. So the personalization
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Personal is it, it's, to me personally shows my docket number, shows where to go on the secure website, shows how to contact BVA and has the crisis information as well.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. I, I like it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Great.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Great. Yeah, VSO VSO though.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, good to know. We will definitely send that up. That's a really good call out Ian. Did you have any further questions on this one before we do the next one, P7, let's say for our next scenario that you submitted a document to the va electronically and something went wrong in the back end like a system error or something like that and it caused the document that you submitted to not get filed and then you receive an email. What kind of information would you hope that that email would contain?
1. **Participant 07:**
1. You, you're saying that there was a failure.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. Yeah, like something like maybe went wrong like technically in the background and, and whatever you had submitted didn't get filed. So you're getting an email about that.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Ok. So, so there you submitted something but it wasn't properly received and they, and they know it wasn't properly received. Mhm. Yeah. Wow. Well, that's nice to know. Please resubmit and you can either do it by fax or by, by you know, by the portal. And yeah, there should be something about timeliness. There should be if you are on a timeline, there should be a an extension of the timeline since it, it was a IT failure, not necessarily a failure of the veteran to, to try to send it forward and it looked like it went forward. So, yeah, I think that's probably the, it's all, it's all about time in this story. Ok. So I always advise people to make sure if you're doing an appeal or a resubmission that it's all done within 30 days.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, Ian, do you wanna share the email?
1. **Participant 07:**
1. A Here we go. It's personally personally named
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. And just let me know when you need to scroll.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. It's a, it's a long one
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Issue which may have resulted in a failure to establish a claim based on your past submission. Your case was identified as part of a review if this is not quite what I thought you said it was, this is a little different story. What actions VA we're conducting a thorough review to determine if there's any impact, no actions needed to respond to any correspondence. Please keep, are, are, are, are you guys va employees or veterans? Ok.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. I'm, I'm a navy brat. My parents work.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Ok. Awesome. Well, thank you. Thanks for all your, all your travels with that. So, so, hey, so, so this isn't quite the way I read it. This isn't quite the story that you told me. This is, more like what I would call a denial letter than a then a an error in responding from what I see in the top. So I guess you can move down to. So stop at the gray box. Only move as far as the start of the gray box. Ok. Find a local accredited rep see they see us as veteran service organizations. So that's what we it's the whole thing is VSO not just so a regional office website question phone number compensation pension crisis line, yeah, so what this looks like to me is it, is there more? Is that it? Yeah. Ok. Ok. So this looks like a denial letter to me. This looks like if you go back to the top, this looks like a failure to establish a claim. So what what we've got is you provided some evidence but not enough evidence. And therefore the claim was not accepted or like in my case, I submitted everything and the va just didn't read it, you know. So so that, that one that I explained that went from not service connected to 60% was one where, oh yeah, I guess you did give us everything, sorry, we didn't read it, you know. So, so that was that was sort of the story there. But this, this to me is it looks like normal normal action. I'm not sure I like no, no action is needed from you at this time. I would rather it said in, in order to appeal this claim or in order to process the claim, please do X If you I, I think, I think that I don't like that no action is needed from you at this time because basically, that's only if you're gonna walk away. And what I believe happens more often than not with veterans is that, veterans will, in good faith submit something and then get something like this and go screw it. It doesn't matter. I can't, can't get there anyway. They don't care. And so, this is one of the biggest problems and it sounds like, from what I heard from the three star general just talking when I got my award is up to 70% of veterans fall into category where they would have done nothing or received a letter like this with no, with no benefit attached to it. So, occasionally when I talk to people, there's no benefit that they can apply for. They don't have a service connected injury. They don't have a circumstance where they can make an application. But a lot of them, the claim is very complex. They were in a nuclear submarine exposed to radiation and now they've got to be able to justify, you know, a radiological malady, you know, a cancer or something and they have to try to backwards prove this. So, there are, there are a lot of complex stories with claims. And, and not many fall into the category of presumptive like now the Packed Act and Burn pits. I'm obviously, you know, out there in the middle of nowhere. So I'm a burn pit guy and now I don't have to prove, if I wasn't 100% I wouldn't have to prove that my, my issues tied to burn pit maladies are something that I was at this spot at this time because I can just say I was in Afghanistan at this time and, you know, I was in, in these remote, sf, bases, special forces bases. So I don't have to go beyond that to say that I was standing at the burn pit breathing this in every day or on this day. You know. So it, but th this is, this, this doesn't look like a, an administrative or an it failure. This looks like a, a review of the case didn't have enough information to be able to validate the claim.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. Hey, P7, I just wanna, be mindful of your time. We are 15 minutes over. Are you good with? Ok. All right, cool. Because we still have a few more to go.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. I'm helping you. And I'm sorry that I am more knowledgeable and therefore taking longer, but hopefully I'm providing value.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah. No, this is if every participant could, could be as knowledgeable as you. We would be very, very lucky. Oh, sorry. That's my dog Howling.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. No problem. Anyway, in, in, in general, the one thing that I would like to do is be able to have follow on or further participation if needed, if there was some way to do that because of the level of expertise I have in these issues.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah, I, I'm not sure how that would work but, but we'll definitely keep that in mind.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, definitely.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Yeah. Go, go ahead. Do you have another story? I do.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Unless there's anything else we want to talk about on this one.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. No, I just didn't like no action is needed. I think that, you know, that's just a throwaway. I, I wouldn't even put that on the letter. I would, I would say if you feel, if you feel you have more information, if you feel this was derived in error, you know, please do this. I, I wouldn't, I wouldn't, certainly wouldn't start with no action as needed, on, on it because that's kind of kind of been the, the traditional problem with a lot of veterans who, who haven't done anything because they just feel the va isn't concerned and that's not true. The va is a very, very caring agency from my perspective.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yep. Agree.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So our next email type that we're gonna be talking about, you've actually already showed us one that you received. So I know that you're getting them. And I don't know if there's any we're gonna be talking about appointment reminders. So, you know, having already seen that you receive them, and you know, what details are contained in them. Is there anything that you wish it also had or didn't have?
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Or if you, if you bring it up you'll notice that it's, it says the date and time and I think, like, which medical facility, but it doesn't say anything beyond that. And what I would, what I would like is if it said which clinic, I mean, it doesn't have to say what malady. But if it says going to, you're going to ENT you're going to dermatology, you're going to, you know, to sleep, you're going to you know, car cardiac. If it, if it would just say what you're, where you're going, you go, oh yeah, that's the appointment because when it doesn't say where you're going and you don't remember, you get to the hospital and you go, can you help me figure out where I'm going? So, so that, that gap is, that would be if, if I owned the system and have the magic wand, I would at least write the clinic that you're tied to on these appointment reminders.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Well, now you're speaking Ian's language with the Magic wand. Well, why don't we go ahead and share and I just want to also because I know that you are receiving these emails right now. This might look a little different than the one that you're used to seeing. But, but it's one that's in the works right now.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. So it says it says the update, which is great.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. It, it, it says what to do. It, it gives the Coronavirus update. That's fine if you slide down a little bit, slide down to the gray box again. It tells you, tells you what hospital you're going to Salt Lake V Max, Salt, Salt Lake City, medical center, but it doesn't remind you which clinic and if you'll notice when it says clinic contact information, unless the clinic is this specific number for both in mine, it just gives me the generic switchboard number of the hospital. So even if I call it in, I have to then get routed to somebody in appointments who can look up my appointment and go. Oh yeah. This one's ENT, you know.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yep.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So would there be so
1. **Participant 07:**
1. I would like it, I can't tell in this because the number is the same in both, but I would like it to be the specific clinic that you're going to.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. And I would like to have that clinic named Ent Ophthalmology, dental lab, you know, dermatology, podiatry, you know, whatever I would like to have that, that level of detail. It doesn't have to say why I'm going to podiatry. But it, if it said podiatry, then I go. Oh yeah. And then I need to remember to bring this, this and this because it has to do with all this stuff that I'm doing that has to do with that. So it reminds me of additional things I might not think to bring when it tells me which clinic it is.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. As far as the rest of the information on here, does it feel appropriate? Is there anything that,
1. **Participant 07:**
1. It, it, it, it's pretty generic. It's the gray box. That's the most important part. That's the focus that has to be able to tell the, the specifics and, and so the real clinic by name and the real clinic by phone number, not the generic phone number for the clinic or for the hospital switchboard. And what I get I think is the generic phone number for the switchboard.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, Ian, do you have any further questions on this one?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah. No, that was great, great feedback.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. Yeah. So moving on to the next email type, we're talking about your va profile and have you ever received an email that something on your va profile needs to be updated?
1. **Participant 07:**
1. I don't think so. Yeah, I I don't think so. Yeah, we can just go to the email and then we can comment on it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. Yeah. Well, before we go to it is if you did have something you needed to update and you got an email about it, what kind of information would you want to see in that email also?
1. **Participant 07:**
1. We're talking about address number. I guess that would be mainly mainly it, it depends we, our VBA thing. I guess it depends on who's sending the email. So, I guess I check. Is it a VBM? Email? Email?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. You just did the audio just dropped out for a second. There. Was that, what was the last, last thing you said? Which?
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Yeah, it is part of the va, is that update, is it, is it benefits or is it, health because it would be a different, a different status or a different responsibility? But I would think that would be being updated would be phone numbers or address unless you are 40% or below. And then it might be a thin, so there's only a few different things you need to get
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. P7 just so, you know, I think your audio is coming through a little strange, almost like robotic and I, I'm not sure.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. I don't even know how to fix it, but if we need to ask you to repeat something, that's why something got glitchy. Ok. Ian, do you wanna go ahead and share the email and then P7 just tell us what you're, you think about it? Ok.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Ok. So this looks like big va this is a veteran experience office which hopefully is managing this at VA dot gov. So this looks like what we're trying to do with a system wide process. So, I, I can't remember the term, there's a business term now for all lines of effort, but this is kind of a a process that should cross lines of effort, which has been a problem you can update in VBA but it doesn't update in VHA. And so I appreciate VA dot gov to try to cross lines of effort. So I think this is great. It, it looks looks comprehensive to me.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Ian Any further questions on this one? Yeah. No, no. Yeah. We have two left. The next one is kind of niche. So if you've not actually received one, we'll probably just skip it. But however, filed a notice of disagreement with the va I'm familiar with them.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. I, I I don't remember if that's what I actually did. I may have in my in my process or I may have just refiled a brand new claim because I was within a set time period and I kept it moving along. So from the 70% to the 100% was 55 iterative processes and I may have just filed a new claim because I did it timely. It still went back to my retirement date, but I'm very familiar with notice of disagreement because again, this is what I help with older or longer term, separated veterans to do.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. OK. Let's see here. Let's say that you receive an email about a notice of disagreement that you filed? What kind of information would you expect to be in that message that it articulates which particular disability issue we're tied to a timeline to respond a process that the va is gonna use and then the choices that I have up the line to adjudicate it. Ok. Ians gonna go ahead and share that one now notice.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Ok. Date If you have a question, yeah, see I would like, I, I wouldn't like just the date submitted. I would like respond by no later then to be on this because what happens is if you, if you have a response, you have to do they all have a a deadline and, and so if you, if you are already, you've already got your stuff in and no further action, this is one where you should have we have it no further action required at this time. This is just information only or we've got your information and we require a ABC D in addition. Does that make sense? Mhm.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yep. Yeah. Yeah.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. So kind of niche but kind of important. Yeah, absolutely.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Think, I think the, the reason we don't cover it with a lot of the other users is because it's niche, there's not an expectation of what should be in the email. So there, you know, so that's really helpful that, that you have experience with this and that, that, that is a specific thing that you'd like to see. So
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Yeah, so so either we have everything we need nothing else, no nothing else required at this time or you need to submit these things by this date.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Ok this is our last one and it's regarding VA Life Insurance.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Ok, I have I have VA Life Insurance.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, perfect. Have you ever received an email from them?
1. **Participant 07:**
1. No paper statements, paper statements.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Yeah and and then I, I either didn't get the last one or I lost it and then I talked to somebody who sent me a new one. But again, I mean, this is great if we're moving to a position where you can get this stuff all by going to the website or by, by having it be automated. It's a lot less easy to lose the automated stuff than it is the, the paper and, maybe the paper is not nearly as efficient. So, yeah, I would, I would be happy to have an automated, capability on this. Cool.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Well, let's say that you will receive an email and let's say that a change was made to your va Life insurance and, and you, you get an email, what would you want that email to contain or to tell you?
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Well, I don't expect a change to be made. So if, if somebody is making a change then that's a problem because my, my, my insurance is, is a static deduction for a period of time for, for a benefit that will mature at a point. And so, I would be very worried if I got something that said I needed a change. I think most va life insurance policies are a fire and forget kind of thing, meaning they there shouldn't be changes or updates other than what you had just recently with, please update your phone number, your email address or your mailing address. So I'm not, I'm not sure that there should be anything but what I do expect, I do expect it to direct me to a link where I can look at view, manage, determine if I've taken a loan against the policy or if the policy is maturing as, as designed and you know, know what the policy does and how it's working. So just the normal information, but again, this should direct me somewhere to a secure part of the website, not, not really on the, on the email. So, let's say, for example, you're now automating and you're not gonna send me paper statements anymore. You send me an email saying, hey, va is updated, we're not gonna send paper statements anymore. This is how you will get your, your statement information from now forward and then it would direct me to the website where I can review and view my annual annual statement.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok? So let's say this is the message that you receive that something has changed doing.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Yeah, see that's, that's pretty good. And then, and then if you're just changing the system and now we're gonna do this by email. Just a preface that we are, we are moving away from paper statements and this is where we want you to go to review that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, wonderful. do you have any further questions?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. No. Yeah, thats it P7 before we wrap.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Is there anything else that you wanna share with us that we didn't already cover?
1. **Participant 07:**
1. No, I think this is good. I you didn't cover these big newsletter things very much. But remember I told you Saint Cloud Minnesota VA is the gold standard for VH A newsletters. And I found out that I had some medical equipment that had a problem, not from my servicing VA, but from receiving that Saint Cloud Va newsletter and that was both great and disconcerting that my medical center didn't inform me of something that I should have known much more rapidly than I otherwise would have known it. So, I think I've hopefully been of, of value to you and service to you and I stand by to help to help if you need to contact me or if there's anybody who would want follow on contact about this. But I applaud, I applaud that this is all happening. I think this will be much better emails to say generically, we're moving to to email contact and website contact on when you get an email from us. It will be to do this and that at this for that website, you know, just sort of generically is, is a great thing.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Thank you so much. We appreciate your feedback more than you could possibly imagine. So, just so many like nuggets of wisdom and heroes we're going to need like, yeah, it's going to be amazing and it's going to help us so much. So, thank you so much and this was a unique experience.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah, your level of knowledge is really impressive and super helpful.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Ok. Well, hopefully the va the va knows it or learn it or, or be able to use it too because I I try to be as valuable and assisting to the va as possible. I've got a cousin who works for the Minneapolis Medical Center and you know, we talk about some of the problems as a VH a employee as well. So, all the way around the corner here.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yep. Awesome. Well, I hope you enjoy the rest of your day and again. Congratulations on the award. Yeah.
1. **Participant 07:**
1. Ok. Thank you. Thanks for your time. Thank you.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Take care. Bye now.
1. 
1. **Participant 08:** INTERVIEW
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Can you, first off, can you tell me, what branch of the military you served in?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. I served in the navy? Ok. Well, first I served in the army and then I went to the navy.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Impressive, nice, nice. I'm a, I'm a, I'm a navy brat myself. Never served but both my parents did. So, you know, so when did you, retire or separate?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. I, separated in 2007.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Great, great, great. Ok. Since retiring or separating, have you, or do you currently receive, emails from the VA?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. I do.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, great. I, are there, what are the ones, that, that, that come to mind? Like the types of emails?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. It's the one I think that, minority women. And then, I think it says, V va, experience or something to that effect. And, what, and I think from VA dot gov, like if you know, important things come. Mhm.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Any, any examples you have of, of important things going on at the VA A?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Like, I get, doctor's appointments, different stuff of that nature. Like, using the VA app to, access my medication and look at my appointments. I look at that, I look at the VA dot gov app on my phone every day.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Oh, nice. Ok.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Yeah, I look at it every day because I have to remind myself and I'm so glad that they made the app. Yeah, because I, I, I'm a very forgetful person. I could be doing something one moment and then it'd be like, what was I just doing it? Take me a minute to figure it out.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Oh, sure. Sometimes I walk into a room and I'm like, wait, what, why, why did I go in here? So yeah, relatable, relatable. Ok, great. So, so what we're gonna do today is we're going to we're gonna have you look at a couple of different more than a couple types of emails and ask you what you know what your about your experience with these types of emails and or you know what you might expect in, in a particular type of email. So the first type we're gonna talk about our our debt emails. Have you ever had received or do you have experience with receiving an email about a debt from the va a debt from the va?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Mhm. I don't, I don't remember. No.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. No worries. No worries. Let's say you let's say you did receive a debt email from the va what, what sort of information would you expect that email to contain, what would be useful to you? What would you want to see in that email?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. How, how I, how I became to all that debt? Mhm. And who is collecting that debt? Mhm. And wait a minute. No, I did, I didn't receive like they I don't know if this is the same thing but like I had to do a child support payment and they sent me some what's the name about that? But that's been like maybe like three or four years ago. Actually, no, it wasn't three or four years ago. Might have been more like I would say close to 10 years.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Yeah, I don't know if that's the same debt thing we talk about, right?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. It's, it's similar, it's similar. All right. Well, I'm gonna have my colleague Elissa show share her screen and show you an example of a debt email. And if you could just tell us what and are you're able to, you it's you're able to read it on your screen?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Yes.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, great. And just tell us you know your impressions of this email and if there's anything else you might, you might want to see in this email or if this is or if this is sufficient.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. This this would be let me see, this would be sufficient because you don't want all your information to get out and they put it into a link so you can access it, access it and still maintain privacy. Yep, that makes sense.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. If you, if you got this email, what, what sort of action if any would you take?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. If I got this e if I got this email, I would click on the link and look through it and then if I, if I don't recognize what's up there, I'm giving the va a call and see what they know about it. Mhm.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Ok, great. Elissa, do you have any any follow ups on that? All right. So the next type of email is, oh my gosh, you know, you're right. I missed the part. So it's my fault. Thank you, Elissa. So let's say after receiving this email, you received another email, which will show you and let us tell us what you know what your impressions are or what you would do if anything.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah. And this other one comes just shortly after that first one. So what we're seeing here is this top one is the first one you received and the bottom one is the new one.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Ok. I get that a little bigger here.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Debt management. So three song and she does. So the seed and water. This is a pretty good email as well. Yeah, this is, this is a pretty good email right here. But I think I like the first one better.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Can you tell me about it? Tell me, can you tell me why?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. I could tell you why? Because it has debt management and you never know, you know, people walking by looking and seeing what's on your screen and you just randomly looking at some of you like debt or she or debt, then it, then the gossip go around the office.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Sure. Sure. Sure. I get that. I get that. Yep. Yep. So, so yeah, so, so privacy is, is important to you?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right, cool.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Elissa. Any, any follow up questions on this.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah. If we were to tell you that these aren't two different, they're like actually different messages for two different things. Like the first one is for a copay for like let's say like you go to the doctor's office and you owe a copay for that and then the second one is for an overpayment that the va has overpaid on a benefit and you will have money for that. What do you think about the messages now?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Oh, yes, I know that second will make my stomach drop. Yeah. Sure. And the first one and the first one, if it's a copay and you click on the link, you click on the link and stuff and you know, you get your information or what have you. I would probably just go ahead, click on it and if I owe it, I'm gonna pay it. And the second one, like I said, will make my stomach drop. I got a debt and you owe the va some money. Mhm. They saying that they overpaid you and you didn't know it. Oh my God. That would, that would, that's devastation right there.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yep.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. So understandably. And a question for you then knowing what you now know about these messages, is there any additional information? I know privacy was a big is a big concern and something that you care about having said that is there anything that you would want this email to have to maybe better inform you as to what's happening, what they're requiring?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Well, I mean, it's good information to send out and things and you click the link and all. That's all I'm really getting from it really.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Ok. All right. Thank you.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. So this, oh, sorry, go ahead.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. They give you more information. Well, each from each one they say you will receive a statement and that's, you know, that comes through the mail for both of them, you will receive a statement and that way you can look to see the breakdown of what you owe or whatever copay you need. Yeah, it's very, to me it's very informative. It doesn't have like it's not over giving information.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yep.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Oh, and they say don't reply to the email hit va dot gov on each one of them.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yep. Ok. Well, thank you for that. The, the, the next one we're gonna look at, have you ever appealed, a decision, like a claims decision, for example, at the V you know, with the va
1. **Participant 08:**
1. I try, I, tried to but I, ended up selecting the wrong thing from what I was told.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. OK.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Or from what information that they sent me. So, they're telling me that something wrong was done and the decision that they had gave me. So now I have to wait to see what that decision is in order to know, you know, in order to know what's going on.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. OK. Yeah. All right. Well, let's see. All right. So shall we show the, show the example? Here's a, here's a current example of a letter, where a decision on your appeal has been made and this is the communication that they, they send you just, you can read through it and, and think aloud, you know, it, you know, as, as thoughts come to you while you're reading it, please feel free to, to, to talk, you know, talk out loud about what you're saying and just let us know your impressions and, and if this is, this is what you'd like to see, OK, to check the appeal status visit.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Mhm. Or call. And they give you, they give you the hours when, the va opens and closes, that will be sent to you and your re representative if you have one shortly. Ok. And it tells you you can't reply to this email. It's used for sending messages instead of receiving. Mhm. If, if you wish to contact the Veterans Appeals Board or submit a statement, please work with your service officer or representative. If you have one, all submissions, all admissions must include the veteran's name and claims file number and can be submitted to the male effects. Yeah. Ok. So I think again, I don't see any over usage and one important thing I do see is the crisis number and the E and the link you can go to. And yeah, so that's the one important, very important thing and they send you to where you can mail the correspondence to, then you can click on. Then if you like a computer person, you could click on the link and see everything, whatever status and possibly possibly I I'm not even sure if you can appeal that decision if it's not in your favor. Ok. Yeah, but they give out it. It's giving out good information. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So after, after, after reading this, what, what questions do you have about the decision on your appeal?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. I don't think I have any questions for this one? It's short and sweet and so the point.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, great. Awesome. All righty. Moving along a Elissa. Did you have any follow ups on that? No. Ok, great. All right. Have you ever uploaded evidence for say a claim or anything? Have you ever uploaded a file to VA dot gov? Ok. Has it ever, has it ever gone wrong? Like, has it ever errored out or, or has it ever resulted in it not completing?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Well, when I did the appeal everything went through. Ok. Yeah, everything went through when I did the appeal.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Well, let's say you tried to upload something to VA dot gov and something went wrong and the va sent you an email explaining that something had gone wrong. What would you expect to see in that email?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Somewhere where I can access it to get straight to the problem information, you know, like like who I can call to fix it and mhm.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. And that cycle thing.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Yeah. Ok, great. We're gonna show you an example of, of one of those emails and get your impression.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Oh, also this is a pretty long email and it doesn't all fit on the screen. So when you get down to the bottom and you're ready for me to scroll, just let me know.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Ok. I've received this email myself. It looks familiar to an email that I received.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, it's, it's highly likely that you could have received this. So, yeah.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Yeah. Yeah, I've received because it says what actions is the VA taking? What should you do? Oh, yeah, I've received this, this email because it says, no action is needed response to any correspondence that the va is sending for asking for additional information. Mhm. It said please keep our address and phone number updated.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? That's a typo, it's, it's supposed to be, please keep your address and phone number.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. They forget what we did.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. We a eagle eyes over here. Good catch.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Yeah, no action. Ok. They're telling you, you can go back to, you can call them if you need assistance. Yeah. Yeah, so I'm done with the bottom. Ok. Oh, yeah. Ok. So it gives you different regional offices, different regional office locations? Oh. Oh, they gotta ask Va dot gov that's something like a, you can type on it and, and, submit your questions to them. Mhm. S VA dot gov. Oh, that's good. By mail compensation claim department. The Mill Pension Claim Department of Veterans. Did they give the, crisis hotline? And I like it that says thank you for your service. This one right here it recognizes that we're service members and you could just be stro scrolling through an email and you see that and that. Oh, I'm a little bit happier now, you know, that somebody recognizes my service.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. A all right. Well, so on balance this, this email, this is, this is what you would expect.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Yep.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, great. All righty. So the next, the next type of email we're gonna ask you about is an appointment, reminder email. Have you ever received an appointment reminder email?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. In the mail on a, on, the computer? Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Ok, great. And, if you were, if you were to receive an email, appointment reminder, what would you want that to, to contain?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Who the appointment is with? What time it is? What service, you know, at the hospital? Where am I going in the hospital? Yeah. And, and whether it's a virtual or not or? Huh. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, great. Yeah. All right. So we're gonna show you an example of a, of a current, appointment reminder email and just let us know, if it meets muster or if there's anything, anything else you'd want to see in this email? And this is, like, the, the other one, this one's a bit long. So just let Elissa know when, when you need to us to scroll, to see the rest of it.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Yeah. So they're telling you if, if you've made changes, any changes you or the va staff have made since then, are not included in this letter. So they all had to send or update it. Poet. So before your appointment, call to validate date and time, date, time and type of appointment, telephone video in person, range of health insurance information you may have to, you may have access to schedule or cancel a va appointment online. Yeah, I have, I've ha I've had to do that and that, that particular system that needs to be updated a little bit or upgraded or what have you because I've been through this to where I canceled an appointment and they still called me. I was like, I thought y'all got the cancellation.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Gotcha.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. What have you but luckily some of some of my doctors and stuff, I have their phone numbers and I could, you know, hey, I'm texting you got an emergency. You can't make this appointment. What have you? Yeah, I like that. Ok. Yeah, they if you got Coronavirus, same thing applies. Mhm. You either got to call somebody cancel the appointment. They want you to consider changing it to a Telehealth. Mhm. And that's good because you know you sick, you got Coronavirus. You ain't, you know, going around spreading it to people that don't want it or
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Nobody wants that. Right?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Yeah, some of your appointments may not be viewable date, time shown. Your appointments below reflects the time zone where your appointment is scheduled so they giving you time zone information on the time on your end. That's a plus. Ok, I'm, I'm done. Ok. Upcoming. Ok. What the, clinic contact information I would because the VA they go by extensions, I would have the extension to get to the proper place. But sometimes you call it when it, you call it, the help desk or what have you and that's like they sending you to the wrong people when you say one thing and you're like, ok, well, I just dial the extension then you'll know right off hand. Ok. Hit this number, dial the extension and that's that, view the claims where you are scheduled and other details of your appointments. Ok. You have a question. Mhm. And then it could be ok. So why they have MST up here and MT MDT down here?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Right. So, you know what? I actually had the exact same question earlier today. I thought it was a mistake but it's, the, the appointments are at different times and it's, it's a mountain daylight MDT is mountain daylight time where MST is Mountain Standard time. So that's kind of tricky because it's a different, you know, different time of year, different time, you know, different, different actual hour.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Huh. Yep. Yeah. No, they shouldn't have to try to figure this out whether it's, it's, two different time zones. Yup. Yeah, they shouldn't have to try and figure that out. They don't get confused. Like what, what's going on.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Right.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Yep. View the clinic where you are scheduled and all the details of your appointments. Oh, it tells you to go to, my healthy vet. Yeah, that's my favorite, my healthy vet right there. That's my favorite place to go and get. Yeah, get, the, get care tale and then, then the, one where you got your labs and all of that, do my favorites. Nice. Yeah, change your appointment. See the change your appointment thing. It didn't work, it didn't work for me. They were calling out. I thought I scheduled online. No, it didn't come through here. Well, let's add an appointment then.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yup. Yeah, great. So, so does this, does this email meet your, your expectations or is, does it leave you with any questions? I know you, I mean, other than what you've already mentioned, like, you know, listing the, the, the specialty and you know, where the, where, you know, where it's and the, I'm sorry, did you say, did you say the doctor? You didn't, you didn't say the doctor, did you?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Well, I mean, hold on. It It could, you know, it could be the doctor that you could add to it too. That way it's not, you know, they know they're going to the, the, the medical, the VA medical center in Salt Lake City they know that part. But where, but we're exactly in the hospital. Yeah. I think they need to give that part. Sometimes they get a doctor, sometimes they do give the doctor's information. Mhm. Yeah. But other than that, yeah. Ok, great. Other than that it's, it's a good email.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, cool. All righty. So, moving on to the next one. have you ever received, an email from the va about updating, your contact information?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. I have.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Can you, can you tell us about that?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Let me see. They, I think sometimes they send it to you in the mail, they send it to you in the mail, they'll send it to your email and I just me, I just ignore it because my information is the same. I don't plan on moving but I will know I will, if it's a link in there or what have you saying, hey, up your date, your information and I know I'm moving then I'll go ahead and click in and do all, do everything it needs to be done.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Ok, great. So let's say you got the following email. What, what if anything, would you do, confirm your mailing address, address on file with va oh, this person the in they say was unable to deliver and return.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Yeah, they need to go and update the email, please sign in it. Yeah. Yeah, they need to go and update because they can miss vital information off of this part alone if they, you know, just ignored it or whatever. Ok. What? Yeah, it gives you sign in what do you need to do now? Yeah, go ahead. Sign in your profile and change it up and at least they give you the directions on you know how to get there and where you're gonna go. Mhm. How we use this address? The address in your va file health care compensation, pension claims appeals and Vrne. Mhm.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So let's say like like you said, you haven't, you haven't moved anywhere and you're not planning on it. Let's say you logged in and you followed the link and you logged in and you checked your information and your mail address that was on file with the VA was correct. What would you do then?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. I would just say what information I had in Dale and keep it moving.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right, great. All righty. So the last one we're gonna show you today is related to life insurance. Have you ever have you ever received communications from the VA about life insurance?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. I don't think I have, I may have, I'm like, oh, I don't remember that one.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right, let's say you had a policy a life insurance policy with the VA and you, you updated you, you updated something with that policy and you got an email shortly after making that update, what would you expect to see in that email?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. What would I expect to see in that email? Hm, if I, I would look through it to see, you know, if it applies to me or if, you know, I would have to wait, whether it applies to me, whether I got enough money to support it. Mhm. And if it's interesting, I'll follow whatever steps it tell me to take.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, great. All right, let's say you you made a change to your policy and you received the following email.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Huh. You have new va life insurance documents to review. Well, we we recently process a change to your va life account if you did not initiate this request or if you wish to update how you receive communication, it gives you the 800 number to call. Mhm. So look my g I will be calling that the 800 or clicking on the link. If I'm at a computer, I'll click on the link. Ok. But if I'm on my phone and I seen the email through my phone, I'll call the number.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, great.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Really informative about yeah, real informative about receiving your documents and everything.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Mhm. Right. It's, it's nice to have a confirmation. Right.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Is there, is there anything else you would want to see in this email?
1. **Participant 08:**
1. Oh, no, it all Right.

1. Thank you. All right, take care, take care.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. You have a good one.
1. **Participant 08:**
1. You too. All right, bye bye.
1. 
1. **Participant 09:** INTERVIEW
1. 
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. Just to kinda get, get to know you a little bit. Can you tell us what branch of the military you served in?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. The army
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And when did you retire or separate?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Actually, I'm still in.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Oh, ok. Do you currently receive any emails from the va
1. **Participant 09:**
1. I do
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Which ones do you, do you happen to recall? Which types of emails or that you receive from the va currently?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Mostly it's about, filing for claim for, I think the Pact Act. Mostly just notifications for my, appointments.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And can you tell me a bit about your experience with these emails?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. I usually just glance over them and delete them.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And when you're glancing over them, do you feel that you are, getting the appropriate amount of information? Do they seem clear? Do the, the amount of emails you're getting seem appropriate?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. I will usually delete, if it doesn't pertain to me in any way, if it's usually just general information, excuse me, I deleted it. But, sometimes I click on the links because I am a caregiver for my father as well who is a veteran and he doesn't always, you know, when I'm looking for Vietnam or burial services, I just glance at it and then move on but usually stuff about politics and, you know, stuff that's going on in Congress, I believe because I don't have time for that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Gotcha. So, do you receive as a caregiver, for your father? Do you receive emails regarding? I don't know anything that you need to do as a caregiver?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. I do not, now
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. My father received his own email.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Got it. Ok. And how do you prefer the va communicate with you? Like for example, emails and text messaging letters and
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Usually it's emails and text messaging because I don't always have time to pick up phone calls on my schedule.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. All right. Well, to get started, we're gonna go through sort of a, a very similar discussion series. We're gonna show you existing email types that the va currently sends out and prior to showing you the email, we're gonna kind of get an idea of if you have experience receiving that type of email and what your expectations would be for, what would be in that email. And then so we're gonna go through a, a handful of those. So it, it might feel slightly repetitive for each one, the questioning, but it you know that what you expect for each kind of thing. It varies, right? So
1. **Participant 09:**
1. I'm just gonna grab my water real quick.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, absolutely.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Sorry about that. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. So we're gonna jump into the first one and I was curious if you could tell me about your experience receiving any debt related emails from the va ok,
1. **Participant 09:**
1. well, I actually happen to have received any debt emails.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok? If you did receive something regarding a debt in an email, what kind of information would you hope to see in that email?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Probably something related to some debt relief or some kind of? Well, no, I'm different than people nowadays of applying for jobs, you know, in case you know they're unemployed and possibly a a reference to local facilities within where where I'm located.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, let's say this one was specific to a debt that you owed to the va like you would incur some debt from a benefit or utilizing health care service or something like that and they're letting you know that that you owe money. What would you expect in that type of email?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. knowing that, a phone number to call for services or any questions about my bill or working debt relief plan with the office.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Alright, so Ian is gonna share an email example and let's say that you receive this email. First of all, are you able to see this? Ok, and read it.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. I am. Yes.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, great. So let's say that you receive this email. What do you think it's about? And is there anything that you would do from here?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Well, this space is seeing this kind of e email. I would know that this is probably a secure document and that I have to go to a secure page to view this document.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. How, how do you know that it's a secure document?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Well, it, it's my experience because I've done the same thing using government websites. We're not allowed to put pii out to non secured websites. So just tell me that there's some personal information there that you hold on a secured website and looking at the link, it's matched that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Got it. Yeah, that makes total sense. So, receiving this email, What do you think this email is about?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Some debt that I owe
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. So you said you would just to confirm that I heard correctly, you said that you would click on the link and investigate and see what it was about?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Yes, that it would be reviewed to it, but I probably know, wouldn't run in a, in a rush mode because I know to, you know, check the website. But if my father was looking at it, he would probably either think it's scam or spam because the older generations always know or, or always are told, don't click on links that you don't know.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Well, that's, that's good that he actually follows that rule probably keeps me down all the time.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. I'm just being optimistic.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Well, it sounds good. I, I like it.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. He'll call me and say what is this? And then I have to go downstairs and yeah, go check it out.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Well, he's lucky to have you. It sounds like so. Well, let's say so you've, let's say you've just received this email and then shortly after that you receive this next email. Tell us what your thoughts would be and, and for the purpose of this because we're having to compare, we've stacked them. So the one on top is the one that you receive first and then shortly after that is the one you see on the bottom and just kind of give us your impressions and what your thoughts would be.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. If you're the information available from Debt Management Center. I, my first instantly thinking is that you're trying to get people to use the website instead of replying to emails or sending out direct emails to, you know, non secure websites. So, like, II, I view this as like, you know, like a reminder or an SMS text saying, hey, check your email or check this document. So instead of going through the phone, you'll get this in the email.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Ok. All right. So would, would you click on this link and investigate or you would, you just kind of let it go or check, you said on your phone?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Well, if for someone, if I know I'm working through the website, I'm, I'm doing this as a reminder. So it's, it's kind of prompted me to do my steps. So if I didn't have time to, you know, actually go investigate, this would be my, my email reminder and say, hey, I got documents there, go and you gotta remember to go sign them. Ok. So I would click on the link if I had time, you know, sit at the computer and completely the sheets.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So let's add a little more context now and say that the first email is to pay a copay that you've incurred from going to visit a, a va health care facility like a doctor or a specialist or something. And you, you owe a copay on that and that's what that first message is for. And let's say that the second one is an overpayment on a benefit. So for example, if you had like a beneficiary that aged out of a certain benefit, but the va didn't catch it in time. And so you they overpaid you and now you owe them that money back is what the second one is about. What do you think about the level of information and content with that information?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Well, the only thing that could be possibly unclear or questionable in that sense is So the first email it says it's from the VA Health Center. So that could be any information if you're so that, that's pretty much generic. And then you have to investigate, to figure out what it is if they don't know how to read the link, if I didn't know, read the link, I think. Oh, I got something from the VA. Ok. I'll just, I me, I got other things to do instead of just checking the va because I would feel it would be like a spam, you know, vote for your Congress or something like that, you know, an issue or something. Yeah. For the second one being available from Debt Management Center that would, I think it would be insightful to have something in there about veteran medical services or something like that. A more generic title of instead of debt management because debt management could be anything in that sense. So if you're focusing on medical care, I would label it have it be medical care, debt management or something benefit or you know, burial care, debt management or just to be more specific, no one has time. So usually, well, not, not when I have time but you know, once you put debt management, people are gonna instantly click and then they're gonna be deflated when they get in like, oh this is for something dumb that I don't worry about.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Yeah, I got you.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. I mean it's not dumb. But, you know, the, the, the grandparents get over antsy and then I look at, ok, what is my immediate response? What's the risk am I gonna take with this? You know, I, if it's, if it's a medical bills, ok, I'll keep that back in my high back of my mind, but I have other priorities that I have to worry about right now.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. And Michelle just so, you know, dumb is a perfectly acceptable adjective.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. We're interested in your unvarnished opinions. You don't have to. Yeah, so yeah, we're totally here for this. So let it let it rip.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ian, do you have anything further you wanna ask Michelle about for this email type? No, Michelle, is there anything else you wanna share with us before we move on to the next type of email?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. No.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. We're gonna go ahead and just leave these up on the screen for now until we're ready to share the next one. So we're not referring to these at this point. But the next type of email. Have you ever had any experience? Excuse me, appealing a decision from the va regarding your benefits, for example,
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Not yet because I haven't done it. I'm procrastinating. I'm a good procrastinator.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Well, let's say that you finally feel the urge to do it and you, you go ahead and you, you file it and and then a decision has been made and you receive an email about that? What kind of information would you expect to have contained in that email?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. a link of the acceptance of the letter? A reason why? Well, maybe if, if it's a generic email going out saying that we have rejected your letter, but then a link towards a detailed response on why. Yeah, the claim was rejected and a link to rebut it with the process procedures step by step. So what, what needs to be done to rebuke the claim?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. Well, let's say that you, you know, in that same scenario, you appealed a decision and the va has made a decision about it and they've sent you this email. So Ian's gonna share, take a minute to look it over, you know, as you encounter things that make you go, huh? Or yeah, or whatever, you know, kind of think out loud and talk us through your thought process on that sort of things that you might find helpful things that you don't like. Stuff that you wish was here, stuff like that.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. So I would have a question of because I would like to actually talk to somebody who could see the gaps or what I was missing with the claim. I don't know if the, the, the appeal status, if that link would provide that information to do rebuttal.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Oh, yeah, I'm not sure. Is, is that what you would expect or want.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Well, this let's see. Ok. Well, I guess this one would say this is just about the status of your report. Please don't reply to this email. This says nothing about this says nothing about whether you're granted or you're approved or denied. It just says to look for your status. And I think if you wish to contact the board of directors, that's not relevant to checking the status, why would you call the board of directors, contact the board of directors or submit a statement if you just want to sta if you just want a status
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. And how do you feel about the status not being here? Is it OK? That you have to click
1. **Participant 09:**
1. again, you're you're referencing, you're referencing a secure link or secure document that might have pii on it. So to check your check your app, yeah, of appeals issued a decision. Ok. So this one you already appealed. So see, to be easy, the Veterans’ appeals of the decision you will have one shortly to, well, you won't be able to check your sta my my first looking at it is you have to click on this link to check the status because it's on a secure website. I think maybe putting in here that we are sending you to our secure page for privacy purposes. Just an understanding of why a little disclaimer on why you keep sending references to click on the va and not just sending them to their email account like a foreclosure on the bottom links or, you know, using the VA website as a secured or ensures your information is secured and in a protected way or whatever. So, information is will be delivered through using the VA website and not personal emails or, you know, something like that because that would explain why you keep on sending people to the VA claim. So if they actually read the emails, they won't, they won't get flustered. And I'm like, why do they keep on sending me to this website? Well, it's because your secure page, that's why to protect your information, whatever, maybe not everyone knows that, right.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So that's a really good point.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. And, but if you wish to contact the board or appeals, I think that would be on the inside of it's not relevant to this email. This should be in the document where your status is.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So like maybe wherever that link might take you.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Yes, because as, as you read the once you get an answer, then that would be if you want to contact the board, if you're ready to give a phone number, if you wanna check the status.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, I got you.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. And so leave it short and simple to check your status and then leave that bottom portion for the results if they wish to rebut it, you know, results and then if you wish to contact the board about your claims then blah, blah, blah.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Got it. Ok. Is there anything else you wanna share with us about this? Your thoughts on this email?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. If you have one shortly and I'm not sure if that if you have one short, if you have one shortly, if that's really re relevant, the docket number will be sent to you and your representative that you, you don't need if you have one shortly. Ok. If anything, if there you have a timeline like a date, a time stamp date when they will receive the document, that way, I know that it takes three days or three weeks for them to process to see the document, your documents will be ready on 12th November. So I'll know that my that they got my document number, but I will receive it and my representative will receive it on 12 December, but I can check the status now if I wanted to, but I can't get a hard copy or whatever version.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. What if they're unable to provide that date?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Then she give an estimation of two weeks notice and then call or ok, because everyone wants a time time frame because no one can execute anything not having been open ended and shortly it's just not clear enough.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Is that yeah.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Ok. So if not received by this date, please reach out to this number. Ok, to request AAA status or a location status. Or something because whoever reads it and wants the hard copy is gonna be anxious, I would be anxious to know to get the hard copy results so I can move forward with whatever I have to do. Yeah. And then the VA centers don't always have convenient appointments. So you're gonna have to coordinate times like three weeks now and say, hey, this is supposed to be here in three weeks. I want to meet with you in three weeks to go over this at this time.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Oh, that makes a lot of sense. Yeah. Ok. Yeah, because there there would be additional scheduling possibly. Ok. Yeah, Ian, is there anything else you wanna cover before we move to the next one?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. No, tons of great stuff. Thank you.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, yeah. Really, really helpful. So for the next email type, we're gonna talk about like maybe a time where you submitted and, and maybe this has happened or maybe it hasn't, but let's say that you submitted a document to the va and something went wrong like electronically you submitted it and something went wrong, for example, a system error on the back end and it caused the document that you submitted to not be filed and you receive an email. What kind of details would you expect that email to have?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. The name of the document that I sent, who I was sending it to? And what type of error I received and how to remedy it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. Well, let's go ahead and share same scenario and let's say that that this is the email that you receive. Same as the others, you know, take a look at it, you know, as you come across things, if something feels, you know, something you would like, you know, mention that or anything seems kind of out of place or confusing anything like that. Mm.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. I would like to reference what I sent to you and what it seems very vague.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. OK. So when you say reference what you sent, you mean the document that you had uploaded it?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Ok? Because it just says it's sending a letter to an issue identified. I don't know what issue was identified and you guys got so many departments and so many different people to talk to it would be nice to narrow it down.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok? Oh I forgot to mention this is also a really long email so once you get to the bottom, if you wanna just let us know Ian can scroll for you further down. Ok?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. You could scroll it out. Oh, ok. I think that's always, I guess good information to have but the main focus of the you kind of lose the focus of the email by having all that information down there because you don't know if it's for about the compensation claims. You don't know about personal claims because you don't have what the documents, what the email is referencing. Ok. I mean, keeping the veteran crisis in their veteran location, that's a good, that's, you know, a, a standard thing for, if people wanna look for it or be a website.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. So the, the va regional office location and the veteran crisis line that you identified as key pieces to have in these messaging. What was another one that I missed?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Yeah, in the VA website?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Got it. Ian, can you scroll up just a little bit?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Ok. Those are, those are good informative, but this, it's not really a lot of re are relevant to what the email is. The email says that there is an error.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Do you want I to scroll up a little bit more?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Scroll up? Yeah. So if you want to, I guess at the bottom is a lot of needless words and if you said there's an error, then you, you would probably wanna have a link to the website to where that error is or wherever that department that's confirming that error. So, you know what's related to?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, Ian, anything further you wanna talk about on this one?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. No. And Michelle, how are you feeling? Do you feel like we've covered it or is there anything further you want to share?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. I think I, I just think, I think it's wordy. Ok. But other than that, I mean, what you should do? Well, obviously no action needed at this time that's not relevant because obviously there is a problem. So you're gonna have to do an action, respond to correspond to va sends you asking for additional information. That sounds like a rebuttal sense, but the email is not about a rebuttal, it's about a document failed, they identified the problem. Ok? So go to this link to see this problem or call this number, ok?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. That would be the the kind of actions that you would want to see and be able to take.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Yes.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, got it. Alright. Second, I'm sorry you could excuse me. All right. Well, for the next type of email, I'm pretty sure that you will be familiar with it. But let's say that. Well, actually let me start off by asking, have you ever scheduled an appointment at a VA facility? And did you receive any sort of email communication regarding the appointment?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Sometimes? Yes, sometimes. No.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, so some inconsistencies there. Yeah. Ok. And when you did receive them, do you remember having any sort of questions about the content of the email or or feeling that it was like gave you the information you needed or there was anything else you might want? It's ok if you don't recall.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. No, because I just look at the date and the time and make sure I'm tracking. I don't read anything else in the email. It says I have an appointment here. I'm like, ok, I'll track it. Here's the dial A number. Got it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Nice. Ok, perfect. Well, let's say that you received this email about your appointment and it might look a little different than the appointment, reminders you're used to getting. But for the sake of today, let's, let's say that this is what you receive. Are you provided with enough information? And is there anything you might do from here?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Can you slow down? Yes, just go back up. Ok. The only thing that like stumps me a little bit is that you're saying that you have to call to validate the appointment, call your va facility to validate the date time and type of appointment. That is not always easy because some offices have other people making their phone calls like the the doctor. I see he doesn't make his own appointment. So I have to receive a phone call from somebody else. So unless there's like, I can't really call the doctor to call the doctor. I, I called the generic VA and then they have to try to find me to verify the appointment. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So it's just like an overarching, like maybe appointment line that like assists other like all va facilities and then they route you. Is that right?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Well, see that's where you start getting into because I tried to call today to make an appointment and the phone just kept on ringing. Ok. So, and you know, I, I had the time to call this morning and we'll see if I have time to call again later and if I don't have time to call later, I then procrastinated to do it the next day. And then hopefully I get someone online or someone to pick up the line. So, calling to verify is not always going to be an easy process because if they don't pick up the line, then do you consider your appointment verified or not verified if you don't get a confirmation?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. So rather than in, in this instance, rather than call your va facility to validate, is there some other way that would be like more convenient or a way that you would want to do that?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Click the click here to validate because I know if my dad got this email, he would keep on calling and calling and calling until someone picked up and then he'll get me to call like dad, no one's picking up. I don't have time to sit here and wait for someone to pick up. You know, they're busy. I'm busy. Like right before here he had to send an email. I had to go run downstairs and send an email for him because he didn't know how to save. So just a nice click here to validate the appointment so I can just get it done and over with. Ok, and not have to call the facility because that's an extra granted everything takes five minutes but everything takes five minutes and there's not enough hours in a day to just sometimes do the simple things. That is so true.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. It's very true.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. You say it takes five minutes. Well, yeah, so does this and so does this and so does this.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Oh my gosh, truth. Absolutely. Ian, did you have any questions on this?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah. No, I think we covered it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Great. And Michelle anything else you wanna cover before we move to the next one?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. No.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Have you ever received an email from the va that something on your va profile needs to be updated? I think so. Ok. And if you can't recall the contents of that email, you can just kind of speak to what you would want that email to have like to get that point across to you.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Just an email saying that this point that these items need to be updated on your email or on your profile to assist us better in the future, please click on this link to enter to go to your profile and make ma make the appropriate changes.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Perfect. I'm gonna just like write all of that down and use that. That was great. No, it really was, it was like that was that was perfect. Well, let's say in this scenario, the va needs to update or confirm your mailing address and you received this email. What type of questions would you have if you received it? And is there anything that you would do from here?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. I think the email is fine. The only thing that I don't know that's not catchy or what you need, “what you need to do now” is I, I just don't know if that's a, a good header in the sense. You could probably put sign into your va gov profile now or sign in profile, sign, sign in the profile now in that sense as far as being, but that's me being nitpicky in that sense. It's not really a grabber. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All good feedback.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. I, I think it's fine otherwise.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. So it just wasn't immediately obvious like your next steps just from glancing at it.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Yeah, I mean it, it said what it said the next step is please sign in the va va but then that what? And you give the steps to sign into the VA but that, I don't know there's something about that title. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, that's fair. Ian anything you want to cover on this before we go to the next one? Yeah, I was just curious.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. All right. So in this email, the VA has gotten some returned, they try to send you something, it got returned. And so they're saying, you know, le let's have you update your address, let's say you log on and your address is correct. Then what would you do?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. Well, that's a very good question because I would not know what to do because that, I don't know who's sending me something, which office is sending me something or what they're sending me. And, what address did they send to? Did they put the wrong address in? Right. Yeah. And I know, if you want to put a link in there, you know, because of pi, I, well, address is not really api I but if there's a way to see what the mistake is that, that, that, that office put in that they send it to 202 Highland Park Drive instead of 201, right? But my address is correct and they're not correct you, there's gotta be some way to, I don't know, I don't know if it's a systems link. If they, what they use, you know, it could be just fingerprinting finger error. Got you. But if it comes from, it says the V is putting in the va office for that question, putting in the Pacific V VA O office that sent it and their phone number, you could possibly check online. And if that number on the address is correct online, then call the Beo office and say, hey, what number did you put? Because my address is correct in the system? Ok. Ok, awesome, great, nice.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Michelle, we are at time. Ian and I have some time but I want to be mindful of yours. Do you have enough time to stick around for one more email type? It's totally fine if you don't? Ok, thank you so much. We really appreciate that. It's the last one. have you ever received an email regarding VA life insurance?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. You know, I don't know I received me letters. Ok, and I just rip them off.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Well, let's say a change was made to your VA Life insurance and you received an email. What kind of information would you expect that email to contain to let you know that?
1. **Participant 09:**
1. But and I have the a life insurance.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Mhm. You have it in this scenario you have VA Life insurance and a change was made and they're they're emailing you to alert you of that change.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. A notification that your va life insurance number, blah, blah, blah has has updated its terms and policies by to include or to exclude whatever specific wording that have been changed in the document.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. Well, let's say that that this is the email that you receive. Let us know your thoughts.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. I would, I would start off that we recently processed a change to your VA Life account and have the new VA Life insurance documents to review with this. I would start off with we we recently changed. Ok. Depending on what the change is, I mean, I don't know when you click on this link, if it gives you a cover page of what the, what the change in the document is or change insurance, either, you know, if you click on the link and then it comes with a cover page saying, hey, we changed this and it gives you the list of the changes. That's, that would be fine because I upfront, want to know what the changes are because you're telling me here that there are some changes, but I want you to view them in the secured website or are secured, are secured, you know, you know, a secure website. And, but if it's not information that's, that is seccurable. Like if you change generic wording or something like that, then I would want this in this email. You will have to, you said we recently processed a change, but it says if you did not initiate this request, the contract. That doesn't that it, that's not what this email is for this email said we did it, the va did it. And that sentence says they, if you didn't request a change, does that make sense?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Does it, is it is confusing and you're, yeah, you're picking up on exactly what? Yeah. Yep.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. But otherwise than that, it's just telling me a link, you know that there was a change, go see this link for the change. And I would just hope that it would have what the changes were. If it's a secure document. I get it. I just want to see if the change is up front and if it could be put on there as simple, then if it's generic enough across the board, then you could put it in the email. But if it's specifically to my, to my policy, then click on the link.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, great, great. Ian any further questions from you?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. No, that was great. And thank you for an extra five minutes. We appreciate it. And can I just say that your background makes me want to schedule a vacation to the Amazon? It's like I feel like I'm breathing deeper just looking at
1. **Participant 09:**
1. my daughter did this and I don't know how to take it off.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. That's perfect. That's so funny. Well, at least it's something nice. Well, Michelle, is there anything that you want to share with us that we didn't already cover today? No. Ok. Well, hey, we really appreciate you taking time to share your thoughts with us and just know that your feedback is so important and it's gonna help us to continue to improve these email communications. And yeah, just thank you so much and, and hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
1. **Participant 09:**
1. All right, you as well. Thank you so much. Take care. Bye bye.
1. 
1. **Participant 10:** INTERVIEW
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. Well, to get started, can you tell us what branch of the military you served in?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Navy, first, army, second.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Nice. And when did you retire or separate?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Separated from the Navy in 93 and separated from the army active, in 2002.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Ok.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. The reserves 2006.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. That's great. You dabbled in a little bit of everything.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Since separating, do you receive emails from the VA?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. I do, mostly about my medical appointments.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And we'll definitely going to be talking about that today for sure.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. When I was, going through the claim filing process, I also received emails here and there as well.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Wonderful. That's great. Any others that come to mind?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. No, mostly va va appointments. Ok. And like they inundate me with, they say you're not gonna forget this appointment, my phone, my computer letters. I'm like, stop it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Tell, tell us more about that. What kind of frequency or cadence would you prefer?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Well, they scheduled me like I have appointments sitting right here, for like next year and maybe a couple this year. The letters are fine. I can, you know, set them aside as reminders, but sometimes the, the text messages are kinda like, ok, I just confirmed this the other day. You're hitting me with this again. Why do I have to reconfirm? So, yeah, that kind of becomes a nuisance.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Gotcha. Yeah, that makes sense.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Every now and then from, what, you know, a particular clinic, I may get a phone call and those are very infrequent. So I don't mind those. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So it sounds like you are receiving a lot of different forms of communication, like as far as letters and emails and text messaging. Is there a way that you prefer the va to communicate to you?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Well, you know what I've become so immune or used to it if you were that I don't, I kinda don't mind but the, the one that I do mind is the bombardment of the text messages.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. The emails they come to but they're not as the, I think the text and the emails are about equal. Ok. So basically what I do is for the emails, I'll make a separate file folder for them and I'll put it in there for like video appointments or, you know, such as things like that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. That's so smart. I'm gonna steal your idea.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. I try to be organized. It doesn't always work out that way.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. No, that, that's a really great way to do that. I just have to hunt through mine. So that, yeah,
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. You mentioned, you mentioned that they, they, they bombard you is what would, what would the ideal frequency for the text or, or be?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Ok. So let's say if I had, well, when I'm, let's go back to when I make the appointment, they may send it, they may send it that day or a day after. That's fine. And then they'll send reminders like a week before and then a few days before and then like a day or two before. I'm like, ok, maybe once when you make the appointment, that's fine and then a couple of days before will be fine for me.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Ok. Ok, great.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, they don't want to let you forget, huh?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Like 9/11, we will never forget.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Oh God.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Oh my gosh. Well, we're gonna move into this next part of our discussion today. And so this is gonna be more of like, I'm gonna give you a scenario or ask a question about like maybe a time that you've received a, a type of email and get your idea of like what you would expect to see in that email type. And then we're gonna share an example of a current email that's being sent out from the va and have you look that over and see how that meets your expectations. And if everything makes sense,
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Ok, are you referring to like va medical appointments or just overall VA
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. They, I I feel like they kind of are more like benefit related. Yeah, but they, yeah, so for the first one, we're gonna talk about debt emails. So can you tell us a time that you received a debt related email from the va?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. No, I can't.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. I haven’t,
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Well, let's say that you've incurred some sort of debt with the va and you receive an email.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. What type of information would you expect to see in that email?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Just basically the type of debt that I incurred, maybe when it when it was occurred how much I owe if I paid on it any outstanding balances when it's due by if I am having trouble financially, there may be some what's the word I'm looking for? Somebody that I can reach out to that maybe help me, you know what I you know what I'm trying to say to help me on a budget type basis to make payment, so to speak.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. Ok. Well, let's say that you received this email and now my coworker Ian here is gonna share his screen just can, can you see that okay?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Yes.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, great. Well, take a look at this and let us know what you think this email is trying to convey to you and if there's anything that you would do from here information ok.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. They basically want me to click on the link and once that new page opens up, all the information, all the detailed information pertaining to this letter will be, you know, there for me to look over and if I have any questions and concerns, hopefully there will be an email or a phone number for somebody that I can contact.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And what do you think that this email is about?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Let's see, va Health administration.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. So, you know what? It doesn't sound like or it doesn't look like it may be and a medical appointment or anything. I don't know, maybe it's something relating to, you know what? This is a tough one because it's from coming from the health administration. So I wanna say something maybe related to my account or my health benefits or something like that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, and it's ok if you don't, if nothing, if you're like, I, I actually have no idea.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. That's a fine answer as well. So
1. **Participant 10:**
1. It’s an educated guess
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. I, yeah, I that's also fine. Ok. Well, let's say
1. **Participant 10:**
1. …let me back up, let me back up.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. I failed to read that second sentence. You will also receive a statement from the VHA with details. So a statement means I owe some money and so we form a fashion. So yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Well, let's say that you've received this email and then shortly after that you receive this other email and for the sake of this example, we've stacked them. So you can compare them. So the one on top is the one you've received first and then shortly after that you receive this one on the bottom. Tell us what you think this email is about and and what you would do from here.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Well, I've never received one of these emails ever. So you have information available from the Debt Management Center. They're trying to collect the debt of some sort. Sign into the link. Click the link to sign in to see, to view the details like it says, and it looks like they're making a further, further attempt to collect the debt.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. So the one on the bottom just to make sure I'm I'm hearing correctly is you're, you're viewing it as a follow up to the first one?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Correct.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ian, do you wanna jump in here?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. So, we're gonna pull back the the curtain here a little bit and and tell you let you know that the first one is actually what you would receive if you owed a copay for one of your medical visits. And the second one is related to an overpayment of benefits, let's say you had a, a beneficiary who aged out and, and you know, the va for whatever reason, either the, the records failed to update or, or you know, but they, they paid you too much and, and they, they're looking to collect that money back. So, knowing that, what sort of information, additional information, if any, would you want to see in these emails?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. More specifically what the, if, like you said, the co-payment, what the co-payment was for specifically, what exactly, or how much exactly they're trying to recoup, if they overpaid me, timelines, you know, dates and timelines and stuff like that. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Ok. Ok, great, thanks.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, you're doing great. By the way, I think you've done this before.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah,
1. **Participant 10:**
1. I have it
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. first timer
1. **Participant 10:**
1. I am accustomed to Zoom calls.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. So that's answering questions like this. This is a first.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Well, it's, you're doing wonderful, so
1. **Participant 10:**
1. thank you.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Thank you. All right, we'll move on to the next email type. Can you tell us a time you had an experience appealing a decision from the va regarding your benefits, for example.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Oh, the VA is a beast. Yes. I've had a lot of appeals. Ok, a lot of appeals, some of them got denied. Some of them went through, you know, because I spent 18 years post military career fighting the va for different health disabilities and putting in different claims. And then towards the end is where I bore the, the, you know, bear the grunt or the brunt of all things trying to fight with the VA because they say the higher, the higher your va disability rating is say, for example, if you're at 70 or 80% the more it's going to take for you to get to 100 if that makes any sense. But yeah, a lot of appeals, a lot of sending appeals into higher decisions. I forget what they call it. But yeah, a lot. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Can you tell us about any email communications you may have received regarding the appeal that?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Oh, it's been so long. I know I received a lot of letters. Ok. But more, I think more letters than emails.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Well, let's say that, that you do receive an email.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Let's say that a decision was made on an appeal. And you get an email about it, what kind of information would you be hoping to see in the email?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Information pertaining to the type of claim that I filed, kind of history or timeline backdated history that has gone through, what's to expect next? If there's any further information needed from me or anything like that?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. And, and, also, deadline dates that information needs to be, turned in and stuff like that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Well, let's say that, you know, that same scenarios happened, you've appealed the decision, or you've appealed the decision and they sent you this communication about it. What type of questions would you have about this email? Is, is the, this what you'd expect to see. And is there anything you would do from here?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Well, let's see. Ok. Well, if they're sending a letter out and then they're including a link in this letter to check my appeal status, it's obviously, I believe going to say the same thing that they're going to send a letter about. And if you have any questions before you get the letter, I'm guessing you can call the VA's toll free 1 800 hotline and ask them any further questions. I mean, until you get the letter or your VSO or your representative gets the letter, then you're just basically in a waiting status. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So if you receive this, what would you do?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. I will click on the link to see what kind of information is in there, whether it be an approval or denial and if it's approval, I'll be very happy. And if it's a denial, I'll get in touch with my service organization or VSO to see if they've received the letter and where we can go from there.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And what are your thoughts on the bottom half of this email said helpful.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Are you talking about where it starts with if you wish, starting there? Yeah. Ok. Well, I will let my VSO if they're really good, guide me and whatever steps I need to take if I wish to contact the veterans board, veterans Appeal board and what actions I need to do if it's a denial. What steps I would need to take if I wanna keep fighting it. Ok. And either they're going to initiate and do most of the work for me or they're going to give me the information, arm me with the information that I need to take steps myself. Ok? And I'm just basically speaking from experience.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, that's the wonderful, it's really helpful. We've spoken to a few people and not everyone has that level of experience to sort of speak to it like that. So really helpful.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. I, is there anything you wanted to ask P10 about? No, thats it Michelle before we move on to the next one. Is there anything else you want to share about this? This email here?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. No, I don't wanna relive the past. I made it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Fair fair.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right, we're gonna move on and look at another email type and let's say for this one that you submitted a document electronically to the va and something went wrong. For example, a system error on the back end and it caused the document you submitted to not be filed and you receive an email about that. What details would you want that email to include?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Ok. If I received the email, would it be saying that they have not received my documents? And if they, if they haven't received them that I need, would it be saying that I need to have these documents in by a certain time or are they notifying me that there was an error on their end and their system of receiving the documents so that the documents didn't come through? I'm just trying to play out all right for this situation.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. It's, it's a notification for you that, that there was an error.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. OK, I would just, if they gave me another link or a better link to where I could send it to, that's more bona fide and sure to go through, then I would follow the steps and use that link to upload or if they sent me a fax number, I would use a fax. But as far as sending, if they requested sensitive information, I would more so use the fax.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Got it. Well, let's say that this is the email that you receive. Also want to note that this is a long email. So when you get to the bottom, just give Ian a heads up and he can scroll down to the bottom for you, but kind of just, you know, talk us through what you're seeing and if it's what you expected or if you were wishing there was more.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Ok, give me one moment. Ok. So do you want me to address like everything when I go through like the first paragraph, address that and then continue on OK. The first paragraph is OK. Maybe I sent some information in and there's, they see that I attempted maybe in their system to get it to send it through to them, but resulted in some type of error, excuse me, or failure to hold on or failure to successfully, get through the system. And maybe they're notifying me that they see that I'm trying to file a claim and that maybe my claim is one of many that they're reviewing, like it says, potentially impacted va server error or something like that. I'm just guessing. I don't know. Yeah. Ok. Sounds like the claim did go through and they did get the information that they're looking for in the second paragraph and that they're doing a thorough review to determine the impact of my compensation benefits if any, I don't need to do anything. OK. But just wait a question.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Do you, do you feel like this paragraph is telling you a different story or were you just kind of walking through the scenario?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. I just wanna, I'm sorry, go ahead. I'm, I'm kind of walking through it and to me the first paragraph kind kind of conflicts with the second paragraph. I don't know a little bit. It's saying it seems like they're saying that there was an issue with my claim being submitted for whatever reason, but then they're also saying that in the second paragraph, like they received everything all the information I wish to be reviewed. And I, I don't know, it's kind of conflicted to me a little bit. Ok. It says may have resulted in a failure to establish a claim. I don't know, what is the issue that they identified that resulted in a failure for somebody to establish a claim. That's what I'm trying to figure out based on my past submissions. I don't, yeah, I'm not getting that part. Ok. Yeah, I'm not, I'm not kind of getting that right there, that first paragraph and it's kind of throwing my brain back and forth. But reading on it seems like they did get, get my information and at this time, no action is needed. If they have anything further that they need from me, they'll respond to correspondence, keep their information updated so I can contact them, links to find further information if I need further information on anything. Ok. And I'm at the bottom of this page. All right.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Scroll there for you.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Ok. Yeah. So, they're just basically giving you all the information links, telephone numbers. I guess if you're deaf, you call that relay, and all the addresses and phone numbers you need and fax numbers you need to correspond if you need to correspond with them for anything. And of course, your Veterans crisis line, if you're in a crisis, mental health crisis.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. And do you feel that having all of this here is helpful Is, or is there like one or two key components that you would want to use? I mean, the information every they're supplying you with all the information you would need if you're doing this on your own to reach out to somebody and ask questions and you know, to see what you need to do, what's missing or what have you.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. The links are there. If you don't wanna call, you can click on the links for further information. That's as best as I can do right now for this. Yeah, that's like you again doing great.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ian, is there anything that you want to dig into on this one or are you good?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah. Yeah,
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Michelle, is there anything further? You said? I think you're at a point where your feedback is. Are you anything you wanna add?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. No. Yeah, just, you know everything that I'm reading and you're asking me and stuff right now is just taking me back down memory lane.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Ok, I'll, I'll say thank you.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. And I'm sorry.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Are you a veteran?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. I, no, no, I'm, I'm, I'm a, I'm a navy brat.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Both my parents were in the navy.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. What about you?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. My dad was in the navy but I've, I've not served personally.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Ok. My dad was army, so I'm an army brat military myself. My daughter is in the air force now, my other family member, my brother was army. So, yeah, we're a service oriented family.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Oh, that's awesome.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Thank you.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Thank you. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Well, our next one, hopefully, will drag us away from that. And we're gonna be talking about appointment reminders. So, and that's something you already mentioned. So, I know that you have some familiarity with it. So what has your experience been like as far as the level of information? I know that we, we talked about the cadence of it not being like or the frequency of it, not being exactly what you wanted, but specifically email. Like the content that's in there. Has it been clear enough? Is there enough information for you? Is there any questions that you might have had when you got these emails?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Well, some well, I will mention that some of the emails that come through are saying that you have an excuse me, an appointment reminder and you click on it and it'll be a drop down list of all your future appointments coming up. And then you know, of course you can do what you want because you know it's coming again. Sometimes I delete them because I can always go into my healthy vet and open up my appointments link and see the appointments from there just to clear out and keep my email box clean. So I mean, I know what to expect. Now I know what to do. I know how to maneuver around the internet and emails and stuff. So, yeah, and then they'll send an appointment reminder. And I'll just delete it unless it's a video appointment, then I'll put it in my video appointment file because those those emails are less frequent than the regular appointments are.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Interesting. Well, let's say that you receive this email about your appointment. Also it may look a little different than the current version that you're getting. But just for the sake of today, let's say this is what you receive, sort of talk us through what you're seeing. And if everything makes sense, if like is this what you were hoping to see, what kind of information would you want here?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Oh, and this is another long one. So when you get to the bottom, let me know and I'll scroll for you.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Ok? Ok. So, they're just basically letting me know that my appointment that's coming up was last, last updated in the system, which it also says that in my health event, when you click on my appointments, they're saying before your appointment call, so you don't really have to call the va facility because they're gonna bombard you with those texts and you either hit y whatever the two digit number is to confirm. No, you can't keep this appointment. Then that's when I think you should call in and try to reschedule or cancel or whatever. If and it has also excuse me, ad and a double digit number if you need details, if you can't remember exactly what that appointment is for. The only thing I don't like about the detail one is that it'll give you information of the clinic that is for, but it won't give you a time or anything like that. That's the only thing I wish they would put into their text reminders is the time of the appointment. It'll give you the date, but it won't give you time. So therefore, in saying that you have to circle back around to my healthy vet click on my appointments, go down to that specific appointment and then you could click on that and get all the details including the time. So,
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. So you're, you're saying that even even even with all the details in here, you still have to chase down and, and figure out information in order to get to your appointment?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. You know what II I take that back because at the top it does say at the time but some emails or some of the text, my mind reverted to the text won't have the the time. So that's why I said that. But this letter, yeah, it clearly states the date and time. But it doesn't, what I don't see in here is who the appointment is for. And if you're somebody like me, you have several different health issues going on. You kinda, if, if you have appointments, like a lot of appointments in the month of whatever, it's hard to keep track of, you know, what appointments are, who, you know, what clinics the appointments are for. So you gotta kinda do back and forth of cross referencing and checking and, you know, stuff like that.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. We don't, we don't want to make you do that. We don't want to make you do that if you have like Medicare Medicaid.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Yeah, bring that but I just basically rely solely on the va health system. They've been good for me so far. So
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ian, do you want to scroll down a little or, or P10 are you ready for him to scroll down?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Ok. Yeah. Mhm. Excuse me. So yeah, the the second gray box, I'm looking at the date and the time and everything that looks like something I would click on in my health event under the appointment section cause I'm looking at the word confirm kind of remind me. That's what I see when I check my appointments on my healthy bet. Gives you all the information and the clinic contact information. Sometimes it may follow with a an extension because that number there not per se that number, the number to the clinic is just the basic overall va hospital that you will call and get the operator. If it has an extension, then you can go straight to that clinic. Yeah, like it says go to my healthy vet. If you're familiar with that platform to maneuver around in there, you can do that too. Get your appointment summary information. Ok. Yeah, so yeah, in a nutshell. Yep.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. I don't have any further questions on this one. Do you, Ian?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. No, no, no, no. Yeah, we covered it and oh, just to clarify, I, when I, when I was asking you what if you know, if you had to go to my healthy vet because you didn't get the time. I wasn't saying that this didn't provide it. I was just, it was interesting to me that, that, that they wouldn't provide it and texting, it just seems pulling again, pulling back the curtain. It seems silly to give you this much detail here but have one piece of information missing so that you have to do a whole another thing. Like why not just say, hey, you've got appointments, go check my healthy vet my mind.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. My mind keeps going back to the text because I get more texts than anything and that limited information that comes in the text. You know, that's kind of burned in your brain when you, it's like repetitiveness, you know, you get those texts. It's like, OK, you have an appointment such such a, you know, it just tells you the clinic but you know, you not even have the time the text message.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Exactly.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Ok. That's always been a concern for me. I wish they would, you know, change that and put that in there.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. It's like the cable guys, you know, like we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll show, we'll show up between eight and four PM
1. **Participant 10:**
1. all day
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. and it's actually 3:59.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Wait your show up like mine always show up an hour after the bracket. Oh, yeah. No, I'm good. No more. No more questions on this one.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Ok. Right. But wait, there's more.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Yes, I think we have, I think we have two, maybe three more.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So they're smaller than this.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. We put, we put the big ones in the middle.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. This one's about your VA profile. Have you ever received an email that something on your VA profile needs to be updated?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. No. Are you, wait, are you talking about my, my healthy vet va profile or my VA profile?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. You know, honestly, I'm not sure.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ian, do you know?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. This one pertains to the VA.gov profile which unfortunately is different and I'm impressed that, you know, that they're, that they're two separate things.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. So, yeah, this, this particular one
1. **Participant 10:**
1. After 18 years of fight with the va I, I'm not gonna say I'm well versed but I'm well versed.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. You sound well versed.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. I think you get to say that now. Well, ok, let's say that something does need to be updated on your I guess va.gov VA profile. And you get an email about it. What would you expect that email to say to let you know that?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Maybe about my personal information, address, phone number, we attempted to contact you but the phone number is not valid anymore.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Maybe just double check your information to make sure all your, personal information that we have is updated. Or maybe they're just running a system wide thing to make sure people have their information updated in the system. That's one thing that I could think of. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Well, let's say that that you do receive this email and the va needs to update or confirm your mailing address. What type of questions would you have if any?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. How did I know this?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Right? You were spot on.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. I was like, is she reading this already?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. I didn't, I didn't forward the screen.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. I didn't the screen, right. Yeah. I told you 18 years of fighting. Recently sent you a mail that was unable to deliver. Ok. Yeah. Then that's when they were, they attempted to contact you by snail mail, no response returned. And then they sent you a va email for the VA or I, I don't know if it would be an email or it would, you would just have to go into your va.gov portal or your page and see if they sent you a message there? Ok. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Right. And let's say you, you signed in and you checked, you, you checked your address and you haven't moved and so you're, you know, the, the address is, is the same and it's accurate and it's correct. Then what would you do if anything wtf Right. Yeah, that's fair. Are they talking about?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Right. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Right. Right. Ok. So, yeah, you just, you would confirm, digitally, confirm the email address.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. I would go in there and check to make sure my information is correct and maybe just backspace on something and retype it over and then hit save and go from there. I mean, that's, that's what I could think of. All right.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. This next one is a little niche. So if you have not had experience with it, we might just skip it but curious. Have you ever filed a notice of disagreement with the va?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. As far as claims or what are we speaking of?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, I believe so.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. That sounds like an appeal. If you disagree with something, you appeal it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ian thoughts. Yeah, I got this one or Yeah, I hm.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Am I stumpping you guys?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. You are, you are.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Absolutely. I'm like, I'm like she's talking sense. Why would they call it a notice of disagreement? Why is that any different? So yeah. We could just take, take a quick peek and take a peek at it and just see if it like so essentially it's the same thing.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Your notice of disagreement has been filed. Your appeal details are below below. Yeah. Notice of disagreement. It's like repeating the same thing, but in different words.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Right.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Right. Right. It's, it's essentially a receipt.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Exactly.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Because we got, we got, we got what you, we got the, your notice and we got it on this date.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Right. I've learned, I've learned over the 18 years that I did fight with the va having to file claims. I've learned as I went along that I need to comb through any messages I receive, whether it be letter or by messages through the VA or emails or whatever, comb through it with a fine to comb. Yep.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yep. Yep. Yeah. Yeah, we've, we've, we've heard that dates, dates matter. Yes.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Right. Definitely.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Cool. Yeah, let's move on to our last one.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, this is our last one. and it's regarding VA life insurance. So, have you ever received an email communication, from the va regarding your va life insurance I have and, and letters. Ok. And what was your experience with the, the email?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Well, I saved a couple of them because I need to go in and try to get something together, excuse me, try to get something together to, establish some type of, something to leave my daughter. But I don't know, it's just something about life. Just life experience. I'm scared. I'm not gonna say I'm scared to death because that's inevitable. But I don't know. I just keep for some reason putting it up because I, it's like part of me doesn't wanna face it. Yeah. If that makes any sense, it makes a lot of sense. But it's always, it's always in the back of my mind. But you never know because tomorrow's promise to nobody. Right. That's right. That's, yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. Truer words were never spoken, that's for sure. Well, let's say a change was made to your va life insurance and they sent you an email. What would you want the email to say to convey that to you?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Maybe? Mm let's see if there is a change in if correct me, if I'm wrong, maybe deductible that I would have to pay or if it's gonna change at a certain age or what I may be eligible for after having had life insurance for so long. Something along those lines, I'm guessing.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. I imagine it probably could be any of those.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So what would you want the email to say? Like to alert you of?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. If they're gonna send me a check for a million dollars?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. I've been waiting for that email my whole life.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. So that would be the best email ever, right? But I don't want a follow up email that says wait for it, wait for it. All right. Let's have it. Let's have it. All right. Here we go. Ok. Yeah, if I mean, if I maybe forgot that I initiated a request. Yeah, I'll, I'll call in or I'll click, I'll click to see what it is first to maybe jog my memory say. Oh, yeah, I did make that change and if I don't remember or can't recall, yeah, I'll call the number. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Is there anything else you'd want this email to, to tell you or is this feel pretty succinct like like enough information?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Yeah. Well, yeah, they're just gonna put the basic information in there, you know, click the link, check if you have any further questions, call us and they'll line your questions up and have them ready if you're calling.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Ian, do you have any further questions?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah. No, this is great.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. And P10, is there anything else that you want to share with us that we didn't already cover today?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. No, I cut and dry. I hope I answered all you guys questions.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Absolutely. For sure.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Was it as painful as you thought it was gonna be?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. No, no, actually, no, I thought I was going to have to like maybe not so much share a screen or just follow directions on going into my VA.gov account while we're doing the Zoom call. That's what I thought of doing. Yeah. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. No, no, we wouldn't, we wouldn't ask you to do that and we also. Yeah, we, we, we don't do the, like, do you slightly disagree? Mostly disagree.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Agree, partially disagree.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Oh, yeah. No. No, we wouldn't torture you like that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Which smiley face the best associates with how this makes you feel?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. And I know that's why I noticed the emails that get sent out for these surveys. You have to jump on them pretty quick, especially if you're paid surveys. So, yeah, because they, the slots seem to fill up pretty quickly.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Interesting.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Interesting. You know, I do have one last question and it's kind of silly. But, and, and it's silly on purpose. if you had, if we gave you a magic wand and all you had to do was wave it and you could change one thing about the way the va communicates with you. What would that change be?
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Now, in what aspects are we talking? It's, it's up to you, it's up to you.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. It's a magic wand. You can do anything you want.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Not take the claim process so long to, I mean, what are these raters doing? Something to expedite the process?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah. Ok. Yeah. Absolutely.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Absolutely. But then again, on the flip side, the longer they take, the long, the more you make. That's fair when it comes to retro. Yeah, it's a trade off. Right. Exactly. You're pro, you got to weigh the pros and cons.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. I know that we are over time, P10, but just really want to thank you so much for taking time to, you know, stick with us this afternoon and, and answer questions and provide your feedback. Thank you.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. And the words of Chick Fil a, my pleasure.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Oh my gosh.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Can we have you for every session, please? The most fun.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Honestly, I, I like to laugh because laughter is the best medicine for everything, I believe.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. You're in the right group then. we love you.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Yes, we love that with having not to get personal or anything with having just lost my mom last month I did so I can get Yeah, so I'm not gonna talk too much about that because I feel that lump.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ian and I are in the same awful club with you.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So yes, so we we, we understand that and but yes, know that we are. We're here with you in solidarity. That's Yeah.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. I appreciate that.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Thank you so much for your time. Hang in there.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. I will thank you to get another one of these soon. Yeah, for sure. You all do you all moderate each? All these or not? No, not.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. It's we do the va does tons of research like this. So yeah, yeah. There's
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Hopefully I get somebody as fun as you guys next time.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Thank you. We hope you do too, for sure.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Absolutely. This left a good lasting impression on me. So thank you all.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. You made my day.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. Now we're gonna get me some chick fil a
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. That's a perfect thing to get.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. All right, have a wonderful day.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Thank you too.
1. **Participant 10:**
1. You too. Bye bye.
1. 
1. 
1. 
1. PARTICIPANT 11 INTERVIEW
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Just to get started. Can you tell me what, branch, branch or branches of the military you served in?
1. **Participant 11**
1. I was in the Navy.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Navy. Awesome. I'm a navy brat myself. Never did serve but, but both my parents were, were in the navy. When did you, when did you retire or separate?
1. **Participant 11**
1. I left there in 1971.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. All right. Fantastic. All right. Since, retiring or have you, have you, or do you currently receive emails from the va?
1. **Participant 11**
1. Yeah, I receive updates for the, I'm a part of the, well, thats what I call the blue button premium care. So I, I get updates, get their newsletter as well as I can communicate with my providers that way. Ok. Oh, cool, great, great.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Any other, any other emails come your way that, that, that come to mind?
1. **Participant 11**
1. No. Ok. That through the VA.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Ok. Let's see. Typically, from the va if you do, you, do you not have a lot of communication… you mentioned 1971. so is, is your, is your communication with the va infrequent or you just, are you, you're communicating through different means with the va like letters and phone calls and stuff like that?
1. **Participant 11**
1. Mainly since I got out in ‘71 because I was young. I, I really had, I really had zero communication till I got to retirement age. And then I had, medical care through the local va clinic. And, and that's, that's when I really primarily had, the emails come from the newsletters. And, and then, like I said, I communicate with my primaries through the internet as well.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, great, great, great.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All righty. Well, today we're going to, we're gonna do, it's sort of a two part thing where we're gonna ask you to imagine a scenario and ask you questions about what you would expect in that scenario and then show you, an actual artifact or an actual email and then, and then get your impressions about that. We're gonna do that, do that a couple or couple or five times. I promise we won't, I promise we won't, we won't keep you too long. But, have you ever received an email from the va that was, debt related?
1. **Participant 11**
1. No.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Let's say, just hypothetically here that you were to receive, an email, from the va about a debt. What would you expect to see in that email?
1. **Participant 11**
1. I guess I, I, I'd be surprised they would send it to me to start with. Unless, unless there's some connection, unless some connection to it. You know, maybe the name of the person and maybe their branch if it, so I can understand who and why it's sent to me. But, you know, maybe their age but outside of that, I mean, that's all personal business. You know, why they died or how they died. So right.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Oh sorry, not, not when, when I say a debt I'm talking about like for example an example of of a debt I'm sorry. De bt. No.
1. **Participant 11**
1. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. Ok. Apologies.
1. **Participant 11**
1. All right. So they're sending to me that I owe them money is what you're saying.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. That's right.
1. **Participant 11**
1. Ok. Well then if, if they send it to me, I'd like to know specifically what it is I owe for.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok.
1. **Participant 11**
1. Yeah and maybe later we could talk about something that I I think should change. But anyway yeah, I'd like to know what it was for and when that incurred. Things that would that would be definitely be helpful to know that some some context I get it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yes that check that checks out. Cool, cool cool. All right. Ok, so let's say you were to receive and Elissa, my colleague here is gonna share share her screen and show you an example of a debt email. Ok. Let's say you were to receive this email. What are your general impressions? Does, does this leave you with any questions?
1. **Participant 11**
1. Yeah. It leaves me with a lot of questions. It, unfortunately, I know they're doing it to be secure but it makes me, it makes me more or less jump through hoops to find out what this is. Had it… had it just said because I have past medications or a doctor's visit on this date, then I could, when I call I could directly address it here, I have to go through and find out where it's at. Yeah, so I, I would, I would like it to come to me with more detail than just that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Mhm. Can you, can you drill down into that? What, what types of detail would you like? Ok.
1. **Participant 11**
1. It was an Ortho visit on this date and I owe that much money because of the visit or the device I got or the shot I got that would be very helpful as opposed to me having to go to the site and then I'm, I'm sure now it comes up, I'll have to go through more steps to find out what's going on. Mhm.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Mhm. Yeah, that, that checks out. That's, that's exactly what I was curious about. Thank you. Let's say shortly after this email, you receive another email. And they're gonna be stacked vertically here. The the this original one will be on top Ok. And the the second one will, will be on the bottom. Oh, it's just, just so just so you're able to, to I can see I can move it up.
1. **Participant 11**
1. Ok. It's, you know, I think it's the same problem. It's just reminding me that I have a debt but it gives me no, no context of what's going on.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Yeah,
1. **Participant 11**
1. Because what would be nice is if I knew that I could check my records and say, oh, I did pay it. It was with whatever a credit card or a check or, you know, so I can follow up and say, oh, it was, it was paid for, oh, no, I forgot. And I didn't pay it and thought I did.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Yeah. Ok. Cool.
1. **Participant 11**
1. And you're, you're bringing up something that's good because this happens when I get my medications. I would wish when I go to pay it that it would show me what, what I got. And when all I get is, is after the fact, like, like recently I just got medications that came and then, you know, it's like three weeks, four weeks later because I could, I would like to pay it when I get it as opposed to waiting and then, and then sometimes, I may pay it and then a doctor decides they're gonna send me different, me, some more medication and now, now I, I don't know is it, is this part of the first part or the second part? So, yeah, that's, that's, and even when you go on the site it doesn't help you, it doesn't have, it broke down that way. So, that would be, yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, great. So, so it's a way of helping, you know, how would you, what would you want to see in those communications that would let you know, which with, like, w would it be broken down by medication by visit? But I'm just, I'm throwing things out here and I probably shouldn't, I, I’m leading and I apologize. Usually we try not to do that, but it's ok.
1. **Participant 11**
1. What, what would be nice is when my medication comes, it'd be nice if there's a bill in there that says you owe X amount of dollars for this medication, then I could go online and pay it right away when I do it when I go. Now. I don't, I don't know. It just comes up that I owe the money and I, and I have to, I don't know because it, because there's too much of a lag between getting the medicine and getting the bill. I, I can't imagine remembering what a thing was for a month later.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. Yeah, that makes, makes a lot of sense.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, so we're gonna, we're gonna pull back the curtain here a little bit and, and let you know that the first email is actually related to. It's, it's not a, the second one is not a follow up to the first. The first is a, an email regarding a copay for a visit. That, that the veteran would receive. The second one is an email that a veteran would receive if there was an overpayment. For example, like if a beneficiary aged out and the va for whatever reason, there was a lag in updating their records and they, they gave you too much money and now they, they, they've referred it to the Debt Management Center. OK. So knowing and with that additional context, can you tell me, you know, do you know if are there any, you know what, what would you like to see, in…
1. **Participant 11**
1. I think again, it's, it's nice if it's, if it's kind of spelled out because when you look, I mean, when you look at these, they both look the same.
1. **Participant 11**
1. I obviously, now you look closer once as debt management, the other is Veterans administration. But again, like I say, if it's a month or two later, you have no idea or context. Even when you do call and ask questions, you have to ask them what it's for as opposed to having some knowledge and say, oh, this is for whatever and I understand and I can pay it rather than them saying, well, now you got to the wrong person and they transfer you around. A good example of this is they were, they sent me a letter and said they didn't get, couldn't get a hold of me for an appointment and I didn't have any appointments. So I didn't know what, what they're talking about. And so when I called the number they gave me, they said, oh yeah, this is for your annual physical in 2024 in April that you got a new doctor and they wanna reschedule you because I guess whatever they gave me wasn't good. So I said, ok, schedule me and they said, oh, that I can't schedule you. That department has to call you directly. I said, ok. So what happens is every time they call, if I don't get the call, they leave me a number to call. I call that number and the number always say, oh, you have to talk to them directly. We can't do it. And I finally, so I finally told him, look, send a message back to us to call me directly. Book me. It's a whole year in advance. I said I have my schedule should be wide open. Give me any day, any time. I don't care, just book it. So that kind of kind of like what you're talking here. It's, there's no context to it and I have no idea.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh man. Yeah. What, like, what's the alternative? You just sit by the phone all day. Yeah.
1. **Participant 11**
1. And then unfortunately I picked, I have my phone set up with all the scam calls and all this other stuff that if you're not in my contacts, I, I won't usually answer it. And then what's really silly is they leave a message for me to call and, and that's the outfit that can't help me. So, it's kind of silly.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. I'm so sorry.
1. **Participant 11**
1. That's ok. No, that's, that's the, please, please. I don't want to get the wrong idea. The va is wonderful for me, so far as medical care and medicines, it's just those little things that are a little aggravating and…
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Those are the, exactly the kind of things that we can change.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So, you know, that's, that's what we're, that's what we're after here today. We wanna, you know, we wanna, we wanna sand the corners on this, you know. So, yeah. No, this is all great, great feedback. All right, let's see here. Elissa. Do you have any anything you want to follow, follow up on, on that one? Ok. So next, have you ever appealed a decision with the VA?
1. **Participant 11**
1. No, I haven't. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Let's say, let's say the, the, the va made a decision about your benefits and you appealed that decision. What would you expect? And, and then the VA notified you that, that they had, you know, that they had, come to a decision on that appeal, what would you expect that communication to contain?
1. **Participant 11**
1. It, it'd be nice as whatever they decide that it would have a detailed answer of yes or no and why they didn't approve it. And it'd be nice if they say, yeah, it, it falls under whatever their guidance is or even, and, or even, I guess if I wanna appeal that it'd be nice if I had instructions on how to appeal that I needed more information or I needed some kind of documentation, I guess what I'm saying is kind of have a road map if you get, if you get turned down. Yeah. Yeah, that would be nice. Ok, great, great, great.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Well, let's say you received the following communication. What what, what questions do you have? What, what here we go, your impressions I did.
1. **Participant 11**
1. Mhm hm. Ok. Again, it doesn't, it just says that they, let's see, I wanna see what they're saying here. … Oh, I guess it would be nice… Hopefully the phone number that they're giving you will get you where you need to go. We here it says don't reply to this email, you know, or the message. So, so you're either stuck calling that number. If, if that's, if that's the direct, it would be nice if it's a direct number or when you do go to the website that they can get you, the person that could give you the answers.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Yeah, cool.
1. **Participant 11**
1. Just nice they gave you the docket number because you should have that so you can look at what you're appealing.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah.
1. **Participant 11**
1. And I don't think, does it ever say what it appeal?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. It does not include the decision.
1. **Participant 11**
1. Yeah. No. Ok. I wanted to see if I missed it. So. Yeah. Yeah, I, yeah, it'd be nice if you know, if, if the decision was, hey, you, you were granted it, then all of this is for naught. I mean, you don't have to do anything, right? So yeah, it'd be nice to say. Yeah. And then like you said, if it's not, this is who you call or this is how the next step to go to, right? OK.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, great. Thanks a any, any questions?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. I do have a question. Nicholas when you first started reading this? Yeah, you kind of kind of chuckled about something. What was it?
1. **Participant 11**
1. It, it again, I guess it's just a typical thing you're gonna get from the va that doesn't tell you much unfortunately. So that was my, unfortunately my chuckle to see it is like it's just a typical va document that says, OK, we, we got some information and that's it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, great. OK, cool.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. So our next scenario is that you are uploading a file in service of, of a claim that, that you're making. Well, well, I'll say, well, did, did I already ask you if you've ever dealt with claims at the va?
1. **Participant 11**
1. I did, I did get a claim but I went through disabled veterans and they pretty much handled it. That was nice. So, I haven't done it on my own.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Oh, nice, nice, nice. It's, it's, yeah, to, to put it mildly, it's a process. Yeah.
1. **Participant 11**
1. Well, it kind of, it kind of kept me out of the process there. Just the ones that had to deal with all these letters like you're showing me got you.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So, so let's imagine that you are uploading evidence for a claim. And there is a back end system error. What would you expect? Then the va sends you a communication letting you know there was an error. What would you expect that communication to contain?
1. **Participant 11**
1. I guess what the error was and how they're going to correct it hopefully, and, and then hopefully, then they can move forward with because I'm sure that's gonna stall the whole process if, if there's a problem, you know, I, I would like to see what the resolution is of the problem that's theirs. Yeah. So that, that's basically it. I would think that that would be it the least you get. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Well, let's say, this was the communication you contained or, or that you received. What, what questions if any do you have failure to establish him as any pre yeah, again it.
1. **Participant 11**
1. Ok. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Also P11, I'm so sorry to interrupt you, but I wanted to wanted to let you know that this email is particularly long. So once you get to the bottom, if you're ready for me to scroll, I can do that.
1. **Participant 11**
1. Oh, there's more. Ok. Keep going then.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Thanks Elissa.
1. **Participant 11**
1. Ok. All right. Ok. So it has a little more information on where to go, but it would be nice to know. Can we go back to the top again? Ok. So it says, so it says that failed to base, on the claim of past admissions, it would be nice to know what, what I need to qualify for that since it didn't qualify to, to guide me how to get the proper paperwork if I have it or write doctors to see. And I don't know if those numbers there would help me if I called them and said, can you give me some direction on why did it fail? And what do I need to do to get it moving forward?
1. **Participant 11**
1. Yeah. Ok, cool. All right.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Great. Elissa. Any, any follow ups?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah, I was just curious what you thought about, the, ways of contacting for questions or assistance. And do you feel like, go ahead, go ahead.
1. **Participant 11**
1. Sorry. No, no, no, you go ahead. Yeah, we're good. Well, I think it's nice that you have that it gives you some place to go. I mean, it's nice that I have these options that I guess the problem has, like I thinking about my appointment, I hope it wasn't that I go to these people and they say, oh, yeah, I understand you got turned down but you need to talk to so and so, and they need to call you kind of thing as long as it's to the right people. Yeah, that'd be great. I, I think that's good that it has all that information to let you know who to talk to. Ok, great. Thank you. You're welcome.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Cool. Well, based on our earlier conversation, I know you've scheduled an appointment. Have you ever received a va appointment reminder?
1. **Participant 11**
1. Yes.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, great. And, what was, what was your impression of those?
1. **Participant 11**
1. Some, sometimes they come too late. But, I mean, if it's, if it's within a certain, you know, within a month or two, that's fine, but they're, they're sending me updates for something for next year. So, so what happened in this case? Like I said, they, because my appointment so far out they changed the, I've had maybe two or three changes of a doctor and what they do is they send me, something that says, oh, now you got a new doctor and here's your appointment again, the same appointment. It's I guess it's a moot point for me. It's like, you know, I, I'll see whatever doctor you send me to and it's kind of a waste of time for them. I think to remind me of my appointment in 2024 just because I got a new doctor. Yeah. So I, I would think that, our appointment reminders that would be, closer to when my appointment is due, you know, a month before two months before. And even I, I'm, I'm, I guess for an old guy, I'm kind of techie compared to everybody else but you know, an email or even a text would be great. Just know that I can see it and, oh, yeah, I'll double check what I got in my, what I have on my calendar or a lot of them have or do you wanna add this to your calendar as soon as it comes? Right?
1. **Participant 11**
1. Perfect.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's a excellent suggestion. I love that. ok, let's say you receive the following appointment reminder. Ok. Can you just tell us your general impressions and let us know if
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Also this is another really long one. So, yeah, just give me a heads up when you're ready.
1. **Participant 11**
1. Ok. So update on the 22nd. Mhm. Ok. Ok. All right. Why don't you move it up? Ok. Ok. Yeah. Yeah. I like this one because it gives me not only my current appointment but what's, what's coming to see if anything's changed? So, I, I think this is a, a better one. Great from the other ones I saw. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Is there any, what would you do? What would you do with, with this information or this email? Is there, is there any actions you would take or,…
1. **Participant 11**
1. For me, I would double check obviously my calendar for these ones that are later that would help me out to make sure that I have them. Again, I don't know if it would be, again, I don't know if everybody is techie, but it'd be nice that if you to have it that, like you say, you could just hit it and put it on your calendar. Yeah, that, that would be the only thing that would be different. I mean, yeah, II, I think it's pretty good. Ok. Did that great, let's say any, any follow ups?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Have you ever, received a communication from the va asking you to update your profile information, whether it's, email or mailing address or anything like that?
1. **Participant 11**
1. I don't, I don't remember getting any for that updating. No. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. If you were to receive such a communication, what would you expect it to contain?
1. **Participant 11**
1. Maybe, because I don't know if a lot of veterans know where to go to update their information that, that might be helpful, or would be nice if they said to update it. It would be nice to say if nothing's changed, don't you don't have to do anything. Right. I, I think that would be good because, you know, someone goes through all the effort to do it and it's, it's not changed so they didn't need to go there to start with.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yep. That's an excellent point. Excellent point. All right, let's say, let's say you receive the following, communication.
1. **Participant 11**
1. Ok. Yeah, that's, the va, ok. Is this a long one too?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Oh, it's just, there's just a few bits, bits at the bottom there. Yeah.
1. **Participant 11**
1. Ok. Yeah, I mean, that looks pretty straightforward and it looks like, they gave me where to go, you just click on that to do it. Yeah, because it, to me it'd be concerning to check because if nothing's changed and they can't get a hold of me, they may have something wrong in the system. So, yeah, that, that looks pretty straightforward. I like that one. Ok. Tells me that they, they couldn't get a hold of me via mail, right? So something's not right. Mhm. Yep.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So let's say you, you click on the link, you go in there to update your information and, it's all, everything's on the up and up, everything is correct. What action would you take at that point? If any?
1. **Participant 11**
1. Yeah, the problem would be that I'd be confused on who do I talk to, to let them know it was an input error. I, I would assume that at the va end and, and I don't, it just, it says you can contact these people but, you know, at this website but it's not, you know, you're not talking to a real person to let them know.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. That's just an, it's just an informational page. Not a, not a human being.
1. **Participant 11**
1. Yeah. I mean, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It would be nice to talk to a person and say, hey, was, what do you have down at your end? Because what I saw look looks right. Ok. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So, so perhaps a a phone number to call?
1. **Participant 11**
1. Yeah. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Mhm. Ok, great. Elissa any, any follow ups? Ok. Have you, this one's and this one's kind of a niche notice. So if, if you haven't received one, we'll, we'll just skip it. But have you ever filed a notice of disagreement with the va?
1. **Participant 11**
1. No.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. OK. All right. No worries. How about have you ever received a document regarding life insurance from the va?
1. **Participant 11**
1. Wow. Yeah, I think, I think I have, I, I hate to say it. I get information from everybody and their cousin for cremations and life insurance. So I think I may have. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. Let's say you made a change to your va life insurance and they send, send you a confirmation. What would you expect that confirmation to contain?
1. **Participant 11**
1. Obviously the confirmation would be what changes I made and it might be nice to see this is what it was before and this is what you're changing it to. I think that would be a nice reminder because, I mean, I'm sure some of the veterans get pretty old and don't remember what it was before and that might clue them in. Oh, this is why I changed it and here it is.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yep. Yeah. Ok, great. All right. Let's say you've received the, the following communication after you made a change.
1. **Participant 11**
1. Ok. You have a new life insurance. Again. Yeah, it, it's nice that if I didn't make any changes, but if I did it doesn't give me any information about what I changed, you know, until I go to this website and then hopefully I'll see it. But I guess the, the simpler you can make it, the, the better it is for the veteran, I think. Mhm. Yeah, because it doesn't tell me what, what changes have been done. And they want me to review it, but it'd be nice if they just had it there.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. Yep. Yep. And, and, and if it wasn't here, you, your expectation is that it would absolutely have all the things that you were expecting, or that you mentioned that you'd expect that what it changed from and to once you, once, once you drilled into the the and to the link. Ok.
1. **Participant 11**
1. Yeah, that would be, that would be nice.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah. Ok, great. Fantastic. Elissa, do you have any other questions? Oh man. Well, P11, thank you so much for your time today. We really appreciate your help and yeah, we use a Absolutely. We're gonna use all of the things you told us to make these notifications more useful. Thanks. Yep. Yep, yep. All right. Well, enjoy, enjoy the rest of your day and your weekend, sir.
1. **Participant 11**
1. Ok. Thanks for trying to make the va better.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Hey, yeah, absolutely. Our pleasure. Our pleasure. Thank you.
1. **Participant 11**
1. Take care. Bye bye bye.
1. 
1. **Participant 12** INTERVIEW
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. I wasn't sure if it went through or not. All right. Well, can you tell us, a little bit about yourself? So, like, what branch of the military you served in?
1. **Participant 12**
1. Can you say that again? I'm sorry, I was putting my headset on.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Oh, yeah, of course. We were just wondering if you could tell us what branch of the military you served in?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Army National Guard.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And when did you retire or separate?
1. **Participant 12**
1. I retire in, Oh, God, that was it September of 2018?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And, and since retiring, have you, received any emails from the VA?
1. **Participant 12**
1. Yeah, I do. I, I guess from the, my healthy vet, I do and they send other, like, veteran, like, newsletter, things like that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And based on your past, like history of receiving emails from the va what was your experience like?
1. **Participant 12**
1. I, I mean, I don't know, I guess they come in sometimes they don't come to my inbox so they'll go to like another box, like a not really spam, but just different, I guess category.
1. **Participant 12**
1. Most of the time I read them if they seem relevant to me, sometimes they don't, so I just kinda like, ignore them or don't open them. And I feel like I get a lot of them so most, sometimes they just get ignored. But if it comes from like my healthy vet or something like that, then I'm usually looking at it because it's a communication that I've had, with a provider or something. So I wanna get back with them.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. What kind of me emails are you getting from my healthy vet?
1. **Participant 12**
1. Usually when I send a message to, my provider, when they respond, it'll say I have a new message waiting.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. And how do you feel about the types of communications that you're getting from the va what is your preference? Like as far as like letters, emails, text messaging, letters are fine emails.
1. **Participant 12**
1. If it's Myhealthy vet. That is ok. The emails that come in that are like newsletter type things. I don't really read them that much but I mean, I have reference back to them, like, if something about pay or something like that, I'll go back and like, do a search like, oh, they did say this was gonna happen or whatever. So, I mean, I don't have feelings either way. I mean, ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, that's fair. Well, to get started, we're gonna just move into the, the next part of the session today and it's gonna feel, it might feel a little repetitive as far as the questioning goes. But we're gonna look through, some existing emails that are going out from the va, but before we show you the email, we're going to just kind of run through a scenario and see if you've currently received something like that or if you haven't, what you would expect that email to contain and then we'll get your feedback on what is currently being sent out. Does that sound good?
1. **Participant 12**
1. Yeah, sure.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. I, I just had one follow up question. I wanted to ask just real quick, P12 you mentioned that that sometimes mail mail from the VA went to spam. Do you remember? Does it, do you, does it stick in your mind or do you remember what kinds of emails from the VA go to your spam?
1. **Participant 12**
1. Usually like the mass like newsletter type emails that come through and I wouldn't say it's, and it just goes to I have gmail. So like sorts it to like promotion or something about like maybe social like it doesn't just come to my inbox directly.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Ok. Got it. Understood. Thanks for the clarification. That's it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Well, to get started. Can you tell us about your experience receiving debt related emails from the va debt related? Yeah. Debt like D-E-B-T.
1. **Participant 12**
1. I never got a debt. I don't know that I've ever gotten one of those in the E through email.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Ok. Well let's imagine that you do receive an email that is debt related. What kind of content or information would you like that email to contain that would help you understand what the they're asking of you and to make it clear what you need to?
1. **Participant 12**
1. I guess I would need to know what the debts for, why I have inccrued one, I guess. Or like, why do I have one? And then you know, what do I need to do to take care of it? Like a phone number that's like a direct phone number to someone that can help me? Not like a 1-800 number that's probably gonna go to some route to some random place and I have to go through 10,000, you know, prompts to get to where I need to go.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. Well, I'm going to have my coworker Ian share his screen. And we did not create these emails. So again, feel free to just look them through, give us your opinion. So let's say that you received this email here. What do you think it's about? And is there anything that you would do from here?
1. **Participant 12**
1. Mm. I don't know. It's so vague. I would probably try to go and find out what it is because it just kind of, if I look at the hyperlink, I guess it does say va debt, but like, I mean, initially I would probably, I might even ignore it initially just because it doesn't say anything, my sense of urgency would be lower because I don't really know what it is.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. Well, let's say that you received this email here and then shortly after that you receive this next email and for the sake of this example, we're gonna show them on the same screen so you can see them side by side. What would your thoughts be? And what actions would you take if any?
1. **Participant 12**
1. So I got the first one first, then I got the second one.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yeah, shortly after that.
1. **Participant 12**
1. Oh, I would, I would go to the site and find out what it's about because it gives me more information.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. The second one provides more information?
1. **Participant 12**
1. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Can you kind of expand on that? Which which part is you, you have, you will also relieve a letter who didn't management?
1. **Participant 12**
1. Like debt means I owe money. So I'm like, ok, let me find out what this is about. So I would click on the link and log in and see what's going on.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. So the Debt Management Center being in the, the text is a key item for you to identify.
1. **Participant 12**
1. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Ian do you wanna?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Absolutely. Absolutely. All right, P12. So, we're gonna pull back the curtain here a little bit and let you know that, the first one is actually the message that a veteran would get when they have a copay for, you know, a doctor's visit or, you know, whatever, if there's a, there's an outstanding bill from, from, a, a hospital appointment. Ok. And the second one is, the, the communication a veteran would get if they had an overpayment, let's say a beneficiary turned 19 and then they were no longer eligible, to be, part of the, the, benefit payments. But for whatever reason, the va, you know, didn't, you know, didn't, didn't update the records, and, and, and you got overpaid. So knowing those, knowing that what, what would you, what would you expect to see in these emails?
1. **Participant 12**
1. Well, the first one I would expect to see, you know, like I just say like, hey, you have a new, like a new, like a new bill or something like that or something. Like, just so I know the second one, I would expect it to maybe say, I mean, what it says now is fine. It would definitely prompt me either way. So I would go look at that probably quicker. But the first one, I mean, if it's just a bill, I mean, like just say that, I guess.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah. Ok. Ok. And then, and then for the second one, would you want anything, anything different? For the second one?
1. **Participant 12**
1. I mean, not really because debt management already gets my attention. But I mean, if you, you could add something like, you know, there's a possible overpayment, you know, that's like another key keyword that would probably trigger me, but I think debt management obviously would just, I I'll be like, ok, what's going on here?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Ok. Ok, great. Thanks for that.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Do you have any further feedback that you wanna provide on this or are you OK to move forward, P12?
1. **Participant 12**
1. Yeah, we can move forward.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. I just wanna make sure we captured all of your, your your thoughts here. So, for the next email type that we're gonna talk about, can you tell us if you have experience appealing a decision from the va regarding your benefits, for example?
1. **Participant 12**
1. No, no, I haven't. I haven't gone through the whole process. No.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Well, let's say that you did appeal a decision that the va made about your benefits and they sent you a communication about it. What kind of information would you expect to see in that that email?
1. **Participant 12**
1. For it to say, hey, you know, a decision has been made or decision is in progress or something about your appeal like something about that situation should be in the email. So I know exactly what to do and then like click on a link here to find out more details or something.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. Well, with this same scenario, you know, you've appealed this decision that the va made about your benefits and you receive an email. We're gonna show you an email now and let us know what types of questions you have about it and if there's anything you would do from here, I mean it looks fine to me.
1. **Participant 12**
1. I mean like it gives me all the details. I need who I need to what I need to do next. It appears to be pretty fine…
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. P12. I I think you might have muted in the middle of it.
1. **Participant 12**
1. Did you hear me? I said it it appears to be pretty thorough. It gives me a lot of information. Can you hear me?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yep.
1. **Participant 12**
1. Ok. It gives me a lot of information about what to do next like next steps to tell me what this email is about. Yeah, I mean, I I mean I think it's fine. Mhm.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And do you have any further questions on this email type?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah. No, if so what would if what if anything would you do from here?
1. **Participant 12**
1. I would click on the link to see what the status is next.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Ok. Ok, great, thanks.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. So we're gonna move on and look at another email type. Let's say that you submitted a document to the va and something went wrong in the process, for example, like a background system error and it caused the document that you submitted to not be filed. And you receive an email, what kind of details would you want or expect that email to include?
1. **Participant 12**
1. I would want it to give me like an like more of a kind of like, hey, there's a problem with, you know, your recent submission. That way it kind of like triggers me to think like, ok, something's wrong. That way I need to get on it really quickly because if it just says check the status, then I may be like, oh, I just did it. So I figure it's probably nothing but like something that tells me like there was a problem or yeah, something that tells me there was a problem with my recent submission.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Well, let's say that this is the email you receive. This is a kind of a long email. So when you get to the bottom, if you just give us a heads up, Ian can scroll down to the bottom for you, but you know, look through it, let us know if there's anything that you find confusing if you're provided with enough information. If this was what you expected to see, ok, you can scroll down.
1. **Participant 12**
1. I guess it's a little frustrating because I don't know what to do. Like I just, I, something was wrong but I don't really know. Was it something I did or was it just like a batch error with a bunch of, like, people that were submitting things? Kind of seems that way. But it kind of doesn't really make me feel good about the fact that my submission was sent. So, like, what do I need? Like, what do I need to do? I, I probably would call the number or whatever but yeah, it just doesn't make me feel like it's like I feel like I should do something.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Ian, do you mind scrolling up a little? Is there anywhere? And the email where you'd wanna see some sort of like what you're supposed to do or, or clarify the confusion that you're having a little more.
1. **Participant 12**
1. I mean, it says like, you know, what should I do? And this is no action needed for me at this time. Like I get that, but like, I guess the first part is where I'm like, the first paragraph is like the Department of Veterans Affairs da da da is identified a failure to establish claim based on your past submission. Like, what did I do wrong? Like what, what like, I don't know.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. So it's just not clear enough is that…
1. **Participant 12**
1. I mean, it is, but it's just like, it's really like, annoying because I feel like, I don't know if I did something wrong or like, I just feel like like I'm in limbo.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. OK. What kind of information or wording would help? Feel like, make you feel a little bit more, like, solidified or like, you're like, having a better understanding of, of what's happened.
1. **Participant 12**
1. I don't know, like I get why they probably sent this because it's probably something wrong with the system. But like, it really is kind of stressful. Like, I don't even know if I need to know this until you fixed it, like until you figure out what's the next step. Like, I don't know, like I, I get the reason why this is probably going out just like to cover their ass, I guess. But like it's more like just come to me when you know what the solution is because right now it's just like, oh, we, we've identified a problem, we're looking at it now starts stressing me out a little bit.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. I get it. You have to that there. You had to, you get to sit and wait. Right. And that's, that's not fun.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Right. Got it. Ian, do you have any further questions on this one?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah. And I only oh jeez. Mm. No. Yeah. No, we covered it. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Yep. All right. Ok. Well, we'll move on to the next one. so question, have you ever schedule an appointment at a VA facility?
1. **Participant 12**
1. Yeah, I have,
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. It seems like a silly question, but I, I have to at least ask.
1. **Participant 12**
1. Right.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. And so when you schedule an appointment or appointments, did you receive any type of email communication regarding the appointments?
1. **Participant 12**
1. It depends on the kind. So if it's like one of those ones online, I get an email, like, right before it's about to happen or they, I think maybe I get an email, like when they schedule it, if it's like a virtual one. But if it's like a in person, I just get a letter in the mail.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And I don't know, it's totally fine if you don't recall the experience. But if you do, you know, can you try and talk us through like what the experience was receiving the email communication?
1. **Participant 12**
1. It was just kinda like, hey, your appointment has been scheduled for this date with this provider and here's a link, you know, I don't, I don't have a real experience other than that I got it, you know.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Do you recall feeling that you were provided with enough information?
1. **Participant 12**
1. Yeah, because like I can always go back and I like, I, I kind of like that because I can always like go back to my email and I can like search and see like, oh, I know I got an appointment coming up. I don't know when it is so like I'll just look for it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, nice. Well, let's say that you receive this email about your appointment. And please note that like this version might look a little different than what you are used to seeing. But for the sake of today, this is the one we're going to be looking at. Just kind of look it over and let us know if you're provided enough information. If there's anything that you find confusing about this email or if you feel like anything is out of place, anything like that? Just kind of, it's a long one as well, so I will have to scroll.
1. **Participant 12**
1. Ok. Ok. You can scroll down. I mean, it's fine. No major, I guess, issues with it. It gives me all the information I need. The only thing that was confusing was that first one at the top, it said something about before your appointment, call the va call the facility to validate the time. Like I don't know what that means.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. What would, what would you assume it means? I don't know what it means either. Just being honest.
1. **Participant 12**
1. That my appointment is not confirmed, but it says it is. So it's like, ok, is it confirmed or not?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. So it kind of makes you question like either why that's here. I'm I'm trying let me know if I'm, I just wanna make sure that I'm hearing correctly. So, so it kind of is making you wonder if it is confirmed or if that line was accidentally put in here or?
1. **Participant 12**
1. Yeah, like it's just like, why was it, why, why do I need to, why do I need to confirm before my appointment? Like if it's, I mean, it's already confirmed.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. Ian, do you have any questions for P12?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Oh, yeah, just seeing that thing that says that says you should call, would you call or would you just go to your appointment?
1. **Participant 12**
1. I would just go to my appointment. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. All right, cool. That's it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. P12. Anything else you wanna, talk about on this email type?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. No.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. So have you ever received an email from the va that something on your va profile needs to be updated? Ok, like, have you ever received an email type like that from the va that something needs to be updated in your va profile?
1. **Participant 12**
1. Trying to think? No.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok, let's say that like, you need to confirm your mailing address or update your mailing address and they send you an email. What kind of information would you wanna see in that message to make that point clear?
1. **Participant 12**
1. Just tell me straight out, put your email, we need your email address updated for XYZ or whatever.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. Well, same scenario. Let's say that this is the email that you receive for that situation. You need to confirm or update your mailing address and this is what you see let us know what kind of questions you would have if you receive this and also is there anything you would do from here? Yeah. Mhm.
1. **Participant 12**
1. Yeah, I would just go in there and click on the link and update my profile. Ok. Hm.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. I'm sorry. Were you about to say something?
1. **Participant 12**
1. No, I just coughed. No. Oh, ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. I just want to make sure. All right. So, so you feel that this email is pretty, pretty good and it would meet your needs? It makes sense.
1. **Participant 12**
1. It's straightforward. Yeah.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. And do you have any questions? Yeah, P12.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Let's so, so basically what, what's happened here is they've sent you some mail and it got returned to sender. So they're assuming that your, your, your contact information is outdated like you probably moved, right? And let's say you follow the link and it turns out your email address is correct. What would you do? What, what if anything would you do then?
1. **Participant 12**
1. Nothing.
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Ok. Ok, great, thanks.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. This next email type is a little niche. So if you haven't received anything like it, we probably will just skip over it. But have you ever received a notice of disagreement email from the va?
1. **Participant 12**
1. I don't think so.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. We'll just move on to the next one. And this next one, it's our last one. Have you ever received an email about your va Life insurance?
1. **Participant 12**
1. I don't have the VA life insurance, I don't think. Ok, so, no, I haven't got in communication. They've maybe asked me about it. I think they probably sent me. Yeah, I think I've gotten stuff like they probably offered it. Ok.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Well, let's say that you have the VA Life insurance and a change was made to your account and then you receive an email. What type of like content or information would you want in that message?
1. **Participant 12**
1. I just want to see the details in the email about what, what I should expect to see when I click on the link or something like that. So I would probably think it's say, you know, your life insurance, you know, blah, blah, blah is has pending changes or upcoming changes. Just something to give me a heads up about what's the reason for them to reach out about my life insurance?
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. Well, let's say this is the email you receive. Let us know if you have any questions about this or if there's anything you would do from here.
1. **Participant 12**
1. Ok. No, I think that's good. It kind of sounds like I made the change and they're like letting me know that they've made the change like it says if you did not initiate this request. Yeah, so yeah, I think, I mean, I think it's good. Ok, it makes sense. I would go on there and I probably wouldn't do anything because I probably knew I already called and made a change, but if not, I would go on there and see what the changes are.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. All right. Nice. Ian, do you have any questions about this one?
1. **Interviewer 2:**
1. Yeah. No, that's it.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
1. Ok. All right. Well, P12, is there anything else that you would like to share with us that we didn't already cover today?
1. **Participant 12**
1. No, I don't think so. Ok. I think everything was pretty easy.
1. **Interviewer 1:**
