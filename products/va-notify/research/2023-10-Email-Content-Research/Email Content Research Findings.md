## Research Goals

Our research on email content is extremely broad and fairly universal, it fits into all of the moments of the Veteran Journey, from Getting out through Dying. It encompasses any time a Veteran receives an email from the VA.  
  
We are trying to discover how much information Veterans want in their emails. We are also trying to discover if the level of information they want in their emails depends on the type of email they are receiving.  
  

## Research Questions

-   How much information do Veterans want in their emails
    
-   Does the amount of information they want depend on the type of email they are receiving?
    

  

## Methodology

  

1.  Our methodology will be a remote moderated interview of Veterans where we will  
    Set up mock scenarios (eg. Imagine you’ve just applied for benefits and you receive the following notice.) and ask the Veteran what type of information they would expect to receive from the VA.
    
2.  After discussing what they would expect, we will show them an example of an existing VA and ask them to share their thoughts on the level of detail in the notification.
    

  
  
  

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

1.  Veterans want more information in their emails instead of requiring them to login in order to get all of the information.  
    i. TRUE - Almost without exception, Veterans wanted more information in their emails
    
2.  Veterans will want different amounts of information based on the type of email.  
    i. FALSE - Almost without exception Veterans wanted as much information as possible in all email communications.
    

  
## Key Findings

  

1. Veterans wanted more information and/or context in all of their emails (11 of 11)

  

2. Personalization increased Veteran confidence in the email’s authenticity.

  

3. Additional context (amounts, decisions, department of origin, etc.) increased Veteran confidence in authenticity as well as engagement. Veterans were much more likely to respond to emails with details.

  

4. Users were frustrated by needing to login in order to find out what an email was about.

  

5. Lack of details (such as what the email was regarding or the amount owed) in debt related emails caused considerable anxiety for Veterans

  

6. Receiving too many similar emails or if the email lacked applicable content, participants mentioned either they would ignore or just flat out delete the email without reading it.

  

7. Conflicting information between the subject and the content of emails caused confusion for participants.

  

8. Emails that lacked a clear, and concise call-to-action were frustrating and confusing.

  

9. Participants want direct points of contact rather than generic contact information.

**Brief description:** When Veterans were given a verbal description of a type of notification and then asked what sort of details they would expect to see in that notification, they almost always listed more information than is contained in any of the examples we showed.

> _Supporting data: “It just says you have information available from the VA, but that's it, you know, what is it about? Is it about my, you know, my claim? Is it about my medical stuff? You know, is it about payments? Just, this is basically useless, it doesn't tell me anything.” - P5_

> _Supporting data: “it's just a typical thing you're gonna get from the VA that doesn't tell you much unfortunately. [...] I think again, it's, it's nice if it's, if it's kind of spelled out because when you look, I mean, when you look at these, they both look the same.” - P11_

> _Supporting data: “If it's just a bill, I mean, like just say that, I guess.” - P1_

> _Supporting data: “[...] be clear about what it is.” - P2_

> _Supporting data: “What might be reasonable would be at least an inkling as to, like, is this an education benefit related thing? [...]you know, like what sort of that it might be related to.” -P2_

  
  

### **Finding 2. Personalization increased Veteran confidence in the email’s authenticity.**

**Brief description:** Participants expressed that they want messages specific to them to be personalized with their name and other high level information. Doing this would increase their trust that the email was not spam.

> _Supporting data: “Usually when I see that “Dear Veteran” I pay a little less attention because that's what they put on the mass mailers that they do to everybody. [...] if it's more like personalized with your name saying, yeah, this is an issue for you, it would probably make you pay a little more attention.” - P4_

> _Supporting data: “I would not like it to say “Dear Veteran.” I would like to have it addressed to me personally because if you just have a generic address, I'm more likely to think that it's fraud.” - P7_

  
  

### **Finding 3: Additional context (amounts, decisions, department of origin, etc.) increased Veteran confidence in authenticity as well as engagement. Veterans were much more likely to respond to emails with details.**

**Brief description:** Emails that were scant on context were dismissed as spam or bulk emails that weren’t related to them.

 > _Supporting data: “Just kind of make it more legit so it doesn't seem kind of like a spam email.”_

> _Supporting data: “I don't necessarily think I would click on this link from this email because the email seems kind of a a little too bland. It doesn't even like at the bottom you can't really like is it, is it kind of, it, it almost looks like a spam email. If if I were to receive something like this, I wouldn't click on the link.”_



### **Finding 4: Users were frustrated by needing to login in order to find out what an email was about.**

**Brief description:** Users wanted the information in the email, not behind the login, it felt like an unnecessary step.  
  
> _Supporting data: “To me this sucks to, you know, it's like, it's like a, it doesn't tell me anything. Want you to log in and, and log in is a hassle because you have two factor and all that other crap. It's not just a simple click. You gotta like actually log in and that takes time and, you know, if they, if you know, maybe and then it, and then half the time it's like, doesn't apply to you, you know, so you just wasted that time logging in and doing two factors for no reason. They should at least give you a bit more about what it is about.” - P5_

> _Supporting data: “Logging in is a convoluted process still. So I don't wanna do it until I'm sitting down and can do my verification and stuff. So I would probably dismiss it, delete it and just figure next time I log in, I'll try to remember to look for that.” - P2_

  
### Finding 5: Lack of details (such as what the email was regarding or the amount owed) in debt related emails caused considerable anxiety for Veterans.  
  
Labels: [AUD: Veterans](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/AUD%3A%20Veterans), [AUD: Caregivers](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/AUD%3A%20Caregivers), [PRDT: VA-notify](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/PRDT%3A%20VA-notify), [RESRCH: Interviews](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/RESRCH%3A%20Interviews), [RESRCH: Remote](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/RESRCH%3A%20Remote), [DSP: Notifications](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/DSP%3A%20Notifications), [PRDT: Debt-portal](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/PRDT%3A%20Debt-portal), [PRDT: Content](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/PRDT%3A%20Content)

**Brief description:** Using the phrase “Debt Management Center” without giving any other context gave Veterans anxiety because they didn’t know what was going on and often assumed the worst (one thought they had been sent to collections).

> _Supporting data: “And so the whole process with debt was significantly challenging because, I think we've had people commit suicide over a debt that shouldn't have been, you know, a debt that shouldn't have happened. And, and so they, they've wound up with this debt and not knowing how to deal with it and knowing it isn't valid. And I think we've had people die over it.” -P7”_

> _Supporting data: “It's more of a stress out moment because the only thing you see is the debt part. Like, what do I owe the VA? And that is like, it's kind of like, what is it now? Like, I'm sorry, do I wanna be stressed out in this moment or is there like, do I wanna deal with this?” -P3_  
  
> _Supporting data: “And the second one, like I said, will make my stomach drop. I got a debt and you owe the VA some money. Mhm. They saying that they overpaid you and you didn't know it. Oh my God. That would, that would, that's devastation right there.” -P8_  
  
  
### Finding 6: Receiving too many similar emails or if the email lacked applicable content, participants mentioned either they would ignore or just flat out delete the email without reading it.

**Brief description:** Participants noted they would delete emails without reading them if they felt it was something they had already received or a generic/general message. They would also ignore emails that seemed too vague or they felt were spam.

> _Supporting data: “So they just get deleted. Sometimes I don't even open them. Which, I'm realizing, means that it's not working. So yeah, I guess it is not working in that sense because if I'm conditioned to the point that I delete an email before I read it, then that is ineffective communication.” P-2_  
  
> _Supporting data: “Confirm your, confirm your mailing address on file, even though it already is. But that's exact, like same thing it says every time you sign in. [...] it does with mine. I know the address is fine. But yeah, I see that all the time.” P-4_

> _Supporting data: “They have a tendency to send 234 emails about the same thing.” P-4_

> _Supporting data: “I don't know. It's so vague. I would probably try to go and find out what it is because it just kind of, if I look at the hyperlink, I guess it does say VA debt, but like, I mean, initially I would probably, I might even ignore it initially just because it doesn't say anything. My sense of urgency would be lower because I don't really know what it is.” P-12_

  

### Finding 7: Conflicting information between subject and the content of emails caused confusion for participants.  
  
Labels: [AUD: Veterans](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/AUD%3A%20Veterans), [AUD: Caregivers](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/AUD%3A%20Caregivers), [PRDT: VA-notify](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/PRDT%3A%20VA-notify), [RESRCH: Interviews](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/RESRCH%3A%20Interviews), [RESRCH: Remote](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/RESRCH%3A%20Remote), [DSP: Notifications](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/DSP%3A%20Notifications), [PRDT: Content](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/PRDT%3A%20Content)

**Brief description:** Participants noted instances where emails had conflicting information, such as, ‘no further action is needed’ followed by links to contacts. Or, an email that is alerting the participant that something is confirmed, but then instructs them to call to confirm.

> _Supporting data: “It's kind of, you know, the way it's worded. They say, well, you don't need to take any action, but there's a problem with your claim, is what they're basically telling you. Just kinda, and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't just sit there and go, okay, I guess they'll take care of it.” -P4_  
> _Supporting data: “I'm not gonna call and confirm my appointment. That's the point of this email.” -P2_

> _Supporting data: “My appointment is not confirmed? But it says it is. So it's like, ok, is it confirmed or not?” -P12_

> _Supporting data: “The letters are fine. I can, you know, set them aside as reminders, but sometimes the, the text messages are kinda like, ok, I just confirmed this the other day. You're hitting me with this again? Why do I have to reconfirm? So, yeah, that kind of becomes a nuisance.” -P10_

> _Supporting data: “They seem to have a lot of links to people to talk to, which kind of goes against the thing of no action is needed, but they have a whole lot of resources for you to actually talk to about it.” -P4_

> _Supporting data: “This says nothing about this says nothing about whether you're granted or you're approved or denied. It just says to look for your status. And, I think, if you wish to contact the board of directors, that's not relevant to checking the status, why would you call the board of directors? Contact the board of directors or submit a statement if you just want a status.” -P9_

  
  

### Finding 8: Emails that lacked a clear, concise call-to-action were frustrating and confusing.

**Brief description:** When participants viewed emails that did not have a clear, and concise call-to-action left feeling unsure about what was expected of them and what their next steps should be.

> _Supporting data: ““The bottom [list of links] is a lot of needless words and if you said there's an error, then you, you would probably wanna have a link to the website to where that error is, or wherever that department that's confirming that error, so you know what's related to.” -P9_

> _Supporting data: “I would probably not click and link because it could be anything, it could be some routine thing and it likely is because that's the sort of thing that one would get with some vague message like that.” - P2_

> _Supporting data: “[...] it's super bland, so I wouldn't click the link or anything in this email.” -P6_

> _Supporting data: “I guess it's a little frustrating because I don't know what to do.” -P12_

  

### Finding 9: Participants want direct points of contact rather than generic contact information.

**Brief description:** Most participants mentioned how much time it takes them to navigate to the correct contact when they need to reach out to the VA. They want a direct number or actual person they can chat with online.

> _Supporting data: “You'll notice when it says clinic contact information, unless the clinic is this specific number for both in mine, it just gives me the generic switchboard number of the hospital. So even if I call it in, I have to then get routed to somebody in appointments.” -P7_

> _Supporting data: “Have the extension to get to the proper place.” -P8_

> _Supporting data: “Point of contact phone number to call somebody at the VA directly.” -P4_

> _Supporting data: “Like a phone number that's like a direct phone number to someone that can help me.” -P12_

> _Supporting data: “it would be nice if it's a direct number or when you do go to the website that they can get you, the person that could give you the answers.” -P11_

  
  
  

## Additional Insights

Frustration with lack of internal integrations at the VA with things that seem like they should be able to be universally applied:

-   Appointment Confirmation
    
-   VA Profile information  
      
    

Consistency in tone, branding, and formatting across all forms of communication increase trust in authenticity.  
  

Logging in is a pain point for Veterans

  

## Recommendations

  

  
  

**MORE CONTEXT**  
Include as much contextual detail (eg. copay, overpayment, amount, date, decision, address, direct POC, doctor, department, type of appointment, phone number & ext. etc. )as possible. This will inform and help set expectations of what a Veteran will see when they log in to review information or take an action (without stepping on PII or HIPAA).

_Veterans expressed a range of emotions including frustration, irritation, exasperation, resignation and even fear when emails lacked detail._  
  

**PERSONALIZATION**  
Personalization for all email communications should address the Veteran by their first name.

_Veterans thought that emails that didn’t address them personally were either spam or bulk emails they could ignore_

  
**FORMATTING CONSISTENCY**  
Use templates and consistent language and formatting will increase Veteran confidence in authenticity  

_Emails that were scant on formatting or missing a footer were dismissed as likely scam emails._
  
  
**DEVELOP OPT IN/OUT FUNCTIONALITY FOR EMAILS**
Participants had experiences of receiving more email communications than they would prefer. This was especially true for appointment reminders.  
  
_Participants mentioned the frequency or lack of applicable content would cause them to ignore or just flat out delete the email without reading it._

  
**ALL COMMUNICATIONS SHOULD BE WORKSHOPPED WITH VETERANS**  
Our research only included a few samples from different business lines but going forward, all communications should hew to exciting research recommendations and or guidelines and any new styles or substantively different content should be evaluated by Veterans.  
  

## Next Steps
Develop content guidelines informed by the findings of this research.


## Further research needed
Our research contained sample email from different business lines but was by no means comprehensive. We recommend that research be done for all existing and any new types of communication with Veterans to validate that communications with them are optimized for tone, clarity, branding, content, and usability.
