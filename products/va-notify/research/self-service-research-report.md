# Digital Notifications Self Service Research Report

Prepared by Todd Stanich on February 9, 2021

## Summary
Self service capabilities are desired by existing users of VANotify. The most common need across user roles is the ability to make content changes and updates to templates. Participants expressed differing expectations about the notifications governance process with the majority expecting or finding some value in a timely review of their changes. Transparency into how notifications are performing is important for increasing confidence in the platform and providing valuable data to improve the Veteran experience.


## Goals
The goal of this research is to understand usersâ€™ needs and expectations for creating, updating, and managing email and text message notifications internally at the VA.  

## Hypotheses
1. Self service of email and text message notifications is a desired capability by most business line users of the VANotify platform.  
2. Creating new notifications and changing content of existing notifications are the primary use cases for self service.  
3. Reviewing notifications, their content and where they fit into the Veteran user journey are some initial concepts to be considered regarding governance.
4. Self service needs include the ability to check logs, see reporting around notifications and address notification cost.


## Methodology
Moderated remote interviews over Zoom with participants who have engaged with the VANotify team to send email or text message notifications.

**Participants**  
Seven interviews were conducted representing a diverse group of internal VA employees and contractors.
- Three business line representatives
- Two product managers
- One developer
- One content editor
- Three male
- Four female

## Findings

### Themes

### All participants expressed an interest in some form of self service capability. The most common need is the ability to make small content changes to templates.

#### Key Takeaways
- The method of self service (ex: UI vs API) varied by role. The majority of participants expected a UI to perform self service tasks while some were okay with using an API.
- The most common self service need among participants was the ability to quickly make small content changes without having to send the changes to a VANotify team member to implement.
- Additional self service needs identified by participants include locating template IDs (and other necessary API details), viewing existing templates so new templates can be based off of them, viewing metrics and analytics, bulk email sending, and defining the content type of a message so preferences can be appropriately applied.

#### Quotes

"It makes me feel bad to bother people to make small changes. I probably sent five emails in one day." - P6

"The content, which is owned by the business line, we [business line] really should be allowed to update it." - P2

"There does seem to be a lot of back and forth on making small tweaks to templates, particularly a word change." - P5

"Here's the dream for the UI, if you can have the current template string on one side and then the rendering on the other side, so you can see, live updates of what you're doing." - P6

"We need to have good templates. We need to have a template that users or teams can use to replicate across their business line or their benefit, knowing that there might be some different use cases where some language tweaks would need to happen. - P4



### Participants had differing perspectives on the expected role of oversight and standards regarding their notifications.

#### Key Takeaways
- The majority of participants either expect or are understanding of a required review before template is able to be used for Veteran communication. It is expected any reviews would be completed in a timely manner (24 hours was suggested by multiple participants as reasonable).
- Business lines generally have their own content approval workflows before passing content on to be implemented.
- Some participants value input and a checkpoint from the VANotify team for feedback on best practices.

#### Quotes
"I don't want VA Notify to become too easy to use that anyone can send a notification. I want people to be thoughtful about what they are sending." - P5

"I don't want to make changes without VANotify having eyes on it." - P6

"If we're not aware of what other teams are sending, the Veterans could be getting very different voice and messages from VA. Someone needs to make that call for all VA teams" - P3

### Transparency into platform and notification performance improves confidence in digital notifications as well as drives understanding and improvement of the Veteran experience. Both of which ultimately make the case for increased yet intentional investment in digital notifications.

#### Key Takeaways
- Two main categories of metrics were identified as needs by participants - performance metrics and notification analytics.
- Product and development users valued access to performance metrics to increase their confidence that the notifications are being sent and delivered as expected. Examples of these metrics include total notifications sent, number successful, number failed.
- Business line, product, and content users valued individual notifications analytics understand the effectiveness of each notification and identify areas of improvement. These analytics were also identified as valuable when advocating for a shift to digital notifications over paper letters. Examples of these analytics include volume, open rate, click through rate, and unsubscribe rate.

#### Quotes
"[These metrics are] vital information we would use to evaluate the effectiveness of our business process" - P1

"I would use these metrics to take to leadership to advocate for digital notifications." - P2

"We would be able to report interactions with Veterans to Congress" - P7

"View successful and failed emails so we know everything is working right and we can sleep a little better at night" - P5



### Additional findings
- The existing workflow by teams interacting with VANotify is heavily reliant on emails and Slack messages. Participants were okay with this way of working, but noted they may be receiving extra attention as an early adopter and would not expect this method to scale. Some participants expected or preferred tracking requests in a ticketing system.
- The existing process for text changes to physical letters is complex and takes a long time. That process prevents quick reaction by business lines to changing legislation and information. It is not a process recommended for making changes to digital notifications.
- The process for making changes to VA.gov was praised for the ability to quickly react and make changes as they arise.
- Contact centers are an important user group to keep informed about all notifications being sent to Veterans.
- The role making changes to notifications changes based on the tools available. For example, today, developers are making text changes. If a UI were available, many participants envisioned content editors to make the changes directly.


## Recommendations
- Move forward with self service capabilities. The ability to make content changes to existing messages will have the greatest initial impact across all user types interviewed.
- Develop a governance model that enables a quick turnaround while providing valuable standards based feedback.
- Expose notification and platform metrics to teams using the platform.
- Develop and make accessible content templates for different scenarios (ex: confirmation) to give teams a consistent starting place.



## Future research opportunities
- Conduct usability testing on potential self service solutions and workflows.
- Many participants struggled to come up with a full list of metrics they would value in their workflow. Consider research with additional stimulus and examples to further understand what metrics are worth investing in.
- Consider research with contact center representatives to understand the amount of information needed to speak to Veterans about notifications they receive.
