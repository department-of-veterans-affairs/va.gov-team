**We conducted 4-30 minute usability sessions with a clickable prototype of the “Sample Template” feature with  Zoom screen sharing. We gave the participants a set of tasks to complete while thinking aloud.**

**Some scenarios were:**
-   **If you were trying to create an email notification, how would you do that**
-   **If you were stuck (with a blank page) what would you do?**

**Based on the sessions conducted, we validated that the sample template feature is quick, intuitive and easy to use. Some common trends we heard were that the process was streamlined,  straightforward,  and they loved the tool.**
