# Disability Compensation Notifications Research Report

Prepared by Todd Stanich on July 30, 2020

## Summary
Throughout the disability compensation application process, participants expressed many frustrations. Some of these pain points related to a lack of communication, understanding of what is happening with their claim, and what is needed from them. Participants did not find existing paper letter notifications to be sufficient for all communication throughout the application process. Email notifications were considered by all participants in the study as more timely, efficient, and convenient when compared to paper letter notifications. Text message notifications were not considered sufficient to replace letters or emails and instead viewed as a way to enhance the application experience with brief communications such as status updates or appointment reminders.

## Goals
The goals below were studied in context of the disability compensation application process.
- Understand what information Veterans expect and value in a notification
- Determine when email vs text message vs paper letter notifications are most appropriate
- Understand when Veteran expect to receive notifications

## Methodology
Interviews were conducted with eight Veterans over four days (July 22-24 & 28). During the interviews, Veterans were asked about their experience applying for Disability Compensation benefits while viewing a journey map of the process that included screenshots and sample letters as visual stimulus. Throughout the discussion of their experience, participants were asked specifically about notifications (email, text message, and paper letters).

**Participants**
- Veterans
- Three female and Five male
- Between the ages of 18-74

## Findings

### Themes

### Paper letter notifications are not meeting all Veterans' needs.
Paper letters are the main method of notifications today for Veterans working through the disability compensation application process. These paper notifications sometimes do not arrive in a timely manner and some Veterans shared barriers that prevent them from easily and frequently checking their mail.

#### Key Takeaways
- Several participants mentioned paper letters not arriving in a timely manner. Letters sometimes arrived after a Veteran was aware of their decision, already received a deposit, or after an important date had already passed.
- One participant described how access to their mailbox and paper letters is a burden compared to the ease of email.
- Some participants mentioned not receiving certain expected paper letters.

#### Quotes
“Sending us a letter and receiving it after the deadline for submitting additional information doesn’t help at all. And sometimes we don’t even receive the letter” - P2

“The payment was in my account before I received the letter” - P3

“I have to catch the bus to go to the post office 10 miles away [to check my mail]. Email is much better for me” - P4

“I happened to check my bank account and noticed a deposit. I did some research and found out it was from the VA. About a week or so later, that’s when I got the letter. It would have been nice if I received an email saying a decision was made so I didn’t have to go research” - P5

“The other issues is the time delay. It takes days to receive this [paper letter] and days to respond.” - P7

### Email notifications are expected and the preferred method of receiving information.
We observed a positive response from participants about the idea of email notifications throughout the disability compensation process. Many participants have come to expect email notifications as part of their online transactions. All participants were interested in receiving emails throughout their disability compensation application experience either in addition or in place of the existing paper letters.

#### Key Takeaways
- All participants were interested in receiving email notifications throughout the disability compensation process.
- Some participants would prefer to only receive emails and not paper letters while others would like to receive both.
- Most participants expected email notifications based on interactions with other services.
- Some participants wanted all content of the paper letters in emails while others only wanted a subset of information without sensitive personal details.

#### Quotes
“Email everything, make it simple. It is a nightmare, you get a letter, go to your mailbox and that letter might have been sitting there for a week.” - P4

“Everything I’ve ever done on the VA website has come to me in letter form. Which I find wasteful of paper, money, and time. All I really need is an official email with this information. I don’t want to keep boxes of VA documents around in 2020” - P7

“An email would be great. You can respond faster to an email” - P2

“Email is by far the best suited [vs text] for having a record or evidence if you ever have to go back and prove you submitted this application. Text messages tend to get buried and they’re not as accessible to search or access” - P7



### Certain text messages may enhance the Veteran experience, but should not replace paper or email notifications.
Text messages were received with less enthusiasm from participants when compared to email notifications. Participants felt text messages were difficult to reference later or save and they did not feel text messages could communicate as much information as an email or paper letter. Text messages do offer opportunities to enhance the Veteran experience through point-in-time updates and brief communication.

#### Key Takeaways
- All participants viewed text message notifications as something in addition to email or paper letters and not a replacement.
- Some participants were not interested in receiving text messages at all.
- Participants interested in text message notifications mentioned small messages or updates as the ideal use case such as appointment reminders and claim status updates.
- Participants viewed text messages as point-in-time communications and not something easily saved or referenced again at a later date. For this reason, most participants did not see text messages as a suitable communication method for information they might want to save.


#### Quotes
“Lately I’ve been signing in about once every two or three days to check on a current disability claim I have. If the status changed and I automatically got an email or text then I could go look to see what the status is.” - P5

“I could print out or save an email if I need to refer back to it. Whereas text messages are more instant and I like seeing that, but it is probably not something I would depend on to keep or refer back to in the future. After I get so many text messages on my phone I end up deleting them.” - P6

“Not a text message, this is an awful lot to put in a text message. An email I can refer back to, I’d be perfectly happy receiving it that way.” - P8

“Maybe every couple weeks [I logged in to check the status]” - P8

### Additional findings
- Some participants do not trust or know how to check if a text message is from a legitimate source.
- Some participants called or visited the VA when they were not clear about the status of their claim.
- Participants have different levels of comfort with personal information being communicated through email and text messages. Some participants want everything in an email. Others only wan’t basic information in an email notification and directions to where the full information can be viewed online.
- None of the participants found the need for notifications about when their payment has been processed. Several participants mentioned already being notified by their bank when the payment was pending. Some of the participants were interested in a notification if something changes about the payment amount or account.
- Phone calls are often not picked up and some participants are unsure if phone calls they receive about medical exam scheduling are legitimate.
- All participants found the sample confirmation email to be valuable and something they would be interested in receiving after submitting a claim. Some would have preferred more information to be included in the email such as the disabilities listed in the claim.
- Several participants mentioned wanting to go paperless or cited environmental concerns about receiving paper mail.
- Several participants mentioned wanting to be able to download letters from va.gov to save for their records in lieu of receiving paper copies.


## Recommendations
- Email notifications should be considered for all communication with Veterans throughout the disability compensation process in addition to existing written communication.
- Text message notifications may enhance certain aspects of the application experience and should be considered for point-in-time communications and updates.
- Veterans should have the ability to share their communication preferences for receiving notifications and these preferences should be respected by individual applications.
- Create guidelines for when opt-in vs opt-out approach to notifications is most appropriate. Not all participants found all notification types valuable. For example, none of our participants found monthly payment scheduled notifications valuable. In this case, an opt-in approach would only send these notifications to Veterans who found it useful while not creating extra noise for those who do not.
- Define what is an appropriate level of information to include in an email communication while respecting privacy.
- Define what makes a successful handoff between a notification and va.gov


## Future research opportunities
- Several notification types will direct users to perform an action on va.gov. Further research opportunities exist for following the Veteran experience after receiving a notification and transitioning to a task on va.gov.
- Consider the role of push notifications as an additional method of communication.
- Understand the percentage of Veterans with regular email and text message access.
