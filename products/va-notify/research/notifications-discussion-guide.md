# Notifications Research Discussion Guide
**7/2/2020**
## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Todd and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your experience applying for disability compensation benefits.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"**

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Let’s start with a few questions.
- Have you ever applied for disability compensation? If so, did you apply online using va.gov?
- How do you keep track of information you receive from VA about the benefits you apply for?
- Think about a time you’ve shopped online or created an account on a website and received an email or text message notification. How did you feel about this experience? (Ex: online shopping, shipping notifications, creating accounts)
- I'd like you to think about your experience applying for disability compensation benefits, any frustrations? Anything you liked?

## Transition to Tasks
 I am going to share my screen and you will see the steps you went through while applying for the disability compensation benefit. We'll walk through it together, talk about your experience, and what information is important to you at each step. We will also be talking about notifications during the process. We'll consider notifications to be any email, text message, or paper letter you receive from the VA with information about your disability compensation claim.

## First Task: Walk through user journey - 10 minutes
- We will walk through stages of applying for and receiving disability compensation benefits together.
- As we walk through, let me know any difficulties, frustrations, or things you liked in the process.
- Keep in mind email, text message, and paper letter notifications as we walk through. If there is a point in the process where you would have liked to receive an email, text message, or paper letter let me know.
[walk through user journey and pause at each major section to allow for discussion]

### Things to watch for:
- Are any of the pain points that could be addressed with notifications?
- At what points does the participant want to receive notifications?
- How does the participant view email vs text vs paper letter notifications?
- What information does the participant care about? Why is that information important?

## Second Task: Notifications information - 10 minutes
Thank you for identifying the areas where you would want to receive an email, text message, or paper letter. I'd like to discuss the type of information you would expect in each of those notifications.  
For each notification identified:
- What information would you expect to be in the email, text, or letter?
- Why do you want that information?
- What would you do with that information?
- How do you receive and this information today?

### Things to watch for:
- Are there specific pieces of information the participant values?
- Does the participant use the information they receive for anything?
- What determines the type of notification? Ex: the content, type of step, personal preference?
- How does the participant obtain the information now? (ex: call, print, screenshot, sign in to va.gov)

## Third Task: View email notification - 5 minutes
- Here is an example of an email notification with a confirmation of a claim being submitted.
- What do you think about the content of this email?
- Does this email look like something you would receive from VA?

### Things to watch for:
- Does the participant see value in this notification?
- Does the email seem like a trusted communication?


## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- What are your overall thoughts on receiving emails, text messages, and paper letters from VA?
- If you received the notifications we discussed above when you submitted your claim, how would your experience changed?

## Thank You and Closing

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research sesson?
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
