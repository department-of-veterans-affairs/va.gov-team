# Research Plan for VANotify Opt Out
**12/06/2021**

This document outlines a research plan for understanding how best to help Veterans opt out from VANotify emails and text messages.

## Background

The VA Notify Self Service Portal is the centralized home for managing email and SMS notifications at the VA. It requires authorization to log in and is an internal product. Veterans will be familiar with the notifications that are sent via this portal.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following OCTO objectives:
- Logged-in users can update their personal information easily and instantly
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
- Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov
- Increase completion rates of online transactions
- Decrease the time to successfully complete and submit online transactions
- Increase usage of digital, self-service tools

### Veteran Journey

Since Veterans need to receive notifications from the VA across the Veteran journey from applying to disability benefits through to burial benefits, this research is relevant to any stage of the Veteran journey from Starting up through to Aging and Dying.

## Research Goals:
- Understand how to handle opt outs in a way that reflects the intent of the Veteran
- Determine how to create a clear and intuitive opt out experience
- Understand why Veterans mark a VA email as spam
- Understand how users feel about using preferences to opt in and out of notifications

### Outcome
- Minimize email spam rates
- Capture and record opt outs and notification preferences for VANotify
- Achieve TCPA compliance

### General Research questions
- What are the reasons that Veterans unsubscribe from the different types of notifications?

### Research question for SMS Messages
- What are Veterans expectations as to what happens when they reply STOP?
- How would a Veteran reply when they want to stop receiving all VANotify & VEText (appointment reminder) messages?
- How would a Veteran reply when they want to stop receiving messages from a service?

### Research questions for email messages
- Do Veterans understand how to unsubscribe from emails?
- What are the reasons Veterans choose to mark a message as spam? Are they intentional or accidental? 
- Do Veterans understand what happens when they mark a message as spam? 
- Do Veterans want a preference to be able to be taken off the account suppression list? What method would they prefer (bottom of emails, call center, notification preferences center pop up)?
- Which method to unsubscribe is preferred?
- How do Veterans feel about using the notification preferences link in the email header/footer? Which would they choose between unsubscribe and management preferences and in what use cases?

### Hypothesis
- Veterans mark emails as spam because they do not currently have an option to unsubscribe 
- Veterans may not be clear on the extent of what marking an email as spam does (puts you on an email suppression list)
- Veterans have suggestions for improving the opt out experience based on challenges with current opt out experiences
- When given the option to opt out of a specific service line rather than all notifications, veterans will be more likely to choose to opt out of a specific service line rather than all VA notifications

## Method
- We will conduct semi-structured interviews to understand more generally the experience of Veterans with the unsubscribe process
- We will also do usability testing of the unsubscribe process showing wireframes and text messaging flows

### Location
We will conduct remote testing over Zoom video conferencing

## Participants and Recruitment
We are seeking 10 participants and will work with Perigean to recruit participants.
