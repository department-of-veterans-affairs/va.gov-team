# Research Plan for VA Notify Recipient Feedback 


## Background


**Problem:**
We don’t know how much information Veterans want in their emails. We are trying to discover how much information Veterans want in their emails. We are also trying to discover if the level of information they want in their emails depends on the type of email they are receiving.

Our ultimate goal is to develop a set of best practices for email communication for our VA Notify users.



## OCTO Priorities 

Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.



1. Improve the Veteran login experience
2. Solidify the VA.gov platform
3. Integrate health portal features into VA.gov
4. Expand the flagship mobile app
5. Refresh VA.gov homepage and IA
6. **Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience**
7. Fast-track disability claims, starting with PACT Act claims
8. Grow the OCTO team
9. Formalize the VA Innovation Unit and innovation process
10. Drive OIT’s Digital Transformation Strategy


## Veteran Journey

Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
* Getting Out 
* Starting Up
* Taking care of myself
* Reinventing myself
* Putting down roots
* Retiring
* Aging
* Dying


**Are there moments that matter?**



* Every one of our email communications matter as a touchpoint (appointments, benefits decisions, debt notices, etc.)


## Research Goals	

What are you trying to learn from this research? 



* The level of detail the recipient wants/expects to receive in email touchpoints
* Does level of detail vary by notification type?

*Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.* 


## Outcome

How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?



* We will be able to provide our users with best practices for writing email content for Veterans and their beneficiaries. This will:
    * Increase recipient satisfaction 
    * Increase ease of email creation
    * Consistency in approach to creating email notifications across content types and services


## Research questions

Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:



* How much information do Veterans want in their emails?
* Does the amount of information they want vary by email type? (confirmation, benefits, etc.) 



## Hypothesis

Our hypothesis is that Veterans want more information in their emails instead of requiring them to login in order to get the information.


What do you think users will do or think about these emails? (Identifying assumptions/bias)



* Veterans are grateful to be receiving email communications from the VA as this is relatively new
* Veterans have a certain expectation on the value the email content should provide based on their past experiences with other email communications of a similar nature
* It’s easier to get information up front in an email than logging in and possibly having to hunt for it.
* Veterans don’t like vague emails such as:  

_Dear Veteran,_
_You have information available from the Debt Management Center. Please sign in to _
_https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/ to view details._ 


* Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study.
    * We think that Veterans will want different amounts of information in different types of communications but that on balance they will want more information than they are currently receiving via email.  


## Methodology	

Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design. 
 



1. Our methodology will be a remote moderated interview of Veterans where we will  
Set up mock scenarios (eg. Imagine you’ve just applied for benefits and you receive the following notice.) and ask the Veteran what type of information they would expect to receive from the VA. 
2. After discussing what they would expect, we will show them an example of an existing VA and ask them to share their thoughts on the level of detail in the notification. 



## Location

Remote, Zoom


## Research materials

_Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request. _[conversation guide template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md)

Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.  

**Moderated interviews:**

* [Prototype Link](https://www.sketch.com/s/8be146b8-824f-4306-af16-f89c06026cfe/p/FE120B18-0E78-4549-B2A0-72383955313F/canvas)
	


## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 



* [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
* [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.


## Recruitment approach

Our intended audience for this research is Veterans, caregivers, and beneficiaries using Perigean.


## Recruitment criteria

List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**



* 10 Veterans / 3 Caregivers 
* Must currently receive emails.

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**

What criteria would strengthen your results? 



* As wide a distribution as possible of type of Veteran, Age, Gender, and Level of Ability.
* Veterans that are going (or have gone) through one (or more) of the following scenarios:
    * Applied for disability benefits
    * Applied for educational benefits
    * Owe a debt to the VA (overpayment of benefits or copay)
    * Updated their dependents
    * Burial Benefits


## Timeline

Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 


## Prepare

When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 



* Pilot participant email: 
* Date and time of pilot session: 


## Research sessions



* Planned dates of research: (we will add these once we have sign off from Bev and Platform)


## Length of sessions



* Session length:
    * 45 minutes
* Buffer time between sessions:
    * 30 minutes 
* Maximum Sessions per day: 
    * 3-4


## Availability

When would you like sessions scheduled? 



* 11am - 1pm ET Monday - Friday, Oct 23-27
* 5 - 6pm ET Tuesdays and Wednesdays Oct 24 & 25
* 2 time slots per day (up to 3 slots Tues & Wed)

Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.

**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work.** Spread observers across sessions so that there are no more than 5-6 total attendees (moderator, notetaker(s), observer(s)) per session on the VA side
