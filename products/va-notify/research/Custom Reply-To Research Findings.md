**We conducted 1-30 minute usability session with a clickable prototype of the “Custom Reply-To” feature with  Zoom screen sharing. We gave the participant a set of tasks to complete while thinking aloud. We also performed hallway testing with peers.**

**Some scenarios were:**
-   **If you were trying to create an email notification, how would you do that**
-   **Looking at this screen, what are the options available to you?**

**Based on the sessions conducted, we discovered some additional edits that needed to be made to the reply-to feature design to make it more clear to the end user.**

**FEEDBACK**
-   Visually group the no-reply with the checkbox, a quick note that says if you already have a custom reply-to address, enter it here. 
-   Update the more information dropdown to reflect the correct turnaround time for getting a custom address
