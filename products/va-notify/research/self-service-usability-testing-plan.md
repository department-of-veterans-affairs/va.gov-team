# VA Notify Self Service Usability Testing Round 1

## Purpose
The purpose of this study is to test the usability of the self service interface with users and gather feedback. During this study, our goal is to answer the following questions.
- Are participants able to successfully navigate the interface and perform the requested tasks?
- Are the necessary features available at the right time?
- Are participants comfortable using this interface to self service their notification needs?
- Do participants feel more confident about their notifications?

## Method
Participants will be given a series of tasks to complete using a clickable prototype. The sessions will be remotely moderated over Zoom. Each session will have one participant and run 30 minutes.

## Participants
Internal VA team members who have worked with VA Notify are our target participants. Our goal is five participants from a variety of disciplines.

## Discussion Guide
Thank you for joining today. We’re excited to hear your feedback. I will share a prototype link with you and ask you to share your screen and talk aloud as we walk through a few scenarios. Keep in mind that this is a prototype and not everything will behave as you expect. Please remember to speak out loud about what you are seeing and thinking as you interact with the prototype.

**Do you mind if I record this session for my note taking?**
