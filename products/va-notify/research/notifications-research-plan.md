# Research Plan for Disability Compensation Notifications
**7/2/2020**

This document outlines a research plan for notifications used throughout Veteran's journey while applying, waiting, and receiving disability compensation benefits.
## Goals
The notifications service (VANotify) enables emails and text messages to be sent to users with relevant information as they interact with VA. This research will focus on the disability compensation benefit including applying, waiting, receiving a decision, and receiving payment to understand what information Veterans value and how they would like to receive that information. Findings from this research will also be used to inform general notification experience guidelines to assist future teams in creating Veteran facing notifications. Specific goals include:
- Understand what information Veterans expect and value in a notification
- Determine when email vs text message notifications are most appropriate
- Understand when Veteran expect to receive notifications

## Method
We will conduct remote testing over zoom using a user journey map in Mural to aid the conversation.

## Participants and Recruitment
We are seeking 8 participants and will work with Perigean to recruit participants.  
Criteria:
- Have applied for disability compensation (form 526EZ) on va.gov (not via paper application)
