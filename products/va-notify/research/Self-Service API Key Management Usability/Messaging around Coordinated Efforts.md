Messaging for Platform and Strike team to share with services regarding change management with API Keys for our coordinated efforts:

---

**Hey [service name] team!**

Just a quick heads-up: VA Notify has two things going on right now related to API keys.

**Platform Team -** reaching out to services to rotate your API keys for security. Once you get your new key, you’ll have 30 days to replace the old one.

**UX Team -** working on making API key management self-service in the portal. We’ll be doing usability research and might reach out to some of you to help test the new features.

So if you hear from either team, it’s all part of the same effort to improve security and make things easier for you. Just wanted to make sure you all know these two efforts are connected.

Let us know if you have any questions!
