# Research Plan

## Research Goals
- Evaluate the usability of the new self-service API key management flow.
- Identify any points of confusion or friction in the three-step key generation process.
- Validate whether the "one thing per page" pattern supports clear decision-making.
- Understand users’ mental models around key naming, environment selection, and revocation.

## Research Questions
- Do users understand the purpose of API keys and the implications of managing them?
- Can users confidently complete the steps to generate a key?
- Does the environment suffix behavior in the key naming step make sense to users?
- Do users understand that they will only see the full API key once, and that it won’t be accessible again after they leave the page?
- Do users understand what happens after a key is generated, and how to manage inactive keys?
- Is the interface accessible and aligned with user expectations for security-sensitive workflows?

## Participants
3 - 5 service team members who currently use or are responsible for API integrations (mix of technical and non-technical roles)

### Ideally include:

- One technical contact (or engineer)
- One business contact
- One user who rotates API keys infrequently

## Methodology

- Remote moderated usability testing
- 30-minute sessions via Zoom
- Participants will interact with a clickable Figma prototype
- Researcher will ask open-ended questions and prompt task completion
- Sessions will be recorded (with consent) for analysis


## Prototype Tasks

### Generate an API Key

- Step 1: Select an environment
- Step 2: Name the key (suffix behavior will be observed)
- Step 3: Review choices and confirm generation

### Interpret inactive key display
- Observe if users understand why only one inactive key per environment is shown

### Revoke an active key
- Identify if the user feels confident revoking a key and understands what happens after

## Success Indicators
- Users complete the flow without backtracking or asking for clarification
- Users describe the suffix naming behavior as helpful or intuitive
- Participants correctly explain the system’s behavior regarding inactive keys
- No major accessibility or comprehension issues are observed
