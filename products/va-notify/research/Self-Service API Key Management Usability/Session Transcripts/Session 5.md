Session 5

**Facilitator**   2:07
Good. Thank you so much for making time to meet with me today.
I know calendars can get a little hairy so.
 
**Participant**   2:11
Oh no problem.
That's fine.
And I didn't know 'cause I know there's another meeting scheduled.
Oh, when is it scheduled?
Is it? Yeah, Monday.
VA notify what is it?
Because they had. You had contacted me and Kesenia had contacted Casa Kashaf, also VA notify API key handoff.
Are these two different things or?
 
**Facilitator**   2:44
You know what?
You beat me to it.
I was gonna. I wasn't sure.
With the timing of their roll out and ours, so we I'm on the experience side and they're on the platform side of VA notify.
But.
They're we're still like the same team.
So we're we have two things going on right now that are API key related, but they're all part of the efforts are connected.
 
**Participant**   3:06
OK.
 
**Facilitator**   3:12
While we're trying to like make you know, our security improvements.
And like, make things easier for the keys to be managed by the teams themselves.
So on the UX side, on the experience team we're working on making API key management self-service and a feature that's going to be available to you guys in the in the VA notified of Portal and the platform team is reaching out to teams to get their key their.
 
**Participant**   3:35
Mm-hmm.
 
**Facilitator**   3:39
Current key is rotated and updated for security purposes.
So I I.
 
**Participant**   3:43
Kind of what I thought.
I I understand.
I went through the with.
The the training.
They had a UX designer training and somebody saying Oh no, no, we have a meeting Monday.
You you don't need that meeting.
You don't need that.
I'm like, wait a minute though, this may be something completely different.
So just I was telling just kind of calm down a little.
Let me talk to them and see what's going on.
So that's kind of what I thought it may be something a little different.
 
**Facilitator**   4:07
Yes.
Thank you so much for that and I'm sorry for anything was unclear.
 
**Participant**   4:16
No, no problem.
 
**Facilitator**   4:18
Yeah, I we're like moving.
You know fast and so.
 
**Participant**   4:23
Mm-h.
 
**Facilitator**   4:26
Well, I know we have just a short amount of time, so I I wanna kinda jump into it.
But I also have one of my colleagues on the line just observing and taking notes.
 
**Participant**   4:39
OK.
 
**Facilitator**   4:40
But just a quick reminder.
But you know, I'm not testing you.
I'm testing the design, so if something is confusing or it doesn't work the way you would think it would, it's actually really helpful for me to hear so your honest feedback, positive or negative super important.
 
**Participant**   4:52
No problem.
 
**Facilitator**   4:57
Do you have any questions for me before we dive in?
 
**Participant**   5:00
No, not yet.
I haven't even had a chance to look at the portal yet.
So no idea.
 
**Facilitator**   5:06
Oh, OK, so so you've not logged into portal yet.
 
**Participant**   5:09
No. I was gonna look for to see where to find the login, and I hadn't even found it yet.
It's just we had the Edis outage and well, a bunch of application outage yesterday and it kind of snowballed.
So it kind of took up most of my day yesterday.
 
**Facilitator**   5:25
Yeah.
Sounds completely understandable.
So yeah, well.
That actually answers my first question was how familiar you are with working in the portal, but what about with just API keys in general and managing them at the VA?
 
**Participant**   5:47
Generally I don't have to do too much managing of them.
I my role is well, it's odd.
I end up doing more than what my job description really is, but.
I'm a systems analyst, but I also function a lot as the Tier 2 end user help, so I kind of flow between.
Helping not only the users but I help.
Go between the vendor or IMED consent and the tech team and the the business owner and stuff like that too.
So I do.
I dabble a little bit of everything.
Which is why I get pulled into a lot of these.
 
**Facilitator**   6:32
OK.
 
**Participant**   6:34
So I'm kind of more of a back up on some of this when the vendor doesn't know what to do with the keys or the certificates or stuff like that.
 
**Facilitator**   6:43
Yeah. OK.
No, that's great.
Well, I think that you're the right person for this meeting, for sure.
 
**Participant**   6:49
OK.
 
**Facilitator**   6:50
So let's say, you know, I know that you have the meeting coming up on Monday.
 
**Participant**   6:57
Mm-hmm.
 
**Facilitator**   6:58
To get the keys updated and rotated.
But eventually that's gonna be something that we're gonna expect all of our services to do in portal.
On their own, where would you think to go to look for help to get your keys rotated?
 
**Participant**   7:21
Well, my first question is gonna be, is it in the Cyber Ark area?
Because I'm I'm assuming with the keys it's more of a secured issue.
It's not something that's open to everyone.
Am I correct?
 
**Facilitator**   7:37
Yes.
 
**Participant**   7:38
OK.
 
**Facilitator**   7:39
So I don't know what Cyber Ark is, but I do know it's gonna be the portal is something you have to access within the network.
 
**Participant**   7:42
Add.
Mm-h.
 
**Facilitator**   7:50
And only certain roles will have the permissions to do it within the portal.
 
**Participant**   7:54
OK, so like my let's see.
There is many different ways that people terminology that people use the non male enabled account, zero account admin.
Account along those lines.
 
**Facilitator**   8:11
Yes.
 
**Participant**   8:11
Because there's only a few of us on our team that have that. So that's why I'm lumped in as well because I have that access.
 
**Facilitator**   8:20
Yeah. So I believe the reason you are on my list is because you're assigned as a Business Contact for this for your service and so.
 
**Participant**   8:31
OK.
 
**Facilitator**   8:33
The the Business Contact has the highest level of permissions on a service.
 
**Participant**   8:39
OK.
 
**Facilitator**   8:39
Above that is platform admin and that would be stuff that you know the VA notify internal team would have access to to like onboard new services. And you know just general.
Management of the the portal itself. So.
Only so there's viewer editor.
Technical contact and Business Contact and with Business Contact having the most and viewer having the bare minimum. Obviously just read only access so.
The user roles that we'll be able to manage and rotate API keys will be the Business Contact.
And the technical contact.
 
**Participant**   9:22
OK.
 
**Facilitator**   9:23
And I don't believe you have any technical contacts assigned for your service right now.
But if down, you might want to try to think here.
 
**Participant**   9:35
With the technical context be our vendors since they are the ones that we're similar to a cops product.
 
**Facilitator**   9:40
Oh.
You know what, Jackie? I apologize.
You and Kashif are technical contacts, not business contacts.
 
**Participant**   9:49
OK.
 
**Facilitator**   9:51
So it looks like Christopher.
 
**Participant**   9:55
Christopher Vanannen is the one of the business owners.
 
**Facilitator**   9:55
Vonahan one moment.
So he is listed as the Business Contact.
 
**Participant**   10:01
And OK.
 
**Facilitator**   10:03
Mm-hmm. So so, yes. You are actually assigned as one of, like, the users who will be doing this.
So this is great.
 
**Participant**   10:11
OK.
 
**Facilitator**   10:13
We'll get your your feet wet.
 
**Participant**   10:15
Sounds good.
 
**Facilitator**   10:18
What kind of help or resources would you want available when it's time to rotate the keys?
 
**Participant**   10:24
Basically just directions.
I usually pretty self-sufficient as far as.
Knowing where to go and you know a basic set of instructions of how to do it I.
I know with the work you guys do in general as far as most most things, there is usually either a SharePoint site or a SharePoint page or something along those lines with detailed instructions.
I usually hit the snow knowledge articles towards the end, even though I'm the SME for writing some of this knowledge articles.
But they're not always the easiest to find.
Or navigate, but a lot of times the the training there is usually training videos or training articles.
On a SharePoint page, so I'll look for that. But.
 
**Facilitator**   11:11
OK. Do you?
Would you find a step by step instruction or a video or quick summary more useful for you?
 
**Participant**   11:22
For me, just like a step by step, you know, do this, do this, do this, do this, do. This would be my best. But that's how I learned some people are videos. Some people I just you know give me the quick down and dirty instructions and I'll I.
 
**Facilitator**   11:27
Yeah.
 
**Participant**   11:36
Usually get it. If not, you know if there's a person to reach out to.
 
**Facilitator**   11:39
Got it.
 
**Participant**   11:41
If I get stumped with something, that's great, but.
 
**Facilitator**   11:44
OK.
 
**Participant**   11:45
Usually it's not too bad.
 
**Facilitator**   11:45
Yeah. No, that's great.
So let's say that your keys are.
You have a key that's about to expire, and it needs to be rotated.
 
**Participant**   11:54
Mm-hmm.
 
**Facilitator**   11:56
What way would you expect to be made aware that this needed to happen?
 
**Participant**   12:01
I would assume we'd probably get the those of us who can update them would get an e-mail. That's how most things are done.
 
**Facilitator**   12:07
OK.
OK.
Well, let's say that you receive an e-mail that one of your keys is about to expire and you need to rotate it.
And that means that you'll need to create a new key, update your integration, and then disable the old key.
I'm gonna share my screen.
 
**Participant**   12:25
OK.
 
**Facilitator**   12:26
And.
I have yet to figure out how to give remote access to let users click through, so you'll have to just kind of walk me through your your mental model on this.
 
**Participant**   12:34
That's OK.
 
**Facilitator**   12:40
Like what?
What you're seeing and your thoughts and stuff so.
This is part. This is what the portal looks like.
The VA notify portal and when you log in your username will be up here.
 
**Participant**   12:51
OK.
Mm-hmm.
 
**Facilitator**   12:58
And if you're assigned to more than one service, you when you first log in, you'll have to choose which service you want to work in.
But if you only have one, it automatically puts you into the workspace for that service, and that workspace is where all of your templates are.
From there you can view the dashboard. I'm just walking you through this briefly, since you've not been in here before.
 
**Participant**   13:21
Not a problem.
 
**Facilitator**   13:23
You can view the dashboard which has some performance metrics and see like how.
Your templates are doing. See if anything's failing. If the numbers look right, just kind of keep a pulse on things in the user hub, you can see a list of all users assigned to your service along with their role on the service. There's also.
A list of roles and permissions, along with the descriptions, and like what those permissions are, are available to each of those those roles there.
And then in settings this is settings specifically just for the service you're in.
There's details and in details it shows you.
Your production and your staging ID's it shows any custom reply to inboxes that you have set up if you have.
A testing list. You can go that to that.
Here you can manage your reply to inboxes here.
And so this is the page that you land on when you get when you click on settings. So from here, where would you go?
To rotate and get the new API key generated.
 
**Participant**   14:43
I would say it would be the API key management would make the most sense.
 
**Facilitator**   14:47
OK.
Yep. And when I click on that what what would you expect to have happen or see there?
 
**Participant**   14:57
Most likely I would.
I guess I would see what keys we have in and expiration dates and.
If the portal gives you the option to create new keys, there would be that option there as well.
 
**Facilitator**   15:11
OK.
 
**Participant**   15:12
But not having used it, I'm not sure what's there.
 
**Facilitator**   15:15
Bear, that's totally fair.
Since I'm kind of controlling the scroll and everything, if you want me to scroll or do anything or click on anything, let me know.
 
**Participant**   15:27
OK.
No, that's looks OK.
So yeah, you've got a link, right?
How to get to instructions I would assume to see how to manage and then the generate API key and then I'm seeing active and expiring, so I would assume that's the list of the keys down below so that looks.
And I mean it looks fairly.
Easy. Do you do you just click on revoke then to remove it?
And.
Is that a button?
 
**Facilitator**   16:06
Would would that be?
Would that be your first step?
 
**Participant**   16:10
Well, as far as I would generate one first get a new one in and then revoke it.
 
**Facilitator**   16:14
OK.
 
**Participant**   16:15
But I didn't know if the the word revoke is a button is looks like there's a little waste can next to it but.
 
**Facilitator**   16:16
OK.
 
**Participant**   16:23
I guess I would just generate a new one and get that one in and then revoke the old one.
 
**Facilitator**   16:28
OK.
 
**Participant**   16:29
But the question I have what is now?
 
**Facilitator**   16:30
So.
When?
 
**Participant**   16:32
Does this affect anything since we've got I see staging in production, so I'm assuming pre prod, pre production and production.
Does this affect anything in the current workflow?
So would this need to be done after hours and that kind of thing?
'Cause, I know when we change out certificates we usually do it after hours because it would affect patient care if you know if there's a downtime and stuff like that.
 
**Facilitator**   17:02
So how would you try and figure out that information?
 
**Participant**   17:09
That's usually through the vendor and we just assist the vendor 'cause. They're the ones doing that.
 
**Facilitator**   17:14
OK.
So the honest answer is I do not know.
 
**Participant**   17:21
OK.
 
**Facilitator**   17:22
But I think that that is something that we can include in our our help DOC here.
 
**Participant**   17:29
OK.
 
**Facilitator**   17:31
So.
In here it takes you to the technical information in in the actual design it would deep link into the the spot where you needed to go. But.
But it's a prototype, so I don't have it that fancy.
But it would take you to the API keys in VA notify and and down to how to manage them.
So.
I think that we could probably include what you're asking.
If if it is a holistic answer, like if it like applies to all services.
You know in this section.
 
**Participant**   18:17
Mm-hmm. No, my concern would be, does it affect the application as far as cause any downtime?
 
**Facilitator**   18:19
Or possibly down here.
Yeah, right. Right.
I think that that is what's involved with.
Updating the system.
 
**Participant**   18:33
Mm-hmm.
 
**Facilitator**   18:34
So so testing like changing out all of the keys, testing it, and then before you revoke the old one, you make sure that everything is is working correct.
 
**Participant**   18:47
OK.
Now I remember reading reading through these instructions.
It was a while ago and it's.
'Cause looking at this, I'm like, OK.
I've read this but I had forgotten all about it.
Sorry about that.
And I knew the name Virginia notify, but I I hadn't remembered where I'd seen it, but.
 
**Facilitator**   18:59
No.
 
**Participant**   19:06
We go through so many things and but now I'm looking at these.
I'm like, wait a minute. I've read these instructions before or something similar, I don't know.
Maybe it was a kind of a work in progress when you know a memo went out or something.
 
**Facilitator**   19:19
OK.
Yeah, I was gonna say this is new.
So maybe that that's good that it seems familiar, though, that it's not, you know.
 
**Participant**   19:28
Or it could have been something else that had similar type instructions that one of your teams had worked on and kind of follow the same format, I don't know.
 
**Facilitator**   19:36
Yeah.
 
**Participant**   19:36
I just because I was seeing the like Cicd pipelines and you know doing to the update the system so.
 
**Facilitator**   19:44
Nice. OK.
 
**Participant**   19:44
Now I'm going to have to go through my deleted e-mail and see what I found.
See what I can find but.
 
**Facilitator**   19:50
That's it.
So all right, well, we will.
I will find out for sure about the downtime and get that included. If that's and I'll let you know what I find out as well.
 
**Participant**   19:56
OK.
 
**Facilitator**   20:03
So let's say that you we found what we needed to find out here.
And.
Where what would be your next step to get the key generated?
 
**Participant**   20:14
Well, I mean to me it would be generate API keep clicking on the box there it that kind of seems like the you know you guys have it fairly simply laid out.
 
**Facilitator**   20:29
So when we click on that, what do you expect to see?
 
**Participant**   20:36
Either like a listing of, you know, all of the information.
Similar to what you have on the screen there, which the you know the name the.
Whether it's production, staging like kind of a checklist type of thing, or something similar to that.
 
**Facilitator**   20:54
OK.
Let's go ahead and click on it.
 
**Participant**   21:00
OK.
Yeah, it's even pared down less than to a lot simpler than I thought it would be.
 
**Facilitator**   21:07
Nice. OK, good.
So what would you do from here?
 
**Participant**   21:15
And then if I'm working in production or staging which is staging.
Or are like our testing environment, our test environment, our preproduction environment?
Is that the same environment or what is your definition of staging?
 
**Facilitator**   21:35
Right now, yes, staging is like the test environment or like the environment where like you have your draft and you're getting everything ready to go.
Production is is where they're sending real messages.
 
**Participant**   21:44
OK.
OK.
 
**Facilitator**   21:49
And when you log into VA notify, it's all in one environment, so you don't have to copy and paste or go to another link to see things.
We've kind of merged everything to happen in one area.
So you would manage your staging and production all in this experience.
 
**Participant**   22:12
Oh, OK.
So yeah, I mean.
Yeah, I guess if it's.
If pre production and production are in the same thing then you would just choose what you're going for and then continue.
 
**Facilitator**   22:31
OK.
So let's let's update the staging key. Continue.
 
**Participant**   22:43
Whatever the typical naming convention is for the key, which I guess I should have, I would have copied it into a notepad prior, but you know.
It's not me doing it, but.
 
**Facilitator**   22:59
So I I did just make up a name for the prototype, but I'm curious if you noticed that the environment that we chose is added as a suffix.
 
**Participant**   23:08
Mm-hmm.
 
**Facilitator**   23:12
Do you happen to know if this would conflict with any internal naming conventions that that your service has?
Or if this is helpful or confusing.
 
**Participant**   23:25
I think the staging is gonna confuse people because we're not used to seeing the word staging. We're used to seeing like pre prod reproduction.
 
**Facilitator**   23:36
OK.
 
**Participant**   23:36
That's the only that's the only difference here.
That's question.
I'm like, OK.
So what is staging is.
It is it, our test environment or is it something specific to VA notify?
 
**Facilitator**   23:47
I see.
So it is specific to VA notify.
 
**Participant**   23:52
OK.
 
**Facilitator**   23:53
Mm-hmm.
 
**Participant**   23:54
Because we have two different environments, we have our production, which is what everyday users use with real patients. Our test our pre prod is where we can go in and we can try our releases, our patches, different things like that before putting them into production to make sure.
We don't have any bugs to work out those things, so it's it's environment that is.
Almost identical.
Sometimes it's not quite identical.
But the patients aren't real.
It's not data that's going out to anyone other than those who have access to that testing environment.
 
**Facilitator**   24:33
OK.
 
**Participant**   24:33
So that's the only thing that may confuse people is they're, like, 'cause. They're gonna see staging, and they're gonna think, OK, what is the staging for is that?
Is that for our test environment our pre prod?
 
**Facilitator**   24:45
OK.
Yeah, that's totally fair.
I I do wonder if.
Some of it is.
Something you would see consistently throughout the portal we we do reference staging in production often.
And it's paired along with your templates. So I wonder if it would just be like something that you'd become familiar with after using it, or if it would be something that would be like, you know.
 
**Participant**   25:10
OK.
 
**Facilitator**   25:22
Continuously confusing and I think.
 
**Participant**   25:24
I think you'd probably become used to it 'cause now do you stage the key first before going into production or do you always have two different sets?
 
**Facilitator**   25:35
You guys have two different sets.
 
**Participant**   25:36
OK.
 
**Facilitator**   25:42
All right. So let's say that we named it.
And we're going to hit continue.
What would you do from here?
 
**Participant**   25:54
I would start with the drop down and fill everything out that I needed to.
So the environment, the name.
If I needed to edit anything in the environment, I would hit edit and I guess the first time I'm doing it I would hit edit and go in and see what's in there. If I needed to change anything.
Oh, OK.
So because I didn't know what you had in those, that wouldn't need to be changed.
 
**Facilitator**   26:22
OK.
 
**Participant**   26:23
But not knowing what was in there, it's like, OK, those are fine.
 
**Facilitator**   26:25
Yeah.
OK.
And then continue from here, OK.
 
**Participant**   26:30
But then yeah, continue.
And then what is the purpose of tapping to the clipboard? Is there?
A security risk that it could be lost. Or is there?
Do you need that key number later?
Is that why you copy it to the clip clipboard?
 
**Facilitator**   26:58
This is like for API keys.
 
**Participant**   27:01
Mm-hmm.
 
**Facilitator**   27:03
And I don't if you already know this. I don't want to like over explain it, but.
It's my understanding that you only get to see it one time because it's such a secure thing. It does have the name associated with it, and there's like an ID number, but it's not the actual API key, so you only have this one opportunity to copy it and.
 
**Participant**   27:13
OK.
 
**Facilitator**   27:28
And then put it somewhere safe so.
Like it says to treat it like a path board.
 
**Participant**   27:35
No, that's that's fine.
Yeah. I just wanted to make sure.
OK.
So yeah, there would be a reason to copy it then, and I hadn't read through the instructions yet that was.
 
**Facilitator**   27:52
You're OK. I think you know, some people are more familiar with the the process of generating and rotating API keys. And I think that that's and and some are less familiar.
I fall into the less familiar I've learned a lot.
 
**Participant**   28:05
Mm-hmm.
As do I.
 
**Facilitator**   28:10
So.
So yeah, I I think that's also like I said, really helpful to know because we do have a lot of different knowledge base.
Users coming in and.
So yeah, like.
That's I think very like helpful to know that that could be confusing if you didn't know that you'd only see it the one time.
 
**Participant**   28:35
Yeah.
 
**Facilitator**   28:38
Any ideas on what you might want to see that would make that more clear here?
 
**Participant**   28:45
I mean, you do say this is the only time you'll be able to view your full API key, but.
'Cause, that's the first thing.
And yeah, if I if I was actually doing this step by step, I would have read that. But I was just talking to the thing that pops up first is that blue copy to clipboard. When I look down, I'm like, oh, OK, copy it. Why am I cop?
 
**Facilitator**   29:05
OK.
 
**Participant**   29:12
This clipboard.
You know what?
What do I need to do?
And I saw that before I even saw the instructions.
 
**Facilitator**   29:21
Gotcha.
 
**Participant**   29:21
Maybe copy the clipboard?
This is the some you know, expanding on that of why you're copying clipboard, but that's just, that's just me in my non knowledge of the API keys.
 
**Facilitator**   29:33
Yeah, that's totally valid though.
Something that makes it just like a little bit like more obvious that this.
 
**Participant**   29:41
This is your last chance.
 
**Facilitator**   29:42
Is.
 
**Participant**   29:43
You know, you you don't do it now.
 
**Facilitator**   29:43
Yeah.
 
**Participant**   29:44
You're you're done.
 
**Facilitator**   29:46
Yeah. Yeah. OK. I like that.
All right. So from here, we're gonna copy it to clipboard.
And then where would you go from here?
 
**Participant**   30:05
Well, the little next thing go back to the API key management.
 
**Facilitator**   30:09
OK.
 
**Participant**   30:13
Yeah, I was gonna say it should be there. That now you have to the stage in one is active.
Then I would assume you could revoke the expiring 1.
After you test and make sure it's it's where it needs to be.
And or adding it to your.
 
**Facilitator**   30:28
OK.
 
**Participant**   30:30
Making sure it's in your in your system and stuff like that.
 
**Facilitator**   30:35
Yeah. So let's pretend that the new key has been in place and it's everything's been tested.
And now you're ready to revoke the old one.
How would you go about doing that?
 
**Participant**   30:48
Well, looking at it, I guess you would just click on the little garbage can and throw it away.
 
**Facilitator**   30:53
OK. And so it once I click on that, what do you expect to have happen?
 
**Participant**   30:59
Most likely there most programs there's. Are you sure you want to do this?
 
**Facilitator**   31:03
OK.
 
**Participant**   31:04
But I don't know if there's a message that pops up or not.
OK, that's even more secure than because you actually have to do something.
It's not just like, oh, OK.
You don't click just OK.
You have to.
Put some effort into it and is the revoke case sensitive?
OK.
 
**Facilitator**   31:40
Let's say that we are.
We're sure this is what we're gonna do.
So having gone through all the steps so far.
As far as generating and then you've tested it, would you feel confident in taking this step to revoke this key in production? OK.
 
**Participant**   31:55
Yeah, as long as everything was good.
Yeah, I'd have no problem with that.
 
**Facilitator**   31:59
All right.
 
**Participant**   32:05
And then I would assume that would go down below to the little inactive.
 
**Facilitator**   32:05
All right.
Yeah. Can you talk me through anything that might stand out to you in the inactive key section?
 
**Participant**   32:21
Do there before another.
Still too did it bump off an older one.
 
**Facilitator**   32:27
What would you expect to have happen?
 
**Participant**   32:30
Well, I thought there was two before and I would expect to see three, but there's still only two.
So does it just show show the last two?
 
**Facilitator**   32:38
So that's what our prototype is showing right now.
But I'd be interested in knowing if you would want more historical context there, or if that's enough.
 
**Participant**   32:51
That would be more of a developer question and maybe a kaashov could provide.
He's our, he's our architect.
He could provide more answers into that to me.
I mean, seeing the last two I think would be enough, but he would be a better resource to ask that.
 
**Facilitator**   33:11
I do not have time set up with him.
 
**Participant**   33:15
I think he's.
I think he was confused and Chris was probably saying, well, we only need one meeting altogether.
And.
 
**Facilitator**   33:22
OK, I see.
 
**Participant**   33:24
And that's why I'm like, no, I think it's two different things and.
Seeing that other meeting come up, I think he might have thought it was already taken care of.
 
**Facilitator**   33:35
I see.
 
**Participant**   33:35
I can try to shoot him a message and tell him it's a different.
Different kind of meeting.
 
**Facilitator**   33:40
It I I think it would be helpful to get his perspective as well, if if he's available. If not, I think that you know.
 
**Participant**   33:46
Mm-hmm.
 
**Facilitator**   33:53
We can probably.
 
**Participant**   33:56
What have you been hearing from a lot of the other people?
 
**Facilitator**   33:56
You know, manage.
 
**Participant**   33:58
Are they saying two is enough or they thinking they want more?
 
**Facilitator**   34:01
You know what?
That's kind of why I was curious.
I've I've had a couple folks say that two is enough.
But it seems like a lot of our more like technical folks.
 
**Participant**   34:15
They want more.
 
**Facilitator**   34:16
Want about two years worth?
 
**Participant**   34:20
That makes sense.
I mean it because it's well because.
My I have a lab background so having as much data possible as always.
My, you know, keeping keeping the data is always.
You know what I'd like? But I'm thinking, OK, with this my.
I had to quickly analyze. OK.
Do we really need it?
Are we ever going to go back to those?
Because once they're gone, you can't pull them back in.
So what are we ever going to need? You know, the other data for.
So that's where I was like, we really wouldn't and you know.
Trying to make that call on the fly. If it was my opinion, it would be just like, yeah, we wouldn't.
 
**Facilitator**   35:01
Yeah.
 
**Participant**   35:02
We can't go back to them, so I don't know, but.
Yeah, I don't.
 
**Facilitator**   35:09
Yeah.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.
 
**Participant**   35:15
No, I I was just.
I was just.
I like.
I don't see ever wanting to.
I don't know.
Yeah, I can see both sides of it. Really it's.
Having the information but.
What do they need to prove?
But I guess I'd have to talk to somebody who wants that. Two years is like, is there some?
Is there some handbook rule that you need to prove that you've changed them multiple times in the last two years?
You know where? Where are they getting this information?
 
**Facilitator**   35:43
Right.
Yeah, I'd be really curious about that as well.
 
**Participant**   35:51
And is it just or is it just?
The typical vehicle. I gotta. I gotta cover my **** type of situation and wanna have that documentation.
 
**Facilitator**   36:00
That's fair too. That's fair too.
 
**Participant**   36:02
I've been with the VA since 2005, so I understand that issue too.
 
**Facilitator**   36:06
OK.
I think that's also a really good point. I don't think anyone's mentioned that part yet, but I think that that's probably where it it's rooted in you know.
 
**Participant**   36:15
Yeah, that quite possibly.
 
**Facilitator**   36:16
So yeah.
I know that we're a little over time, so if you need to bounce, I totally understand.
But I I was just curious if if in general, aside from the the things that we have mentioned was anything unclear or confusing about the process.
 
**Participant**   36:36
No, it your portal looks very user-friendly I could.
Even I could even show actual end users how to use this.
Where I I've struggled with showing end users to how to use some different things and yours is really easy.
 
**Facilitator**   36:52
Oh, thank you. That's great to hear.
 
**Participant**   36:52
So I mean.
Believe me, my own application I have to struggle to show users how to use it, so I would I would love to revamp that one.
But that's a contract.
It's a vendor owned, so I don't have a lot of choice in that.
 
**Facilitator**   37:09
It is tough. Yeah. And making a case for it to be a priority and everything for sure.
 
**Participant**   37:10
Mm-hmm.
 
**Facilitator**   37:16
Let me get you the link to the.
 
**Participant**   37:16
Oh yeah.
 
**Facilitator**   37:19
To log in real quick.
 
**Participant**   37:20
Oh, OK, that would be wonderful.
 
**Facilitator**   37:20
So yeah, that way you don't have to.
Try and hunt it down.
 
**Participant**   37:26
Yeah. And then I'll just save it in with my favorites.
So at least have it 'cause. I know I was looking.
I quick popped up the emails and Wednesday I think it was we got one from who was it from?
Dave Conlin about making sure we log in every.
How many days?
 
**Facilitator**   37:42
Yes, every 90 days.
It's.
 
**Participant**   37:46
Yes.
 
**Facilitator**   37:48
I think that's also part of like just.
Amping up our security best practices and making sure that we're, you know, compliant with VA standards and basic standards for those kind of things, so.
 
**Participant**   37:54
Oh, definitely.
 
**Facilitator**   38:05
Yeah, you're going to be hearing from us a lot, I think.
 
**Participant**   38:08
No, that's fine.
And yeah, I've got calendar reminders to log into all kinds of different stuff so that it doesn't time out.
 
**Facilitator**   38:16
Same same.
 
**Participant**   38:17
Otherwise, yeah, I'd never remember.
 
**Facilitator**   38:19
No, no, for sure.
Especially not something that you're frequently visiting so.
Well, did you? Do you see the link in there?
 
**Participant**   38:29
Yep, and I'm logging in as. Oh wait, you are not authorized to access this page.
 
**Facilitator**   38:30
OK, perfect.
Oh.
 
**Participant**   38:38
Well.
 
**Facilitator**   38:40
Do you?
 
**Observer**   38:41
I can.
I can actually help out with that.
So there's a a certain provisioning step that needs to be taken and I can I can go ahead and get you added in then. Would you mind sharing your VA Gov e-mail?
 
**Participant**   38:53
OK.
No problem, I'll just type it in there so.
 
**Observer**   38:57
Perfect.
 
**Participant**   39:00
Since I was.
 
**Facilitator**   39:02
Does it help at all to know that I got Jackie's name from the portal and she was assigned as a technical contact?
 
**Observer**   39:14
OK.
So Jackie is in the portal already.
 
**Facilitator**   39:18
That's what it looks like to me.
 
**Observer**   39:20
So. So right now for the lower environments though, there is an additional provisioning step required with IAM. So it is possible that maybe.
 
**Facilitator**   39:26
OK.
 
**Participant**   39:29
OK.
 
**Observer**   39:32
Someone on the team added her e-mail but didn't do that additional step.
 
**Facilitator**   39:33
OK.
 
**Observer**   39:36
So I'll go ahead and take care of that for you.
 
**Participant**   39:37
So do I just need to go to identity management and request it or?
 
**Observer**   39:42
No, no, no.
 
**Facilitator**   39:42
I think.
 
**Observer**   39:43
There's nothing you need to do specifically.
 
**Participant**   39:45
OK.
 
**Observer**   39:47
We we take care of that on our end and then I will follow up with you once I've gone ahead and done that.
 
**Participant**   39:50
OK.
Wonderful. Thank you so much.
 
**Observer**   39:55
Of course.
 
**Facilitator**   39:56
It's relatively quick, isn't it, Sam?
 
**Observer**   39:58
Yeah, it shouldn't take.
I mean getting onto the network takes longer than the process so.
 
**Facilitator**   39:59
Yeah.
Spell on.
 
**Participant**   40:04
That's usually how it goes.
That's why I said I was trying to log in.
 
**Facilitator**   40:06
Yeah.
 
**Participant**   40:07
I was waiting for my PIV to be recognized, but.
 
**Observer**   40:12
Yeah, by 12:30 eastern. I'll have you add it in there.
 
**Facilitator**   40:13
OK.
 
**Participant**   40:17
No problem.
 
**Facilitator**   40:18
Perfect. Thanks Sam.
 
**Participant**   40:20
Tina.
 
**Observer**   40:21
Course.
 
**Facilitator**   40:22
And you know, Jackie, once you have access and you know, you poke around in there and stuff if you have any questions at all, just feel free to shoot us a message.
 
**Participant**   40:32
I will do that.
Would you like me to also give you kasha's e-mail address to make sure he's also properly provisioned?
 
**Facilitator**   40:40
Oh, that sounds like a great plan.
 
**Observer**   40:41
Absolutely.
Yeah, yeah.
 
**Participant**   40:44
Just because I know how things go and it would be a struggle because all of a sudden, hey, I don't have it.
 
**Facilitator**   40:45
I think.
Right. And like once you need to use it, you know?
 
**Participant**   40:52
Let me get his.
Mm-hmm.
 
**Facilitator**   40:57
Yeah.
 
**Participant**   40:58
OK.
Where is it? There's his e-mail.
 
**Observer**   41:08
Perfect.
 
**Facilitator**   41:09
Perfect.
 
**Participant**   41:13
Both were doing smash and thank you for the demo, it it helps to see it. And yeah, it's it looks like it's super easy to use so not a problem.
 
**Facilitator**   41:15
Hello.
Yeah.
Fantastic. No, but I I loved all the the little call outs about specific things that you know.
You'd want to know before taking these steps. Like for example, is there downtime and you know I some things to dig into for sure.
So I really appreciate your perspective.
 
**Participant**   41:39
OK.
Well, you're welcome and thank you for taking the time to show me and I'll drop cash if a message and let him know that it was.
 
**Facilitator**   41:42
All right.
 
**Participant**   41:49
It's a different meeting than the one we're gonna have Monday.
 
**Facilitator**   41:52
OK.
Yeah. And if he has time, I'd love to speak with him.
Like if not, I totally understand people are are busy and we appreciate, you know, anytime that we can get so.
 
**Participant**   42:02
OK.
Well, thank you both so much.
 
**Facilitator**   42:03
All right.
 
**Participant**   42:05
You guys have a great weekend.
 
**Facilitator**   42:07
Next, you too, Jackie. Thank you.
 
**Observer**   42:07
You too.
 
**Participant**   42:08
Thank you.
 
**Observer**   42:10
Bye.
 
**Participant**   42:10
Bye bye.
