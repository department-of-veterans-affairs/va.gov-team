**Subject:** Quick Feedback Session on VA Notify API Key Management

Hi [Name],

We’re working on improving how API Keys are managed in VA Notify and identified your service as one whose insights would be especially valuable. We’re exploring a self-service API key rotation experience and are looking for feedback from users who’ll be using this feature in the future.

Could you join a 30-minute virtual session to click through a prototype and share your thoughts?

Available times (30-minute sessions, starting on the hour or half-hour):
* Wednesday, July 9: 10:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m. ET
* Thursday, July 10: 1:30 – 2:30 p.m. ET
* Friday, July 11: 2:00 – 3:00 p.m. ET
* Tuesday, July 15: 1:30 – 3:30 p.m. ET
* Wednesday, July 16: 1:00 – 2:00 p.m. ET

Feel free to suggest other times that may work better for your schedule and we will see what we might accommodate. If there’s someone else on your team who might be interested in participating or a better fit to provide insights, please send me their contact information!

Thanks for helping us make VA Notify better!

Best,
