# VANotify Notification Guide

## Is a notification needed? 
The best way to determine if a notification is appropriate for a scenario is to talk directly with users to understand their needs and expectations. Below are some research questions to consider asking during your conversations with Veterans. These questions will help gather the necessary information to make informed decisions about the value of a notification, what channel to use, when to send the notification, and what information should be included.

### Suggested user research questions
1. Would you like to receive an email or text message in this [scenario]?
2. When would you expect to receive this email or text message?
3. What information is important and why?
4. What information do you NOT want in this email or text message?
5. What information are you comfortable and not comfortable receiving in a digital notification?
6. What would you do with this information? (Ex: save/file away, delete, take action)
7. How do you receive this information today?
8. What has been helpful or unhelpful with what you have received in the past?
9. Would you [start/stop] [behavior] if you received this notification?
10. What device do you use for this type of communication/transaction?

## How do I choose the best communication channel?
Once it is confirmed that a notification is an appropriate interaction for Veterans and the business objective, the next step is to choose whether an email, text message, or other notification type is best for the scenario.

**TODO: insert decision graphic**

**What type of communication type are you considering?**
* Confirmation
* Reminder
* Notice
* Etc

**Does the notification contain information a user would want to save or reference later?**
* Ex: confirmation number, additional instructions, important dates, important links
* [Research] Users prefer email when notifications contain information they would want to reference later or save for their records.

**How much information will be included in the notification**
* A small amount (ex: a few key pieces of information or a single action) or large amount (ex: data elements with an additional paragraph explaining next steps).
* [Research] Text messages are best kept brief (ideally under 160 characters) and have no more than one call to action.

**Does the notification require action?**
* Is the action time sensitive?
* Can the action be done on mobile?
* [Research] Text messages are often viewed more immediately by users.
* [Research] Text messages are generally viewed on a mobile device and users have an expectation that any action that needs to be taken can be done on the same device.
* [Research] Users will often read and address a text message immediately. If there is an expectation to refer back to the text message at a later point, users may have difficulty locating it.

**Is the user expecting the notification?**
* Was an action just performed that could logically trigger the action? Or is this an unexpected notification.
* [Research] Emails provide more ways (sending address, logo, additional personalization) to check the validity of the notification than text messages offer. If the notification is not expected by the user, email provides more safeguards to reassure the user.

**Do most users expect and want this type of notification?**
* Yes, it has been validated the majority of users find this notification valuable.
* No, a minority of users find this notification valuable.
* [Research] Users view unwanted notifications as noise that could ultimately harm their receptiveness to future notifications from VA. If a minority of users find this notification valuable, consider an opt-in approach opposed to opt-out.

| Submission Confirmation             | What was submitted What happens next    | Submission confirmation notifications are sent after the user completes an action such as submitting a form. These notifications include information about the transaction so the user has a record of the action taken and confidence the submission was successful. | Email                     | Email is recommended when including information Veterans would want to save or refer back to such as a confirmation number or important date.                                                                                                                                                              |
| Appointment Reminder                | Confirm Cancel Reschedule               | Appointment reminders are sent [x amount of time] before an upcoming appointment.                                                                                                                                                                                     | Text                      | Appointment reminders are time sensitive. Text messages are more likely to be viewed by Veterans soon after they are sent.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Action Required                     | Need Attention More Information         | Action required notifications are sent to users who need to provide more information or input to a process. These notifications should have a clear path to provide the necessary input and a clear call to action.                                                   | Email or Text             | If the action is time sensitive, short, and can be completed on a mobile device, consider text.  If the action requires a computer, will take longer than 1 minute to complete, or is not time sensitive, consider email.                                                                                  |
| Shipment/Order Updates              | Item shipped Item will arrive           | Shipment and order updates provide users with confirmation or a shipment or order and relevant tracking or reference numbers.                                                                                                                                         | Email or Text             | Content of this notification type works well in both email or text formats. Consider the user’s preference.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Status Change                       | Next step taken Decision made           | Status change notifications proactively provide users with updated  information about a claim, request, benefit, or inquiry. These notifications inform users about a change and provide detail of what changed or a link to view what changed.                       | Email or Text             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Informational Updates / Newsletters | Information you opted in for/ requested | Informational updates and newsletters provide general information.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Email                     | In general, informational updates are longer than a sentence or two making email a better channel.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Secure Messaging                    | New secure message                      | Secure messaging notifications provide limited information to the user and direct them to where the secure message can be accessed.                                                                                                                                   | Email or Text             | Consider how mobile friendly the secure messaging system is. A user should be able to access the message using the same device they receive the notification on. Also consider how time sensitive the message is. Notifications sent via text are more likely to be read immediately after being received. |
