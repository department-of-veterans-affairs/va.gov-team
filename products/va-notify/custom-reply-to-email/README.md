# Custom reply-to email address (no-reply)

## Value Statement

**As a** business line<br>
**I want to** monitor replies from veterans<br>
**So that** I can quickly respond to issues that arise<br>

The mailbox used to send emails is not accessible to those outside VA Notify. We want to keep the from email the same to maintain a consistent veteran experience. However, the reply-to email can be changed, so replies will be captured and monitored by the appropriate group.

## What does this look like?
When the veteran clicks reply or reply all, the desired email address will automatically be populated in the to: field.

## Configuration
This is currently managed by VA Notify. Self-service feature coming soon!
