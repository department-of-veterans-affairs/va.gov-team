## User Problem Statement
It’s hard to navigate all of the VA’s different web properties, being served by different systems.

### User Goals
- Consistent navigation across the new va.gov pages and old teamsite pages

### Business Goals
- Create a cohesive brand across the VA
- Maintain good relations with other VA offices


## Assumptions
- It is technically possible to replicate the functionality of the preview.va.gov header/footer across teamsite properties.
- We can create a consistent experience for users will feel like it is a consistent experience by replacing the header / footer on teamsite properties.

## Scope for Nov 7 Launch
- The header / footer from preview.va.gov should function on the following pages:
   1. Any www.va.gov page that uses teamsite
   2. benefits.va.gov pages 
   3. cem.va.gov pages 
   4. www.choose.va.gov pages

## Solution Approach
- Inject scripts and stylesheets on the teamsite pages to hide the default header / footer and display the preview.va.gov header / footer.

## Value Propositions
- Reduces confusion for user navigation throughout the site
- Improves brand consistency for the VA
- Comradery 'cause we’re all on the same team

## KPIs
- This product does not yet have KPIs.
