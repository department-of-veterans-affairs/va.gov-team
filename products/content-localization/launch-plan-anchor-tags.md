# Phase I: moderated staging environment testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)

Planning:

- Desired date range or test duration: 4-5 busines days
- Desired number of users: 3-5 internal users (minimum)
- How you'll recruit the right test users: Users don't need to be logged in or have a specific profile to use this feature. Therefore, we are going to launch this behind a feature flag and have members of the team test before we roll out to production.
- How you'll conduct the testing: use of flipper feature to test internally on staging and then roll-out at 100% to production.
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: on staging.va.gov (hidden in prod)
- Note: if any launch-gating issues are discovered during testing, we will fix and re-test for 1-2 days. Once we reach the point of no launch-gating items, we will move on to release to the production environment.

Results:

- Number of users: 4
- Number of bugs identified / fixed: 8 (see ticket # https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vft-59c95ae5fda7577a9b3184f8/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/23920 
- Types of errors logged: 
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no
- If yes, what: 


# Phase II: Prod Rollout (also known as unmoderated production testing)


Planning

- Desired date range: 05/18/2021 - 05/31/2021
- How will you make the product available in production while limiting the number of users who can find/access it: n/a
- What metrics-based criteria will you look at before advancing rollout to the next stage ("success criteria")?: n/a since we are rolling out to prod at 100% of users after resolving all issues found during UAT staging test.
