### Context

_You see a problem. Perhaps it’s a problem you face or it’s a problem that affects your team. Typically, you bring these topics up in retros or you raise them with leads or you try to solve them yourself._

_But, you don’t always see improvement._

_One reason is we only address surface-level problems. This may be because resources are easier to come by for “simpler” solutions. Another reason is that as our orgs (DEPO, VSA, Platform, etc.) scale, issues affect more than just you or your team._

_This takes time and energy implementing idea after idea. Not to mention, there are likely a lot of other problems the org must prioritize against, which makes convincing others an uphill climb._

_So, how do we make it easier to prioritize problems our teams face?_

_We need to write things down. We need to take the time to document our thoughts and describe our ideas before presenting a problem so that it’s easier to understand and prioritize. Our approach here is to follow the SCQA framework._

_When might you use the template?:_
- _Tackling large submission payloads and its impacts on the user experience_
- _Addressing accessibility across multiple teams_
- _Improving how your team intakes requests_
- _Decreasing the time it takes for content to be published on VA.gov_
