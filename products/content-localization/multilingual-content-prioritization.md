## Guiding principles
This prioritization takes into account technical blockers and team capacity to ensure that we can follow our 5 guidelines principles for multilingual content:
  - **Relevancy:** Determine the right solutions and priority content for each language based on limited English proficiency need within the Veteran community.
  - **Quality:** Make sure that translated content is clear, accurate, timely, and culturally relevant.
  - **Accessibility:** Make sure that translated content is accessible to all who need it, including those with low or no vision or hearing, low literacy, and cognitive issues.
  - **Equity:** Take the same care with multilingual content as we do with English content. And create solutions that are equitable for all (including bilingual VA employees for whom adding translation on top of core responsibilities can be an undue burden).
  - **Sustainability:** Scope translation content and solutions appropriately and establish foundational processes and systems to maintain quality over time. 

## Document scope
- This approach applies only to content that's on modernized VA.gov pages and that speaks directly to Veterans, service members, and their family members. We don't translate content for other audiences.
- This prioritization doesn't include the [Veteran and Family Member Information Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2093/text/pl?overview=closed) law direction for fact sheets. That is a separate enterprise-wide effort.

## Prioritizing languages

We prioritize languages for VA.gov content translation based on these 3 factors:
- Estimated total volume of language need
- Estimated share of language speakers with limited English proficiency
- Estimated volume of language speakers seeking information specifically on VA.gov

### Estimated total volume of language need

Population data shows the following for total volume of language need:

  - Significanty more Hispanic or Latino Veterans speak a language other than English than Veterans of any other race or ethnicity (761,404 Hispanic or Latino Veterans vs. 434,147 for the next highest group, White, non-Hispanic Veterans).(Reference 1)

  - Spanish is by far the top language Veterans who are immigrants to the U.S. speak at home (26% for Spanish vs. next highest language at 9% for Tagalog). (Reference 2).

    - Of the top 3 bilingual Veteran populations by race or ethnicity, the Hispanic or Latino Veteran population is projected to have the most growth over the coming decades.This group is projected to grow to be 12% of the total Veteran population by 2044. (Reference 3)

    - 16% of active-duty spouses and 12% of reserve component spouses identify as Hispanic or Latino.

### Share of language speakers with limited English proficiency

Population data shows the following for share of language speakers with limited English proficiency:
  - Nearly 40,000 more Hispanic or Latino Veterans report having limited English proficiency than any other group.
  - Among the U.S. resident population who speak a language other than English at home, 40% of residents who speak Spanish report having limited English proficiency.
  - Spanish is the top language by far for VA medical center and contact center requests for interpreters (based on limited data).
  - Analytics data shows the following about the volume of language speakers seeking information specifically on VA.gov:
  - Nearly 70% of people visiting VA.gov with their browser set to a language other than English have their browser set to Spanish.
  - Spanish pageviews and engagement with available Spanish content continues to increase. Spanish COVID-19 content on VA.gov (COVID-19 content and language and assistance resources pages) had a total of 9,519 pageviews in June, 2021. Engagement grew to 161,476 pageviews by December, 2021.

## Prioritizing content by topic

We prioritize VA.gov content for translation based on these 3 factors:
- Policy guidance on vital information to translate
- Analytics data on most visited content in languages other than English
- Usability research with Veterans and family members

### Priority 1: COVID-19 vaccine and benefit access information

This content is our top priority for translation. It includes the following types of content:

- Basic content on how to get a COVID-19 vaccine (including boosters) at VA and relevant associated information
- Basic information about how to access COVID-19 testing at VA
- How the coronavirus pandemic may impact VA benefits and services

### Priority 2: Basic rights and assistance content

This content is our 2nd top priority for translation. It includes these 3 types of content:

- Content that explains Veterans' basic rights at VA (such as civil rights and patient rights) and how to file complaints or get help to resolve concerns
- Content that explains how to get access to language assistance (such as how to get an interpreter by phone or in person)
- Content about the IRS 1095-B form from VA

### Priority 3: Vital benefit content for initial benefit access

This content is our 2nd top priority for translation. It includes this content for each benefit:

- Basic eligibilty information
- Basic information on how to apply (not including the online application)

Refer to the next section for how we're prioritizing content by benefit.

### Priority 4: Select, high-value vital benefit content for fully accessing and managing benefits, with an emphasis on content that requires a response from the Veteran or family member

This content includes select additional benefit content that meets either of these criteria:

- The content requires a response or action from the Veteran or family member that, if not taken, could lead to negative consequences for that individual (such as content on debt)
- Search data and usability research show the content to be of particular importance to Veterans and family members seeking content in Spanish (for example, medical appointments and travel reimbursement)

## Prioritizing content by benefit

Within vital benefit content for initial access, we prioritize benefits based on need.

Analytics data shows the following:

- Disability and health care are top areas of current pageviews for people who visit VA.gov with their browsers set to Spanish.

- All of the top 10 pdf forms downloaded by people with their browsers set to Spanish are health care and disability forms.
