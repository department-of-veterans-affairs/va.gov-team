# CMS + Localization Meeting 7/19/2021

Purpose: Define direction of research for localiztion efforts

Details:

* The content-build system needs to be overhauled for various reasons, and that is the main blocker in regards to using the official Drupal multiligual modules.
* Training requirements needs to be considered, and migrating from one system to another is going to impact training and documentation needs. This can also introduce confusion and UX issues for editors.
* An 'entity reference' approach may be a short term solution to further explore, but any implementation will require cross teams collaboration from VSP / CMS / Websites
* CMS is currently unable to take on any additional work at this time. Staffing is limited and will likely not improve for some months. CMS is maintaining the content-build system along with several other systems, and will be looking at replacing it with a different approach in the distant future.
* Adam may be able to dedicate some development time to facilitate improvements on the CMS/content-build side, but those logistics are unclear.
* Further exploration is warrented for the existing React component's potential as well as the entity reference approach.
