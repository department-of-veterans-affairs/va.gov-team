# Language considerations

## Summary
- As of 2016, approximately 40,000 immigrants served in the armed forces, 5,000 noncitizens enlisted each year, and 511,000 Veterans were born outside of the U.S. In addition, net growth in the U.S. population of 18- to 29-year-olds (the segment most likely to enlist) is predicted to come entirely from immigrants and the children of immigrants. [Reference]

- Based on data of the most common language for LEP U.S. residents and the most common languages other than English spoken in the homes of immigrant Veterans, the top languages to consider for translation are (in order): Spanish, Tagalog, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Korean.

## Languages common for LEP U.S. residents

In 2009-2013, the top 10 languages spoken by LEP U.S. residents in order of most to least number of speakers (with % share of speakers who are LEP) were:
1.	Spanish (44% LEP) 
2.	Chinese (55% LEP)
3.	Tagalog (32% LEP)
4.	Vietnamese (60% LEP)
5.	French (20% LEP)
6.	Korean (55% LEP)
7.	German (16% LEP)
8.	Arabic (37% LEP)
9.	Other Asian (31% LEP)
10.	African (32% LEP)

## LEP and languages common in homes of immigrant Veterans

Compared to the overall U.S. foreign-born population, immigrant veterans are much less likely to be Limited English Proficient (LEP). According to the 2017 ACS, the most recent data with information on both English proficiency and veteran status, 20 percent of immigrant veterans were LEP, versus 49 percent of the total foreign-born population.

**Note:** Limited English proficiency refers to those who indicated on the ACS questionnaire that they spoke English less than “very well.”

In 2017, 38 percent of immigrant veterans reported speaking only English at home. 

The remainder spoke a wide range of languages, including:
1.	Spanish (26%)
2.	Tagalog (9%)
3.	Chinese (3%) and French/Haitian Creole (3%)
4.	Vietnamese (2%), German (2%), and Korean (2%)

## Health equity information

There's a wealth of information here (some pulled out specifically below):

### Race and ethnicity projections

From 2019 to 2045, the racial and ethnic composition of Veterans will change. The projected proportion of Veterans who are Non-Hispanic White will decrease from 74% to 61%. Other groups will have increases:
- 12% to 15% among Black Veterans
- 8% to 12% among Hispanic Veterans
- 2.1% to 3.9% among Mutiple Race Veterans
- 1.5% to 3.3% among Other Race Veterans
- 1.6% to 2.7% among Asian Veterans
- 0.7% to 1.6% among American Indian and Alaska Native Veterans
- 0.2% to 0.3% among Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Island Veterans

### Health conditions by race and ethnicity

Among Veterans age 18-44 using VHA in FY 2014, the most common diagnosed condition was post-traumatic stress disorder affecting 24% of patients.

Rates were highest among:
- American Indian or Alaska Native patients (31%)
- Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander patients (28%)

### Translation needs around specific health conditions

"Despite overall high quality of care, Hispanic Veterans are more likely to have poorly controlled diabetes than their white, non-Hispanic counterparts. Hispanic Veterans can benefit from programs that connect them with culturally and linguistically appropriate comprehensive diabetes management and prevention programs that may include promotores (Spanish speaking community workers), peer mentors, support groups, and formal nutrition and diabetes self-management training. An OHE-supported project with VA Heart of Texas Health Care Network (VISN 17) developed and delivered a culturally sensitive MOVE! curriculum aimed to address the specific needs of Hispanic Veterans with diabetes in Texas. Participants who participated in at least one MOVE! Diabetes session
experienced significant improvements in long term diabetes control."

## VA.gov usability research findings

What people are looking for on VA.gov:
“On VA website but in English, and will share info with wife but verbally Like survivor benefit info in Spanish would be useuful in case anything ever happened to him, became incapicated or died. I served with many Latino veterans but they were all fluent in English. But it would be for their family members maybe it could be helpful.”
I expected the link to be in the top right hand corner. Took a second but found it."

"The menu links [he means the left nav] are in English. For me, it's fine but someone with limited English who needed this page in Spanish would need the menu in Spanish too."

"If I can go back and forth with my wife, flip back n forth from Spanish to English, [to help his wife but verify with English for himself]. For example with paper applications, like for food stamps, I put it side by side, the English and Spanish version. Usually can't do that with websites. Thinking more from the point of view of a mother or spouse, who would find Spanish helpful, not so much Veterans.
