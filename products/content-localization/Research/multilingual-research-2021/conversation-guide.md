## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today. My name is [Danielle/Eunice] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how VA can best meet the needs of Veterans and their family members and caregivers who may need or prefer content about VA benefits and services in Spanish. 

Before we start, I'd like to ask you if you would prefer to conduct this interview in English or Spanish, or a mix of both depending on the questions?

_[Note: Eunice will likely lead all sessions, unless we have a scheduling conflict and know that the participant doesn't have limited English proficiency themselves. Eunice will translate this conversation guide into Spanish so she can switch to Spanish if needed. Danielle will be the primary notetaker. But we're working to recruit a Spanish-speaking notetaker or will use recordings to capture notes if we need to switch to Spanish.]_

There are also a few things I want to mention before we start:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve VA.gov to better meet the needs of Veterans and their family members and caregivers. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5-10 minutes

I'd like to start now with learning a little more about you and how you use VA benefits and services.

  - How often do you or your family members use VA.gov to learn about, apply for, or manage benefits and services? 
  - Do you have an account (like DS Logon, My HealtheVet, or ID.me) that you use to sign in to VA.gov?

Now, I'm going to ask you some questions about how you and [your family members/the Veteran] get the information you need about benefits and services in your preferred language.

- Do you and [your family/the Veteran] primarily speak Spanish, English, or another language at home? Can you tell me about your and [your family members'/the Veteran's] level of comfort with English vs. Spanish?
