# Research Plan for Content & Localization team, Multilingual content research, August 24, 2021
As the product owner, I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	

## Goals	

### 1. What product & team are you doing this research for?
Content and localization team – Sustainable translation solutions discovery work	

### 2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?

We are taking a phased approach to translating VA.gov benefit hub content for Veterans and their family members with limited English proficiency (LEP):
- **Phase 1:** Translate 2 main COVID-19 pages into Spanish and Tagalog
- **Phase 2:** Launch language assistance and resources pages in English, Spanish, and Tagalog
- **Phase 3:** Provide a picture of how VA can move forward with sustainable translation solutions

As part of Phase 3, we’re interviewing VA employees who serve Veterans and family members with LEP as well as employees of other federal agencies who serve individuals with LEP. We’d like to also interview Veterans and family members with LEP themselves. This will help us understand how best to meet their needs as we plan for the future.

### 3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?

#### Interview portion questions

##### 1. What does a good experience with online translated content look like for Veterans and their families with LEP?
- How do they currently search for translated content online (outside of VA)? 
- What types of content do they most need translated?

##### 2. How do Veterans and their families with LEP navigate VA services currently?
- If they needed to apply for a VA benefit, would they apply online, by mail, call, or go in person?
- If they needed language assistance to apply, how would they try to get it—and what type of assistance would be most helpful (i.e., phone or in-person assistance from an interpreter, a translated PDF to mail in, a translated online application, etc.)?
- Where do they expect to find this content on VA.gov?

##### 3. Are Veterans currently receiving language assistance from VA?
- If yes, how do they get that assistance (i.e., in person, by phone, through relatives or friends, setting their Internet browser to a language other than English, etc.)?
- How do they currently use VA.gov or other VA websites?

_Note: These interview questions are intended to add more insights to analytics and other quantitative data. We don't expect to get the full picture from this study alone. We also intend to continue to do future research studies with our LEP audiences to gather more insights over time._

#### Usability test

#### 4. How findable and valuable is the current translated VA.gov content?
- Do our currently translated COVID-19 pages offer value beyond the English content? How could we offer greater value?
- Can Veterans and family members with LEP find the current Language Assistance and Resources pages on VA.gov? Do these pages offer value? How could we improve them?
- Do  Veterans and their family members with LEP need or want the ability to print or share information they find on VA.gov?
- Do Veterans and family members with LEP notice a callout about getting language assistance by phone on an English page? If yes, would they call if they needed help with reading the information? 

### 4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?

- **For generative research:** 
  - By talking directly with Veterans and family members with LEP, we can gain insights that will help us best serve their needs moving forward.
  - We hypothesize that the volume of use of existing language assistance at VA may be artificially lower because of lack of awareness that this assistance exists.
  - We hypothesize that Veterans and family members with LEP may have specific content that's a higher priority to have in their first language.
- **For current translated VA.gov content:** 
  - We hypothesize that the Language Assistance and Resources pages are hard to find in the footer.
  - We hypothesize that the Language Assistance and Resources pages offer some basic value, but are limited due to scope and ability to build out full sections rather than one page for each language.
  - We hypothesize that the value of the translated COVID-19 pages are limited by the fact that most of the links (except for some links to translated CDC content) go to English-language pages.

## Method	

### 1.	What method of research are you planning?

We are planning 1-hour, remote moderated interviews that will combine ethnographic interviews and usability testing with our live site and potentially a high-fidelity prototype.

### 2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?

Interviews will help us learn directly from Veterans and their family members about how we can best serve their needs with translated content.

### 3.	Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)*	
Online using Zoom.

### 4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)*

We’ll be testing our existing Spanish translated pages:
https://www.va.gov/asistencia-y-recursos-en-espanol/
https://www.va.gov/health-care/covid-19-vaccine-esp/

We’ll also be testing a high-fidelity mockup of a page with a language assistance callout.	

### 5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)		

We’ll use Zoom for these interviews.

## Participants and Recruitment	

### 1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  

25 participants (for a minimum of 12 completed sessions)

Please list your participant criteria in two categories-

#### 1. Primary criteria / Must have

- Participants must be a Veteran or must be actively helping a Veteran. 

- Participants must speak Spanish and/or must be actively helping a Veteran, family member, or caregiver who speaks Spanish to access or manage their VA benefits. 

- Participants and/or the Veteran, family member, or caregiver they’re helping must have limited English proficiency. We’ll follow the Census Bureau’s way of identifying individuals with LEP. The person must answer “Not at all” or “Not well” to this question. <br> How well [do you/does your family member or caregiver] speak English?
  - Not at all (Qualify)
  - Not well (Qualify)
  - Well (Disqualify)
  - Very well (Disqualify)

#### 2. **Secondary criteria / Would like to have** - what other criteria would strengthen your results?
 - At least 2 participants who have signed in to their VA.gov account within the past 6 months
 - At least 2 participants who are enrolled in VA health care
 - At least 2 participants who weren't born in the U.S. or who have at least 1 parent who wasn’t born in the U.S.
 - At least 1 person who doesn’t have a college degree (to include enlisted Veterans)
 - At least 1 person who has identified cognitive impairments and/or functional disabilities. Examples of diagnoses that may align with this would be Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, and vertigo. Other conditions may be aphasia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, distractibility, memory loss, reading difficulties, low tolerance for cognitive overload, and intellectual/adaptive functioning challenges such as learning and problem-solving.
 - At least 1 person who identifies as LGBTQ+ 
 - At least 1 person who uses a screen reader or other assistive device

#### 2.	What is your recruitment strategy?

We will use the Perigean contract. In addition, we will share recruitment flyers with these groups for distribution:
 - Health equity office
 - Center for Minority Veterans and minority Veteran coordinators
 - Employees at VA facilities who handle incoming requests for interpreters and translation services
 - Caregiver program coordinators

## When? 	

#### 1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research?

Our goal is to do this research in mid September.

#### 2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready?

Most of the content is ready. We will have a mockup of the page with the callout to phone assistance ready by September 10.
	
#### 3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be?**
 - < 1-hour sessions
 - 30-minute buffer between sessions
