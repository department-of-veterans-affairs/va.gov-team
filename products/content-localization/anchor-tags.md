**Product Outline: Anchor Tag (Experiment)**
 
**Overview**

The goal of our experiment is to offer a quick and easy way for vets, caretakers, contact center representatives and others to share specific Q/A’s through the addition of anchor links.

By adding shareable anchor links to a heavily trafficked page we can launch quickly and determine whether it meets user’s needs and warrants deployment across the VA.gov site.The Coronavirus FAQ page is both highly trafficed and has a lengthy list of FAQs:

https://www.va.gov/coronavirus-veteran-frequently-asked-questions/ 


**Problem Statement**

Today, question/answer links are not automatically generated in a way that's easily accessible by visitors to the Coronavirus FAQs page. They would need to go into 'inspect' element in their browser to find the link and most users don't do that, even if they know how.

So when a vet, caregiver or customer service representative wants to direct someone to a specific question/answer on the Coronavirus FAQ page, they can only share a link at the page level leaving it up to the recipient to navigate through the long list of information to find the specific content they seek. This can be frustrating and time-consuming.

The goal of this experiment is to make it quick and painless to share specific content contained within a page.

Desired User Outcomes

- Ability to quickly share specific content 
- Eliminate burden on recipient having to scroll/search the page for relevant info

Undesired User Outcomes

- Adding an icon and feature that users don’t engage with
- Causing confusion with the introduction of a new icon and feature

Desired Business Outcomes

- Help vets/caretakers get to the relevant content quickly
- Drive more traffic to web page vs call center
- Determine if feature is worthwhile before supporting site-wide
- Leverage for marketing campaigns or correspondence sent to users

Undesired Business Outcomes

- Drive additional call volume to contact center
- Frustrate and/or confuses users
 
**Measuring Success**

Working with the Analytics team, we're seeing an average of 1.5% CTR for links within the body of content. Using this as our benchmark we would like to see a 1.5% or greater engagement for the anchor links on this page.

(Any data on how often the call centers share links today or an added value this would provide?)

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

To determine whether our experiment is delivering value to users, we will initially be most interested in metrics related to engagement/usage. 


| Category         | KPI           |
| -------------    | ------------- |
| Ease of Use      | Engagement: # of shares per link   
|Service Completion| Traffic from shared links                    


**Objectives and Key results (OKRs)**

To measure feature engagement, we will look at:
- CTR for anchor links
- Number of links shared vs 
- Number of page views originating from a shared link
 
**Assumptions**

_Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality_

**Solution Approach**

_What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?_

- We are starting with the Coronavirus FAQ page since this page contains a number of accordion and non-accordion H2 question headers. Additionally,  it is a highly trafficked page which will enable us to see meaningful data in a relatively short timeframe.

_What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?_

- Since this is a proof-of-concept we are only going to add the anchor tags on the Coronavirus FAQ (english) page as a way to quickly test user engagement and confirm functionality. This will enable us to move quickly and gather data to make an informed decision before deploying on a larger scale.

_How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?_

- To make the solution scale site-wide we will need to ……
 
**Go-to-market Strategy**

_How are Veterans and others using this product going to know it exists?_

- Will coordinate with contact center leads and provide training materials.

- Anything else?

_What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful?_

- Awareness and support of contact center representatives
