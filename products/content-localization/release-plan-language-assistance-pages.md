## Phase I: moderated staging environment testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)

### Planning:

- Desired date range or test duration: 4-5 busines days
- Desired number of users: 3-5 internal users (minimum)
- How you'll recruit the right test users: 
     - Users don't need to be logged in or have a specific profile to use this feature. Therefore, we are going to launch this behind a feature flag and have members of the team test before we roll out to production.
- How you'll conduct the testing: 
     - Using flipper feature to test internally on staging and then phased roll-out to production.
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: 
     - on staging.va.gov (hidden in prod)
-  Note: if any launch-gating issues are discovered during testing, we will fix and re-test for 1-2 days. Once we reach the point of no launch-gating items, we will move on to phased release to the production environment.

### Results:

- Number of users: 
- Number of bugs identified / fixed: 
- Types of errors logged:
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no
     - If yes, what:

## Phase II: Prod Rollout (also known as unmoderated production testing)

- Desired date range:  06/07/2021 - 06/10/2021
- How will you make the product available in production while limiting the number of users who can find/access it: 
     - feature flag
- What metrics-based criteria will you look at before advancing rollout to the next stage ("success criteria")?: 
     - if no gating issues from Staging Review we will release at 100% 
- Go Live!
