## What is the Problem to be Solved?

Veterans and their family members with limited English proficiency (LEP) don't have access to essential VA content online in their native language. 
We outline 3 key aspects of this problem:

- Lack of a sustainable, strategic approach to translated content: VA has existing guidance for complying with Executive Order 13166, Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency, 65 Fed. 50,121 (Aug. 16, 2000). But VA currently doesn't currently prioritize localization of digital content in a programmatic and sustainable way. Some translated materials do exist, but they're scattered and there is no current organization-wide program to ensure that we're translating essential content or keeping translated content accurate and up to date.

- Other readability and health literacy issues that further compound the problem: Research has shown that low health literacy causes risks to both the person and the health care system, and that as anxiety increases, readability and health literacy decrease even further for everyone.
  - “People with low health literacy use more health care services, have a greater risk for hospitalization, and have a higher utilization of expensive services, such as emergency care and inpatient admissions. Vulnerable populations include older adults, immigrant populations, minority populations, and low income populations.” [footnote i.] 
  - “Anxiety acts as both a catalyst for information seeking and an obstacle to the ability to read and interpret written messages…when [no information] is found or when the message itself is difficult to comprehend, anxiety is likely to rise…This cycle…can fuel panic and lead to maladaptive behaviors, such as unnecessary trips to emergency rooms or overuse of other emergency resources.” [footnote ii.]

- Congressional pressure: Additionally, Congress has recently asked VHA to provide COVID-19 content (and other essential content) in Spanish and Tagalog. As we work to meet this important and timely need we also need to be working toward an effective and sustainable approach for the future.

## Objectives

Through research, analysis, and stakeholder interviews we will identify and recommend a scalable and sustainable potential solution to provide Veterans and their family members with LEP access to essential benefit and service content in their native language that is:

- Accurate
- Timely
- Compassionate
- Clear and written in plain language

This solution will take into consideration the complexities that product owners, content creators, and local site administrators face with providing high-quality translated information that can be easily kept up to date.

At the conclusion of this project, we will have a written evaluation of this solution to present to leadership as a potential long-term solution for supporting translated content across essential benefit content on VA.gov. 

We will also provide a report further detailing the needs of our Veterans and family members with LEP and recommendations for how we can best prioritize and scope content translation to support those needs.

Specifically, our objectives are as follows:

1. To provide English-as-a-second-language (ESL) or limited-English-proficiency (LEP) Veterans, other family member beneficiaries, and family caregivers access to plain language health and benefit content, so they have equal access to the information and benefits they have earned.
2. Give Veterans clear and concise information on accessing translation services.
3.	To meet federal/agency requirements for providing translated benefit information.
4.	Provide turn-key solution for content writers/editors using an automated workflow and machine-aided human translations.
5.	Research and identify requirements for a scaleable enterprise solution. This includes:
a.	Budget estimates
b. Resource needs
b.	Process for selecting and on-boarding a software provider for integration with Drupal
c.	Integration points
d.	Dependencies

The audiences we will address include:
1.	Vets/caretakers
2.	Product Owners
3.	Writers
4.	Local Sites (eg VAMC's?)

Desired User Outcomes
- Limited English proficiency (LEP) Veterans, family members and caregivers have a better understanding of the VA benefits and services they have earned.
- Product Owners and writers have a sustainable, automated approach for providing translated content.
- Local Sites….TBD

Undesired User Outcomes
- Veterans, family members and caregivers find content confusing or unhelpful.
- Veterans, family members and caregivers can't easily find or use translated content.

Desired Business Outcomes
- Meet federal/agency requirements for providing translated benefit information.
- VHA demonstrates to Congress that we are providing essential COVID-19 information in Spanish and Tagalog while working towards a viable longer-term approach
- DEPO/OCTO Health provides a solid recommendation for a sustainable localization program at VA, based on ~MVP~ evaluation, data and user feedback
- VA provides relevant, easy-to-find, high-quality content for LEP Veterans and their families in the languages they most need (Spanish first)
- Product Owners and writers have a clear, manageable process for providing translated content and keeping it up-to-date

Undesired Business Outcomes

- VHA can't demonstrate progress on translation efforts in a timely way
- DEPO/OCTO Health can't gather the data we need to make solid recommendations for translations
- VA continues with a scattered or unsustainable approach to translations

## Our Bet(s)

If we provide Veterans and their caregives better visibility to existing translated content and develop an easier approach for translating additional content, 
we will provide Vets access to essential VA content online in their native language.

[x] Phase 1 (short-term): provide in-language pages for critical and time sensitive Covid-19 information

[ ] Phase 2 (mid-term): add highly visible navigational elements to the VA homepage to provide quick access to existing translated content and information for in-language support assistance and resources.

[ ] Phase 3 (Recommendation for long-term approach):  research and document an enterprise solution that considers needs of internal stakeholders and vets, leverages our existing infrastructure and is scaleable. 

## Measuring Success

Baseline Analytics:(note: create table)

During March 2021 the total number of pageviews for the Covid-10 and Corona FAQ pages in Spanish and Tagalog were ~7000.
Jan and Feb 2021 saw ~40k users with browsers set to Spanish visiting VA.gov each month.
From Jan 1 - March 15, 2021 the total number of pageviews across VA.gov with browser set to “Spanish” ~600k. 

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
•	Analytics around the engagement and usage for the translated page(s)
•	Measurements for search and direct traffic to the Spanish pages 
•	Direct user feedback via usability testing
•	Customer feedback via Medallia survey 
•	Shorter time to publish?
•	Reduction in translation costs?

From KPI worksheet:
- Customer Engagement/Pageviews 
- Time to generate and deploy translated content (north star metric, intenral)
- Net Promoter Score (NPS) - how likely to recommend? (internal)
- Average satisfaction rating across translated VA.gov

## Product Requirements 

- Phase 1: provide Spanish versions of the Corona FAQs, ~Research Volunteer~ and Covid-19 Vaccine pages 
- Phase 2: create a highly visible navigational element on the VA/gov homepage that leads Spanish and Tagalog users to an in-language resource page
- Phase 3: research and document an enterprise-wide recommendation that considers needs of internal stakeholders and vets, leverages our existing infrastructure and is scaleable. 

Out of Scope
- Site-wide roll-out or centralized translation management
- Non-content pages (ie: tools, VAMCs)
- Updates/changes to pages found during translation effort that need updates (bugs will be captured and addressed by team owners)
- other chanels including notifications, email, snail mail). SK note: this could be a big driver for saving on translation costs - enabling other depts to leverage database)

Assumptions
Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality
- Some Veterans and their family members need or prefer COVID-19 and other content about VA health care and benefits in Spanish and Tagalog.
- Users will be able to find and easily link/toggle to translated content.  
- Mid-term approach will build new pages in Github 
- Google translate widget or machine learning alone will not be an acceptable translation option for our users or for Tier 1 content.
- An expeditious process for completing internal needs analysis and vetting software solutions/partners by June 2021 (RISKY)

## Solution Approach

*What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there? 

We are going to start with translating the Coronavirus FAQs and Covid-19 Vaccine pages via a front-end solution (not involving Drupal) into Spanish and Tagalog. We'll then widen translation offerings by building a nav link from the homepage to in-language resource pages for Spanish and Tagalog speakers. This will enable them to more easily locate existing translated content and provide information on how to access translation support.

For the long-term enterprise solution recommendation we will be investigating options that use a combination of machine and human translators which we expect to a more efficient approach to providing and updating translated content.

*Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches? 

The short and mid-term approaches outlined above are the quickest and simplest solution that allows us to start providing translated content while conducting research and gathering data to help inform a long-term solution.

*What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why? 

- We're not including Drupal integration for Corona/Covid work because we don't have the resources to support the work.
- We will only support the short and mid-term approaches for a handful of critical pages since the approach we use is resource intensive and not sustainable
- We wont support translations for non-content pages such as forms since is more complex and may require a different approach.

*How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?

- We'll base the evolution on data and user feedback. We expect that we'll move toward a machine-and-human translation approach as part of a broader localization program.

*What’s Next
- Conduct stakeholder interviews (internal)
- Research and engage with potential software partners and other agencies within the government
- Develop a recommendation document that includes technical research and internal stakeholders needs

## Translation vs Localization

Translation

Converting content from the source language to the target language, respecting grammar rules and syntax.


Localization

Adapts messaging to local audiences and addresses cultural as well as non-textual components. Date formats, text length differences and layouts, currency units are all considerations when "localizing" content.

Aspects of Localization

Translation of the product's interface and documentation
Colours, images, graphics and icons: adapting to cultural and legal requirements
Rendering (can we display the text correctly, does the new text fit inside the allocated space), fonts (do we have fonts and characters for the language), bi-directional text needed in Arabic and other languages.
Locale data: how to display dates, time, number, currency and other regional data.
