## How we work

Workflow and Communications
   
#### Stand-up
Check in on people and product progress

- Every Mon, Wed and Fri @ 12.30 pm Eastern 
- 20 min
- 3 Question Format: What did you do yesterday? What will you do today? Any impediments?
- We use the daily Slack thread to share any links, questions, and notes that come up


#### Creating Tickets
Anyone on the team can create a user story. We work in this repo: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team / https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team 

department-of-veterans-affairs / va.gov-team

- For a story to go in the **"Backlog"** column and be groomed, it should have:
    - Title that explains the goal in plain language
    - Clear acceptance criteria
    - Definition of done  
    - Labels: vsa-content-localization
    - Link to Epic "Enterprise Translation Recommendation: https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vft-59c95ae5fda7577a9b3184f8/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/22379


   
- For a task to go into the **"Ready"** column, it must have the following:
   - Estimate      
- During Sprint Planning, we'll move tickets into the **"Current Sprint"** column
- As they are worked, tickets get moved into **"In Progress"**

- For a task to be in **"Blocked"** 
   - An external dependency prevents the ticket from being completed
   
- For a task to be in **"Validate"** 
   - All work related to the ticket is implemented
   - Acceptance criteria have been met
   - Work is accessible in a review instance and ready for internal team members to review

- For a task to be **"Done"** 
   - Internal validation has occured
   - Merged to main
   - Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect when validation has occurred and by whom
   - Any next steps (turning on in Production, stakeholder review, follow up tickets) have been documented

#### Estimation
We use fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) to account for the level of effort, complexity, and amount of unknowns in our work. Here is our guide:
| Number | Meaning |
| -------| --------|
| 1  | Involves a single small trivial change.
| 2  | Small but non-trivial change, requires some care.
| 3  | (Baseline) Contains some complexity or uncertainty.
| 5  | Significant complexity and/or uncertainty.
| 8  | High level of complexity and/or uncertainty.
| 13 | Needs to be broken down; too large for one sprint; critical unknowns. 


#### User story validation
- All team members are responsible for validation, but different team members will specialize in different areas.
- For anything considered a "release" or significant change, Tze (the VSA QA lead) will be responsible for QA
- Engineers will be responsible for ensuring and documenting in the ticket that all acceptance criteria are met
- Design is responsible for ensuring that design and content specifications are met
- PM and PO will be responsible for end-to-end QA and communication to stakeholders


#### Slack

 - This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication. Channel link: https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C01GCADCMQT
 
 
#### PTO
- Team members will send calendar invites to the rest of team when they have scheduled time off 

#### General things
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
