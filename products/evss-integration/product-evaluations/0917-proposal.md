# eBenefits Usability Product Evaluation

## About

The goal of this project is to "help us learn what is working or not working with existing products." Specifically, the vets.gov team wants to evaluate existing products on [eBenefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/homepage) so that the team can better prioritize, plan and account for how much work remains. In addition, this work will give the team that takes on this work information they need to get started. 

- The Veteran Profile
   - Frog research might cover this
- The Disability Compensation Application 
- The Request for State Benefits Application
- The Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) Application
- Modifying Dependents Application
- Find a Representative for VA Claims
- Home Loan Certificate of Eligibility
- Request Official Military Personnel File (DPRIS)

## Roles

Business Owner: Rachael Roueche

Research Designer: Laura Cochran

VA Wrangler: TBD

Usability observers: 

Usability notetakers: 

## Methods

A mix of research methods will make sure we are capturing attitudes and behaviors related to these products. 

__Business Owner and Subject Matter Expert Interviews__

Business Owner and topic expert interviews conducted to get a glimpse into the problem ecosystem -- the people, places, organizations and technologies related to the product. 

Estimate: 15 hours per product / x hours total

__Data Mining__

In the past we've been able to get access to contact center reports as well as analytics on how people use eBenefits today. This information will show us trends and support and/or rebute what we hear from stakeholders. 

Example: 4 hours per product / x hours total

__Heuristic Review__

The heuristic review will provide gaps in the design based on checklist of accepted usability principles. This information might be redundant to what we learn from stakeholders and data mining. If necessary, a light heuristic review could supplement what we learn though. Heuristic evaluation is not a substitute for usability tests.

Estimate: 4 hours per product / x hours total 

__Baseline Usability Testing__

Once we understand the domain better, we can create a list of questions and hypotheses that'll inform what behaviors we need to observe during usability testing. Usability testing will give us a baseline for what the user experience is today.

Estimate: two weeks for recruiting; 4 to 8 hours for testing; one week for synthesis and reporting. 

## Timeline

### Phase: Stakeholder and Subject Matter Expert Interviews, Data Mining

__Deliverables__

|Week|Deliverable|Description|
|---|---|---|
|1|5 to 7 60-minute interviews|Laura and Rachael will interview five to seven people that are either stakeholders or subject matter experts to better understand the products.|
|2|Preliminary Assessment Readout|Key learnings from each interview and the data mining: the user's experience with pain points; the biggest opportunities and challenges for the business.|

__Opportunities__

- Understand history of the products
- Get expert opinion on product's biggest pain points
- This will help us identify areas to focus on during usability testing

__Risks__

- Business owner bias
- Potential rabbit holes 

### Phase: Optional Heuristic Reviews

__Deliverables__

|Week|Deliverable|Description|
|---|---|---|
|2|Heuristic Assessments|Personal assessment of usability, efficiency, and effectiveness of the interfaces.|

__Opportunities__

- This will also help us identify areas to focus on during usability testing. 
- It will give us feedback in a less resource intensive way

__Risks__

- Typically multiple usabilty experts review to offset designer bias
- It will best identify minor areas of focus and will not identify major issues or could mislead on major issues

### Phase: Baseline Usability Testing

__Deliverables__

|Week|Deliverable|Description|
|---|---|---|
|3|Research Design|Create the usability research plan(s) with goals, hypotheses, participant profiles, dates and recruitment plan. Determine what products can be assessed simutaneously.|
|3|Tool Assessment|Determine best tools to use for usability test.|
|4, 5|Participant Recruitment|Recruit 4 to 6 particicpants for usability testing.|
|4, 5|Discussion Guide|Create discussion guide for usability test.|
|6, 7|Usability Sessions|Conduct 60-minute usability sessions based on the goals identified in the research plans.|
|7|Synthesis|Key insights from the usability sessions.|
|8|Research Readout|Create report for research readout and socialize the findings.|

__Opportunities__

- Observing behavior will help us confirm assumptions we have about the usability of the forms

__Risks__

- Recruiting! We will need 4 to 6 people per proposed research plan.
