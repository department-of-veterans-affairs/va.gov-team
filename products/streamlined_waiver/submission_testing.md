Was updated on 10/3/23 when asked to take a second look. this particular submission was eligible for streamlined waiver (flag on + only VHA copays selected) but their income puts them over the GMT Threshold but still under the 150% threshold (long path when taking into account assets). GMT Threshold for their zip is $60,700, the Veteran has a net monthly income of $3,136 and their spouse of $2,583; over the course of 12 months that puts them at (3136 + 2583) * 12 = $68,628. So I'm seeing $60,700 < $68,628 < $91,050 which we would then evaluate for the long form path which is where their assets put them over...currently| Removal of Assets from calculation GH#66245|  Issue Resolved?
