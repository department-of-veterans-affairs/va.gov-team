[P4] 14:08:01
Okay.

[Moderator] 14:08:05
My next question is about your service in the military. Can you please tell me about the most important or memorable or meaningful parts of your service?

[P4] 14:08:06
Wow. At first it was just going in the military. It was just being a part of the Air Force.

[P4] 14:08:17
Basic training, tech school, all of that was, really. Was good and then I got to my permanent change of station and that was at CASS or for space in ---.

[P4] 14:08:28
That was tough. But it was in ---- and When I say there are no black people who live there, there were no black people who live there.

[Moderator] 14:08:40
Hmm.

[P4] 14:08:42
So I couldn't get the things. I needed even when I went downtown and that was that was really tough.

[Moderator] 14:08:46
Hmm.

[P4] 14:08:46
So it was almost culture, well it was culture shock. And, I think that as I

[P4] 14:08:55
As the days went by, I hated it even more. I can't say that there was a lot that I enjoyed about it.

[Moderator] 14:08:59
Hmm.

[P4] 14:09:04
I was just waiting for my time to be over. I don't know if that's what you wanna know.

[P4] 14:09:12
I cannot tell you a whole lot that was that was really good for me because I think that the bad outweigh the good so much.

[Moderator] 14:09:19
Yeah, that sounds like it must have. Been a difficult time and did you mentioned did I hear correctly the bad outweigh the good or was it?

[P4] 14:09:28
Yeah, yeah, I think so. Yeah.

[Moderator] 14:09:29
Yeah.

[Moderator] 14:09:31
No. Yeah, I hear that must have been a really difficult time. Yeah, thank you.

[P4] 14:09:39
Yeah, the first year for me was pretty good, but then that first year, you know, included basic training, it included tech school.

[P4] 14:09:50
It included learning my job. And. So the first year was, really good. But things went downhill pretty quickly.

[P4] 14:10:02
From there on.

[Moderator] 14:10:04
And what your did you finish your service in the military?

[P4] 14:10:08
And 1991.

[Moderator] 14:10:09
1981. And you served from one to one roughly?

[P4] 14:10:14
1987 to 1991.

[Moderator] 14:10:22
Thank you. For sharing your experiences and. Your experience in the Air Force and the military.

[Moderator] 14:10:32
So in this next part of the interview, we're going to share a digital experience we've created and ask for your feedback.

[Moderator] 14:10:42
A few things I want you to know, you'll be interacting with a prototype that will not work.

[Moderator] 14:10:47
Exactly the way you expect. Meaning that some areas of the prototype will be clickable and some will not.

[P4] 14:10:49
Hmm.

[Moderator] 14:10:55
Some areas will be pre filled with fake information. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

[Moderator] 14:11:07
Also want you to know that in this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback about the quality of your experience filling out this form if you were to fill it out.

[P4] 14:11:16
Okay.

[Moderator] 14:11:16
Please comment on anything that is clear or anything that is unclear. And before I share the demo, I also wanted to ask.

[P4] 14:11:20
Okay.

[Moderator] 14:11:24
What has been your most recent experience with VA co-pay debt? Be a medical debt.

[P4] 14:11:34
Trying to get this kidney. Stuff paid for. It's been really hard to try to.

[P4] 14:11:44
To navigate it. I don't have, I don't have anything in front of me that.

[P4] 14:11:51
That helps me I'm supposed to talk to a social worker, social worker doesn't know very much.

[P4] 14:12:00
I'm supposed to talk to my primary care provider. She doesn't know very much.

[P4] 14:12:03
And so I'm spending a lot of my time trying to get this. Trying to get people to understand or get people on board with me in order to be able to pay.

[P4] 14:12:14
For kidney dialysis and it's something that the VA says, you know, everything that I've read says that they're supposed to do this for me that, you know, I'm eligible for it.

[P4] 14:12:25
But things keep coming up like different medications that I have to pay for. Different appointments.

[P4] 14:12:36
It's all kidney dialysis, but they're different parts of it. So it's trying to get the VA to pay for all the different parts because I don't know.

[Moderator] 14:12:47
Yeah, sounds like that must be really time consuming and also frustrating, it sounds like.

[P4] 14:12:51
It is. Yeah, it is. Yeah.

[Moderator] 14:12:57
I hope that there will be a resolution soon and that will be able to. Receive the care that you need.

[P4] 14:13:00
Thank you, I do too.

[P4] 14:13:05
Yeah.

[Moderator] 14:13:06
Thank you for sharing your experience. So now I'm going to share a link in the Zoom chat.

[Moderator] 14:13:13

[P4] 14:13:14
Okay.

[P4] 14:13:21

[Moderator] 14:13:28
Drop a link in the chat and just a moment.

[P4] 14:13:37
Okay.

[Moderator] 14:13:39
And whenever you see it, please click on the link. It will probably take you out of the zoom.

[Moderator] 14:13:46
Screen but I will still be able to hear you and I will help you navigate back to to the zoom

[P4] 14:13:54
Okay, I just saw something pop up that said Moderator did something and it looked like a link and then it was gone.

[Moderator] 14:14:02
It was gone. Let me see if I can help you with that. I have some mobile sharing directions.

[P4] 14:14:03
Yeah.

[Moderator] 14:14:11
To walk you through. Are you on an iPhone or in Android today? Okay, so.

[P4] 14:14:16
IPhone.

[Moderator] 14:14:25
And you're still in the Zoom right now. Yes. So You'll see a few buttons at the bottom of your screen.

[P4] 14:14:27
Yes.

[Moderator] 14:14:35
If you don't see them, you can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show.

[Moderator] 14:14:41
And once you see the buttons, there should be like a mute stop video share participants and then there's on the right hand side there are 3 if you click on the dots, you should see the chat.

[P4] 14:14:42
Okay.

[P4] 14:14:47
Yeah.

[P4] 14:15:03
Yeah, it says meeting settings, background benefits, disconnect audio. That's what I see.

[Moderator] 14:15:13
Let's see.

[Moderator] 14:15:17
Let me try sending it in the chat one more time. To see if you get a notification.

[P4] 14:15:21
Okay.

[P4] 14:15:27
Okay. Okay, it says you're chatting as a guest. Let's just send here also one new message.

[Moderator] 14:16:03
Correct. Yes, that's the right link.

[Moderator] 14:16:09
And it might take a moment to load.

[P4] 14:16:18
I see the. Official website of the United States government talked to the veterans crisis line now. Sign in.

[P4] 14:16:29
Oh, is this the form I need? The form is for veterans or service members who need help with that related.

[Moderator] 14:16:36
That's the right link. Yes, awesome. So now a little bit tricky, I'll need you to, navigate back to the zoom.

[P4] 14:16:37
Okay.

[Moderator] 14:16:45
Zoom window so i think that if you Tap. On your phone you should see the zoom icon again

[Moderator] 14:16:57
Let me know if that works.

[P4] 14:17:03
Hmm.

[P4] 14:17:10
Okay.

[P4] 14:17:14
No. Kinda. Lost here.

[Moderator] 14:17:20
I'm sorry about that. Seeing how I can, Help you navigate back.

[Moderator] 14:17:37
Let me see if I can ask, someone on my team to help us with the navigating back to.

[Moderator] 14:17:45
To Zoom.

[P4] 14:17:52
Yeah, cause all I see is,

[P4] 14:17:57
The link.

[Moderator] 14:18:00
So. Someone just said that if you swipe from the bottom of the screen. To up to open up.

[Moderator] 14:18:10
Multitasking windows, you should see the zoom window. Let me know if that works.

[P4] 14:18:16
Okay, I see them. I swiped up and I can see the.

[P4] 14:18:26
My home screen. And I'm looking for Zoom. I don't see it.

[Moderator] 14:18:33
You don't see it on your, maybe on your iPhone Home screen.

[P4] 14:18:38
No, I don't see. I don't see the app for it.

[Moderator] 14:18:46
The zoom window should be on the left of the screen.

[Moderator] 14:18:53
Thank you for your patience. I'm really sorry. It's always a bit tricky to.

[Moderator] 14:18:58
To navigate the technical issues.

[P4] 14:19:02
When I click on the, quick back on the phone, I still messages address the meeting group. I still see this.

[P4] 14:19:17
I still see this, VA page. And then what I. Go back, I see the.

[P4] 14:19:28
The link. To the page.

[Moderator] 14:19:36
What is, let's see, I look at my phone.

[Moderator] 14:19:43
So. Hmm. That's tricky.

[P4] 14:19:47
Okay.

[Moderator] 14:19:52
If this doesn't work.

[P4] 14:19:52
I know that you're somewhere Zoom somewhere, but I don't.

[Moderator] 14:20:00
Yeah, these technical issues are always so checking. Oh, did you? You found it? Oh, awesome.

[P4] 14:20:02
There you go. Gotcha. Sorry about that.

[Moderator] 14:20:07
How did, how did you do it? Oh no, I'm sorry. Nope, no problem.

[Moderator] 14:20:13
This is always tricky.

[P4] 14:20:15
I can't tell you. I started. Kushim, you know, touching the screen and there you are.

[Moderator] 14:20:21
Awesome. Well, glad we're back. So in the next step, I will ask you to share a screen.

[P4] 14:20:22
I don't know.

[P4] 14:20:24
Yeah.

[Moderator] 14:20:30
So the way to do that is, you can see on the bottom of this window where I'm speaking right now.

[Moderator] 14:20:38
There's a button that's screen that says share screen.

[Moderator] 14:20:42
Do you see that?

[P4] 14:20:46
No.

[Moderator] 14:20:46
And if you don't see it, you should, try tapping on the window and it'll


[Moderator] 14:20:53
Pop up.

[P4] 14:20:55
Start video chat. Okay, share.

[Moderator] 14:21:00
Sure and then in the share options you should see either the Chrome or the Safari. Link that you just opened.

[Moderator] 14:21:10
And that's what, I'd like you to share.

[P4] 14:21:20
Okay, when I do this show, like this says screen photos, icloud, dropbox. Microsoft Onedrive, Sharepoint, Google Drive, Box website, URL.

[P4] 14:21:33
Is that what it is?

[Moderator] 14:21:33
I think it's website URL, yes.

[P4] 14:21:35
Website URL, input the URL and press share to let everyone see it.

[Moderator] 14:21:41
Oh, maybe it's not that one.

[P4] 14:21:43
I don't know what they URL is. Cancel.

[Moderator] 14:21:48
Do you see anything with, Chrome or Safari?

[P4] 14:21:58
Okay, at the bottom, you mean the bottom of the screen with the buttons? When I put, what I did share.

[Moderator] 14:22:04
So in Yep, in the same place you were in where you where you clicked on share screen.

[Moderator] 14:22:14
There should be the The page that you saw before. That's called UX. That Okay.

[P4] 14:22:25
Yeah, I remember. Nope.

[P4] 14:22:31
That's not it.

[P4] 14:22:35
Oh.

[Moderator] 14:22:40
So sorry about that. It might be the first option that you see.

[Moderator] 14:22:49
It should be screen.

[P4] 14:22:53
Okay.

[P4] 14:23:01
Screen. Yeah, I clicked that and it has Zoom, a check mark by Zoom. It just tells me that everything on your screen including notifications will be recorded.

[Moderator] 14:23:15
So I think what I'll do, I'll share my screen and take you through, the prototype.

[P4] 14:23:16
Start project.

[Moderator] 14:23:21
Or the demo. Are you still in this zoom? Can you see me?

[P4] 14:23:27
I can see you, yeah.

[Moderator] 14:23:28
Okay, perfect. So I'm going to open a window with the link. And I'll take you through.

[Moderator] 14:23:36
The experience.

[P4] 14:23:52
What it possible to do it from my computer? Like have the phone on and then do the URL for my computer, the website for my computer.

[Moderator] 14:24:03
I think it would require that you rejoin the zoom. I was wondering when you were sharing when you clicked on share screen, did you see start broadcast?

[P4] 14:24:06
Okay.

[P4] 14:24:15
Hmm.

[Moderator] 14:24:16
Thank you, we might try one last time.

[P4] 14:24:18
Okay. Okay, go to share. Okay.

[Moderator] 14:24:24
Share screen in the green button.

[P4] 14:24:29
No, there's

[P4] 14:24:33
Okay, there's not a green button. It just has words that are listed in a row and it has screen photos.

[P4] 14:24:41
I crowd drive, dropbox, one drive Sharepoint. Google, Box, and Website URL.

[Moderator] 14:24:51
I wonder if it might be Google. If that's

[P4] 14:24:53
Google.

[P4] 14:24:58
Google tastes me to Zoom to sign in.

[Moderator] 14:25:02
Hmm.

[Moderator] 14:25:09
Yeah, I'll try sharing my screen. Let me know if you can. See my screen.

[P4] 14:25:18
Yeah, I can see your screen.

[Moderator] 14:25:21
Are you able to read, what's on the screen? It might be a bit small, but.

[P4] 14:25:27
Yeah, I was able to make it larger. You're smaller, but that's okay. You're still there.

[P4] 14:25:32
And yeah, I can see it.

[Moderator] 14:25:32
Yeah. Great, actually, let me try. I need to re-share.

[Moderator] 14:25:49
Okay.

[Moderator] 14:26:22
Okay, great. So we're here. So imagine you navigated to this page because you want help with your VA.

[Moderator] 14:26:33
I'm going to take you through the first few sections and I will ask you some follow-up questions. And I will, ask you some follow-up questions.

[Moderator] 14:26:42
So, when we're on a screen, just please, Just take a look and read.

[Moderator] 14:26:48
And let me know if anything is clear or unclear. So I'll try to go slowly as I take you through.

[Moderator] 14:26:55
These sections.

[Moderator] 14:27:01
And please remember to think out loud and let me know what stands out and what is clear and clear.

[P4] 14:27:09
Okay, so this request help with that this VA form. 5655.

[P4] 14:27:17
This is our request to get help with. What's the step? Healthcare co-pays.

[Moderator] 14:27:22
Yeah.

[P4] 14:27:27
Okay. What do you want to do with this debt?

[P4] 14:27:37
Okay.

[P4] 14:27:45
Okay.

[Moderator] 14:27:46
And where would you click next?

[P4] 14:27:52
Be healthcare, request that relief waiver. Definitely online. And then submit a.

[Moderator] 14:27:59
Okay.

[P4] 14:28:03
Support. Submit a financial status report.

[Moderator] 14:28:07
Okay.

[P4] 14:28:09
Okay, since she signed in here.

[P4] 14:28:14
Then you would start request now follow these steps to help. If you don't think the right form for you, go back.

[Moderator] 14:28:20
And

[P4] 14:28:24
Okay. Ma'am. You don't think this is the right form for you to go back and answer questions again.

[Moderator] 14:28:26
Yes.

[P4] 14:28:33
Okay.

[Moderator] 14:28:37
And so if you wanted to fill out this form to help with your the copay debt. Would you take the time to read this introduction page or would you just start the request now?

[P4] 14:28:49
Well. At first I would have said I would start the request now. But then I saw.

[P4] 14:28:57
Number one prepare I saw work history for the past 2 years. Now, I realize that this is something that I need to go through.

[Moderator] 14:29:08
Right.

[P4] 14:29:09
I would need to go through this. Number one, where it says prepare. I would actually need to read that.

[Moderator] 14:29:15
Okay.

[P4] 14:29:16
Because

[P4] 14:29:20
Is asking for information that I wouldn't know off the top of my head.

[P4] 14:29:27
So if I click that, I would have had to go back and then read all of this.

[Moderator] 14:29:32
Right, right, it has that. Preparation.

[P4] 14:29:36
Yeah.

[P4] 14:29:40
Yeah, so I would have had 2.

[P4] 14:29:43
Have done this. To submit your request. So, 16. Okay, will you go up?

[P4] 14:29:53
I mean down, I'm sorry.

[Moderator] 14:29:55
Okay.

[P4] 14:29:57
Submit your request.

[P4] 14:30:00
She's gonna follow up.

[P4] 14:30:07
Okay, now start your request. Okay. Yeah, I would have had to read all of it. Yeah.

[Moderator] 14:30:14
And why is that?

[P4] 14:30:16
Because because I would have been totally lost if I had started the request at, at the top of this.

[P4] 14:30:26
Where it said start request. Like I said, it just happened to catch my eye where I saw.

[P4] 14:30:32
Work history. And so then I would have gone ahead and gone through the the preparations so that I could see exactly what I needed.

[P4] 14:30:44
And then I would have gone through the entire thing. And then at the bottom of that, it says again, start to request now.

[P4] 14:30:53
That's when I would have started the request.

[P4] 14:30:55
Am I making sense?

[Moderator] 14:30:55
Thanks for your. Yes, you are. Thanks for your feedback. This is really great feedback.

[Moderator] 14:31:02
So let me know when you want me to click on start your requests now.

[P4] 14:31:05

[Moderator] 14:31:07
Okay.

[P4] 14:31:11
27.

[P4] 14:31:14
Okay. Continue.

[Moderator] 14:31:17
And so this is the part of the form where some fake information has been. Filled out. So in veteran of the form where some fake information has been filled out, so in veteran information, it's someone else's, fake name.

[P4] 14:31:23
Yeah.

[P4] 14:31:27
Yeah.

[P4] 14:31:38
How does this know? Which that it is that you need help with.

[Moderator] 14:31:47
Hmm.

[P4] 14:31:48
You're home saying it's got $345 co pay bill. And then it's got the $20 would that already be pre-filled so that you wouldn't know what the debts are that the VA has for you.

[Moderator] 14:31:59
Does that seem unusual? Is that something you haven't seen before on?

[P4] 14:32:04
I haven't, no. - no.

[Moderator] 14:32:05
Yeah. Yeah, great question. So now, we're able to, to notify you of the debt that you have on the that portal.

[P4] 14:33:20
Oh.

[P4] 14:33:27
I forgot you didn't know if I was married or not. No, I'm not married.

[Moderator] 14:33:30

Is rental is this rental income is that rental assistance is that the same thing? What is rental income?

[Moderator] 14:34:57
Hmm. That's a great question and I can see how that's a little bit ambiguous. Yeah.

[P4] 14:35:05
Yeah, like is somebody paying for it or what? Okay, well. That would be it.

[P4] 14:35:15
So I guess we'll continue.

[P4] 14:35:21
Income. How much is your monthly income for each source? Investment income. 0.

[P4] 14:35:29
Employment bonus, 0.

[Moderator] 14:35:32
So here you can imagine it would reflect the selections you made before, but due to the limitation of this demo.

[Moderator] 14:35:38
We've pre selected these 2 options investment in common but employment both

[P4] 14:35:43
Okay, to the other income.

[Moderator] 14:35:48
That's right.

[P4] 14:35:49
Okay, your other income. Yeah.

[P4] 14:35:56
So what I have the option of deleting those if they didn't. Apply to me. Okay.

[Moderator] 14:36:01
Yes, yes, you would. So all of these. Links would be, would be possible to click on and, would be responsive.

[Moderator] 14:36:11
But due to this being a kind of just an early prototype or demo it's not fully functional.

[P4] 14:36:19
Gotcha. Okay.

[Moderator] 14:36:22
I know that's a little bit confusing.

[P4] 14:36:27
Has your spouse had any jobs in the last 2 years? That would be no since there's no spouse.

[P4] 14:36:36
Hmm.

[P4] 14:36:46
Spasses other income. Nay, no spouse.

[P4] 14:36:55
This is pretty easy for me.

[Moderator] 14:36:58
You would be able to skip certain sections.

[P4] 14:36:58
Okay.

[Moderator] 14:37:07
Alright.

[P4] 14:37:08
Okay, cash on hands. Not in a bank. You currently have.

[P4] 14:37:19
80 bucks.

[Moderator] 14:37:22
And what does cash on hand mean to you when you read cash on hand? What does that mean?

[P4] 14:37:26
Would usually I mean the reason I said that not in a bank is because usually like here, like, here where, I have my apartment where I rent, cash on hand is usually how much you have left over.

[P4] 14:37:46
After you've paid your bills. So that's what they, that's the way they explain it anyway, cash on hand.

[P4] 14:37:54
But this specifically says not in a bank. So to me, that means money that I can put my hands on right now.

[P4] 14:38:05
So I can put my hands on $80 right now. If I didn't have that $80, it would be 0, but I can't put my hands on $80.

[Moderator] 14:38:08
Okay.

[P4] 14:38:15
If it was worded differently. To reflect what you would have left over after all your bills were paid then that would be a different amount.

[P4] 14:38:27
Does that make sense?

[Moderator] 14:38:27
Thanks. Yes, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you for that feedback and generally do you happen to know off the top of your head the cash on hands that you have?

[P4] 14:38:43
You mean from month to month how much I would, I keep up with that if I keep up with it?

[P4] 14:38:51
Is that what you're asking? Yes, I do.

[Moderator] 14:38:51
Yes, right. Okay.

[P4] 14:38:59
Okay, you can skip questions on this form. Switch we need to do.

[P4] 14:39:08
Okay.

[Moderator] 14:39:10
What is this page mean to you?

[P4] 14:39:13
It means that I have.

[P4] 14:39:20
That now I'm ready to submit the application. I need to review it. I need to make sure that it's all.

[P4] 14:39:27
Correct to the best of my knowledge and then I can submit the application.

[Moderator] 14:39:33
Okay. Thanks.

[Moderator] 14:39:36
Let me know. When you'd like me to click continue.

[P4] 14:39:41
Just one.

[P4] 14:39:46
What does it mean you'll be eligible for a waiver? I don't I've probably read through or didn't read very well what a waiver is.

[P4] 14:39:57
Was that for for the co-pays for the bills?

[Moderator] 14:40:02
Right, does it seem like it's for the copays or the bills based on what you've read so far?

[P4] 14:40:08
Very on your response so far.

[P4] 14:40:16
Yeah, it's

[P4] 14:40:19
It sounds like it's telling me that based on my responses that I'm gonna be eligible for a waiver to get the bills taken care of.

[P4] 14:40:31
It's telling me right now that I am eligible for a waiver. So now I'm happy.

[Moderator] 14:40:38
Yeah. Okay.

[P4] 14:40:39
So now I'm gonna submit. I'll continue. Yeah.

[P4] 14:40:47
Step 7, review information.

[P4] 14:40:53
Tuesday. Click on each of the sections above to review the information.

[P4] 14:41:03
Okay, this is all the information that was. And for Hector. Okay. Yeah

[Moderator] 14:41:08
And here you can imagine it would be your information that you've.

[P4] 14:41:15
I gotcha and household income should be the same.

[Moderator] 14:41:20
Correct, yes.

[P4] 14:41:22
An assets the same. Okay.

[P4] 14:41:33
Did I review my bank website history?

[Moderator] 14:41:37
Oh. That actually, no you didn't. So that section was not there that.

[P4] 14:41:47
Okay, okay, just.

[Moderator] 14:41:47
That is a demo. Mistake. Er, that should be there. Good catch.

[P4] 14:41:51
Okay.

[P4] 14:41:54
Okay, so then I would electronically sign my name.

[P4] 14:42:01
Okay. Gotcha. Read and accepted.

[Moderator] 14:42:11
How do you feel about this page overall?

[P4] 14:42:22
It's simple, which I like. It's easy.

[P4] 14:42:28
Yeah, it's simple.

[Moderator] 14:42:32
And that can be anything about like how clear and clear it is or if the The language makes sense.

[P4] 14:42:41
No, it is clear. That's what I like about it is that it is. Is that it's simple, it's to the point.

[Moderator] 14:42:55
And let me know when you'd like to go to the next screen.

[P4] 14:42:59
Okay, let's yeah, let's go to the next screen.

[P4] 14:43:04
And your request. You're also before waver.

[P4] 14:43:12
Awesome. Okay, here's what you can expect from our final review. Okay, let's go.

[P4] 14:43:21
Okay, hold on.

[P4] 14:43:32
Okay, so maybe it's me.

[P4] 14:43:37
It tells me that I. Am eligible for a waver. What does that say about the waver?

[Moderator] 14:43:45
No.

[P4] 14:43:46
I need to see it. Okay, you're eligible for a waiver and then it tells me

[P4] 14:43:53
Is this thing that the waiver is that they will forgive part or all of the unpaid debt? Is that what the waiver is?

[P4] 14:44:03
We'll review any payments you have already made. To pay down the debt. I'm confused about.

[P4] 14:44:11
The green check mark seems like it's a good thing. You're eligible for a waiver, but then when I read, here's what to expect.

[P4] 14:44:20
It doesn't sound like it's such a good thing. You see what I'm saying?

[Moderator] 14:44:24
Yes.

[P4] 14:44:25
It's like it's still there's, still some decisions to be made.

[Moderator] 14:44:31
Hmm. Yeah, I hear you saying that the the green checkmark feels positive and yet. What's written here doesn't necessarily align with that.

[P4] 14:44:43
Exactly. Exactly. Yeah.

[Moderator] 14:44:46
What would you have expected to see instead of a check mark?

[Moderator] 14:44:52
If anything.

[P4] 14:44:54
Hmm.

[P4] 14:45:00
Still something, that's not, that doesn't seem so definite. The green check mark with the words you're eligible for a waiver.

[P4] 14:45:08
So seems. Seems really positive, seems definite. It should be something that, lets me know that I'm almost there.

[P4] 14:45:24
That there that there might need to be another step.

[P4] 14:45:29
Something in between.

[P4] 14:45:33
You're eligible for a waiver, but something that makes more sense to where it gets down to will for you part of all the unpaid debt.

[P4] 14:45:42
Somewhere in between there. So I think the green check mark is throwing me off.

[Moderator] 14:45:48
Yep, I can see that.

[P4] 14:45:50
So it needs to be more of a possibility. Instead of a definite because when you say you're eligible to me that's definite.

[P4] 14:45:59
But then the will forgive part.

[P4] 14:46:04
Doesn't seem like it's such a good thing. I'm not explaining myself very well.

[Moderator] 14:46:09
Oh, you are. I completely understand. And how would you feel if instead of your eligible for a waiver, if it just said, We'll review, we'll review your request and get back to you.

[P4] 14:46:21
I like that. Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking. Along those lines, it's just say something like that instead of you are eligible for a waiver.

[Moderator] 14:46:30
Okay. And then third option, what if it said, you have received the waiver?

[P4] 14:46:44
Not if this bottom part is still there.

[Moderator] 14:46:49
Oh, right. So imagining that it would not say the bottom part, it would say, you, have received a waiver and your debt has been forgiven.

[P4] 14:47:00
Okay, that'll work.

[P4] 14:47:07
That'll work, but if it isn't, if it isn't, if I don't know right now that it isn't forgiven.

[P4] 14:47:14
And these 2 statements need to stay there, then the. The section in the green needs to reflect what the bottom is saying.

[Moderator] 14:47:27
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

[Moderator] 14:47:31
And what specifically about the bottom part? Feels not as. As good or as positive.

[P4] 14:47:43
I'm requesting a waiver. And it tells me that.

[P4] 14:47:52
It tells me that will forgive part. Or all of your unpaid debt. So I know that I might get part of it or all of it paid.

[P4] 14:48:04
I get that. We'll review any payments you have already made. To pay down this that in some cases we may pay you back.

[P4] 14:48:13
Certain amounts. It is unclear. For example, when. I got student loan debt forgiveness.

[P4] 14:48:24
And I filled out something similar to this. It told me that.

[P4] 14:48:32
That I was eligible. And it told me that. That I was going to get the waver.

[P4] 14:48:42
And where it says will repay, it says that.

[P4] 14:48:50
I would receive the payments that I had already made.

[P4] 14:48:55
See what I'm saying? It was, it looked like this, but it told me that. I was eligible to receive the, to be a part of the program.

[Moderator] 14:48:57
Hmm.

[P4] 14:49:07
It told me that.

[P4] 14:49:14
They would forgive the debt. Not part of it. There were more definites about that. It was definitely we will forgive the debt.

[Moderator] 14:49:19
Hmm.

[P4] 14:49:28
You qualify so we're going to forgive the debt. You qualify and you will receive the payments that you've already made that.

[Moderator] 14:49:37
I see. And how does it feel if Part of the debt is forgiven, but not all of it.

[P4] 14:49:47
That would be a good thing too. One I filled out the application and know that somebody's reviewed it and know that I will get part of it back.

[P4] 14:49:58
That's good. That would be good for me also. But I just needed to say that I'm eligible for a partial waiver.

[Moderator] 14:50:09
A partial waiver. Okay.

[P4] 14:50:11
And not a waver. So if I'm gonna get partial help, if I'm gonna get forgiveness on part of it, then I need that to say.

[P4] 14:50:21
Partial or part.

[Moderator] 14:50:24
Thank you for your feedback. My last question on this page is, Does your eligible for a waiver?

[Moderator] 14:50:33
How definite does that sound?

[P4] 14:50:37
To me it sounds very definite. In my mind it says you got it you are eligible for a waiver

[Moderator] 14:50:47
Okay, yep. Great. Thank you for your feedback. So now that we've gone through this, This, this, this form.

[Moderator] 14:51:00
What was your overall experience with the form like?

[P4] 14:51:08
After I've gone through it, it seems like it's, simple and it's, and it's easy to follow.

[P4] 14:51:14
If I had not taken the time like something slipped by me so I was kind of going through it too quickly.

[P4] 14:51:22
But if some things had slipped past me, I would have just been all over the place with it, having to go back and read and figure out what it meant.

[Moderator] 14:51:29
Hmm.

[P4] 14:51:34
But I think if. I take my time the way people should do on these types of things. Then it wouldn't have been so difficult to follow.

[P4] 14:51:47
I think it would have been really easy. You know, like at the beginning when I told you that I need to go back to and read that because I went past it so fast.

[P4] 14:51:58
Where it said, I'll go ahead and click to, to start.

[Moderator] 14:52:02
Right, right.

[P4] 14:52:04
Yeah, when I. I would have, ordinarily just done that, but then something caught my eye below it and it's a good thing that it was there because that I was able to see it because then I was able to say, oh no, I better go ahead and go through these steps of what this is.

[P4] 14:52:21
Because it was something about my years of work history or something like that. And then I would have had to go back anyway.

[Moderator] 14:52:29
Yeah.

[P4] 14:52:30
So yeah, I think that it was it was easy to navigate, especially being able to see further down the page. You know what I'm saying?

[P4] 14:52:40
Could it just be that little block? I would have messed myself up because I wouldn't have been able to see, I had and I was able to see ahead.

[P4] 14:52:50
So I like that.

[Moderator] 14:52:51
Absolutely, great feedback. And speaking of that important page, the intro page. I wanted to revisit it in the last few minutes of our time together today.

[Moderator] 14:53:03
To show you, so this is how it is, right now with. The steps and the information and what you need to provide.

[P4] 14:53:07
Yeah.

[Moderator] 14:53:12
And why we ask for the information and then. The process. And we're thinking about another version of this page.

[Moderator] 14:53:22
Which is this one where it has less. Detail. And I wanted to ask you between the 2 versions.

[Moderator] 14:53:34
Which one? Would you be most likely to read? And why.

[P4] 14:53:42
This one, already see. Yeah. So when, the, last one when I was, when I was reading it and I told you that I happen to see that work history part.

[P4] 14:53:55
That was the thing that made me go back and yeah, that was the thing that made me go back and, decide that I needed to go ahead and do this preparation.

[P4] 14:54:05
On the second screen that you showed me. It's all right there. Everything is right there. And that's even better.

[P4] 14:54:16
That would help me even better because I would I would see that and automatically know. Everything that I would need and not have to take so much time to read.

[Moderator] 14:54:27
Okay, that makes sense. So in this first version, you have to go through the whole page to see everything.

[P4] 14:54:31
Yeah. Yeah, you, yeah, you do. But the good thing about this page about that first page was that when you see the, the prepare and then right under that you see the work history.

[P4] 14:54:48
So that lets you know that you're gonna need some things and you probably need to go ahead and read.

[P4] 14:54:53
But this is a lot. This is a lot better. It's all just right there, really concise and I like that.

[P4] 14:55:01
You can see it all, everything.

[Moderator] 14:55:02
So it sounds like this second version would be best for you.

[P4] 14:55:06
Yes, it would be best for me.

[Moderator] 14:55:10
Great. So I think that. All the questions I have for you today and.

[P4] 14:55:16
There you are.

[Moderator] 14:55:18
I was wondering if you have any questions for us or for me.

[P4] 14:55:22
Now, well, the only thing I want to know is if this is gonna be, this is, this is a test that for something that's gonna happen in the future possibly.

[P4] 14:55:32
Is that the case?

[Moderator] 14:55:32
We are working on, on this experience. There is currently, the form the financial status report form which is on VA.

[P4] 14:55:42
Huh.

[Moderator] 14:55:43
Gov. When you sign in and you go to the debt portal. You can also search for the form.

[Moderator] 14:55:53
It's called Financial Status Report Form. And you're able to fill it out if you would like help with either benefits over payment debt or copay debt.

[P4] 14:56:05
Yeah, yeah, I've done that and that was really confusing. I think I gave up after a little while.

[Moderator] 14:56:09
Oh. Oh, when was that?

[P4] 14:56:11
Yeah.

[P4] 14:56:14
This was just.

[Moderator] 14:56:14
We.

[P4] 14:56:17
Maybe a year and a half ago, I had a dead. Of The debt was over $500 but they reduced it.

[P4] 14:56:28
So I guess that was like they weighed part of it. I guess that's what that meant.

[P4] 14:56:33
But yeah, it was it was really hard to figure out and it took me going back to it and reading it and then going back again, you know, to.

[Moderator] 14:56:39
Hmm.

[P4] 14:56:41
To get the full gist of what I needed to do. It was complicated. That's why I was wondering if this is what's gonna be.

[P4] 14:56:49
Next.

[Moderator] 14:56:50
Yeah, I hear that. I do want you to know we did. Update the experience. So if you try it Today, there's a newer version of the form.

[P4] 14:57:00
Okay, good.

[Moderator] 14:57:00
So definitely encourage you if, it, if you need to, fill out the form to, try it again because there's a new.

[P4] 14:57:08
Okay.

[Moderator] 14:57:09
New a new kind of version of the form and then the one we're working on right now.

[P4] 14:57:13
Okay.

[Moderator] 14:57:16
It is being worked on and wil be releasing it in the next few months.

[P4] 14:57:23
Okay. Okay. Thank you.

[Moderator] 14:57:26
Yes, thank you so much for your time today. Really appreciate it. I just want to see if my team has any final questions just in this last minute or 2.

[Moderator] 14:57:41
Okay. And I just wanted to share the link with you to. The form.

[Moderator] 14:57:50
I'll share it in the chat and then

[P4] 14:57:55
Okay.

[Moderator] 14:57:55
And if you if you're not able to save it, I will see if. Perigean, who, you worked with to.

[Moderator] 14:58:03
Join this interview can send it to you by email.

[P4] 14:58:05
Okay.

[Moderator] 14:58:07
And we were wondering, did you end up submitting the form in the end when you tried it a year and a half ago.

[P4] 14:58:13
Yeah, I did. I don't think I submitted it online that I didn't submit it online.

[P4] 14:58:20
I printed it off. And Mel and yeah.

[Moderator] 14:58:23
You're printed. Okay, and how is that for you?

[P4] 14:58:28
I don't like doing things that way. I would prefer to have done it online, but it had just become so time consuming until it seemed easier to.

[Moderator] 14:58:30
Hmm.

[P4] 14:58:37
Send it in.

[Moderator] 14:58:38
Yeah, that makes sense. Well, thank you so much again for your time. I hope you have a good rest of your day and I really enjoyed our conversation today.

[P4] 14:58:48
Thank you. Thank you, appreciate it

[Moderator] 14:58:51
Thank you. Take care
