[Moderator] 12:02:47

[Moderator] 12:03:13
Oh, wow. Wow. Being in the Air Force. And, anything specific that stands out or just generally the whole experience.

[P1] 12:03:24

[Moderator] 12:03:27
Yeah, Thank you for sharing that.

[P1] 12:03:31
Yep.

[Moderator] 12:03:33
So now we'll launch into the. The, part of the interview about your experiences with debt.

[Moderator] 12:03:41
So today I'll be taking you through a form to help with VA copay debt.

[Moderator] 12:03:46
And firstly, I'd like, I'd like to briefly ask about your experiences with VA copays.

[Moderator] 12:03:53
What has been your most recent experience with VA copay debt?

[P1] 12:03:58
Oh, I haven't had any recent experience with no, not with copays yet.

[Moderator] 12:04:03
Okay. And anything maybe from the past. Not, recent, but maybe in the last couple of years or more.

[Moderator] 12:04:16
Okay. Any other types of VA that you've experienced?

[P1] 12:04:25
Hmm, housing. Where the VA help me.

[Moderator] 12:04:29
How's that?

[P1] 12:04:33
I was losing my house and a Yeah, rep with. Fannie May or? Something.

[P1] 12:04:45
Helped me be able to regain my house and prove that I could keep it. So out of nowhere somebody came in and.

[Moderator] 12:04:53
No.

[P1] 12:04:57
Helped me be able to. Save me from losing my house. That was during the housing crisis.

[Moderator] 12:05:02
Wow, well.

[Moderator] 12:05:06
What year was the housing prices and 2008. Yeah, well. That must have been a really difficult time and I'm happy to hear that there was a VA representative that was able to help.

[P1] 12:05:09
2008, 2009.

[P1] 12:05:23
Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:05:25
Thank you for sharing. Thank you for sharing that experience.

[P1] 12:05:26
Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:05:31
So today I'll be taking you through a form, to help with, a copay that, as I mentioned.

[P1] 12:05:39
Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:05:39
So I will be sharing a prototype or a demo and I want you to know that, this prototype may not work or will not work.

[Moderator] 12:05:50
Exactly as you expect. Some of the areas of the prototype will be clickable while some will not.

[Moderator] 12:05:57
Also when you're filling things out, some of the information will be reflected back, but not all of it.

[Moderator] 12:06:03
And I also want you to know that since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

[Moderator] 12:06:11
And yes.

[P1] 12:06:14
I did was recalling when I wasn't working, I did have a problem making my copays.

[P1] 12:06:20
Before I was a disabled.

[Moderator] 12:06:23
And this is.

[P1] 12:06:23
Yeah, now that I'm a disabled that I don't have any copays, but when.

[P1] 12:06:31
When I wasn't working, it was harder for me to make the co-pays.

[Moderator] 12:06:37
Yeah.

[P1] 12:06:37
So. That was probably 10 years ago. And so.

[P1] 12:06:46
I had to make incremental payments. I guess. Yeah. Good.

[Moderator] 12:06:49
The incremental payments. Okay.

[P1] 12:06:54
I would get notices that I was late.

[Moderator] 12:06:57
How would you get those notices? For the copay. And okay, Thank you for sharing that and I'm glad you remembered.

[P1] 12:07:01
In mail.

[P1] 12:07:06
Yeah. Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:07:09
That was, how long ago?

[P1] 12:07:12
2012.

[Moderator] 12:07:13
2012, okay, so about 10 years. And in the end, how is that resolved?

[P1] 12:07:15
Yeah.

[P1] 12:07:21
My wife finally got a job and we were able to make the payments.

[Moderator] 12:07:26
Thank you for sharing that.

[Moderator] 12:07:30
So, now I'm going to drop a link in the zoom chat and I just wanna ask, are you on desktop today or laptop?

[P1] 12:07:37
Yes.

[Moderator] 12:07:38
Okay, great. So I will. Drop the link in the chat in just a moment.

[P1] 12:07:46
Hmm.

[P1] 12:07:54
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:07:55
Great. And whenever you're ready, please open the link. And I will ask you to share your screen.

[P1] 12:08:04
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:08:11
In the Zoom, screen might disappear when you open the link so I can help you navigate back.

[P1] 12:08:17
Okay, so it says host disabled participant screen sharing.

[Moderator] 12:08:22
Oh. That's not. Good. And that's not how it should be.

[Moderator] 12:08:30
Let me see.

[Moderator] 12:08:33
Sorry about that. Let's see.

[P1] 12:08:35
Okay.

[P1] 12:08:44
Probably in the security.

[Moderator] 12:08:47
That's a good idea. I'm looking at the settings.

[Moderator] 12:08:57
See security.

[Moderator] 12:09:10
Let me reach out to my contact that can help with technical issues I apologize

[Moderator] 12:09:52
Okay, I think I figured it out. Could you please try it now?

[P1] 12:10:00
Yep.

[Moderator] 12:10:05
Oh, great. I'm glad it works. Thank you so much for your patience. I'm going to let our contact know that.

[Moderator] 12:10:12
Resolved.

[Moderator] 12:10:16
Okay. Great. So please click proceed.

[Moderator] 12:10:30
So just setting some context, we're going to take you through a form and ask you to fill it out as you would normally.

[Moderator] 12:10:38
And, Imagine that you navigated to this page because you want help with the copaid debt.

[Moderator] 12:10:47
I'm going to be observing silently during some sections. And I will also ask you certain questions at certain times.

[Moderator] 12:10:54
I will ask you to pause when I have follow up questions. You can also use. Take information for the form if you prefer.

[P1] 12:11:02
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:11:09
Just take a moment to look at this page and please. Comment on if anything is clear or unclear.

[P1] 12:11:18
No, it's clear.

[P1] 12:11:22
So then do you want me to submit a financial status report?

[Moderator] 12:11:26
Yes, please. Go ahead and click there.

[Moderator] 12:11:43
So I noticed that you, skipped the previous page. And I was wondering, why that is.

[P1] 12:11:51
Oh.

[P1] 12:11:56
Just because it says start your request now before asks you to read all this stuff.

[Moderator] 12:12:03
Thanks for putting that out. That makes sense. And

[P1] 12:12:09
It's also at the bottom. 2 spots, so I would take the one at the top off.

[Moderator] 12:12:12
Hi.

[P1] 12:12:17
Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:12:19
And if you were filling out this form, you would have, do you imagine you would have maybe most likely skipped this intro page and just clicked directly on, start your request now.

[P1] 12:12:32
Yes.

[P1] 12:12:35
That wasn't there. I would have gone through all of this.

[Moderator] 12:12:38
Okay, that makes sense. And now that we're on this page and just wondering what stands out to you most on this page.

[P1] 12:12:52
All these steps to request for help. So I would wanna, I would read all of this.

[P1] 12:12:59
First so that while I'm going through the Page. Well, contacting my VSO officer.

[P1] 12:13:15
Hmm

[P1] 12:13:18
To request for help.

[P1] 12:13:22
If you need help. So.

[P1] 12:13:34
Just curious why that wouldn't be up here. First. If you need help with your request, contact your VSO, seems like that would be up at the top.

[Moderator] 12:13:38
Which section specific? The

[Moderator] 12:13:48
Hmm. And why do you think that should be at the top?

[P1] 12:13:55
Well, because sometimes elderly folks you know, the older boomers. Typically have a harder time with.

[P1] 12:14:05
Internet stuff. And so. Hello these steps to request help.

[P1] 12:14:16
And if you don't think this form for you is right, you Go back and answer the question again or contact your VSO officer.

[P1] 12:14:26
To get help. Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:14:27
That's great. That's great feedback. Is there anything else on this page that is clear or unclear?

[P1] 12:14:37
No, I like that you have why do we ask this information in blue? Because that's that direction to that.

[Moderator] 12:14:46
And how do you feel about what it says under why do we ask for this information?

[P1] 12:14:47
Hmm.

[P1] 12:14:56
You need to know where all the, you know, what all your financial

[P1] 12:15:02
Income is so that you know whether you can or can't make the payment.

[P1] 12:15:08
I mean, that's fair. So that. You know that there's no. You wanna know that the reasons the request is.

[Moderator] 12:15:10
Yeah.

[P1] 12:15:19
Being put in as legitimate. Which you know is fair.

[Moderator] 12:15:23
Hey.

[P1] 12:15:27
Hmm.

[P1] 12:15:30
It's the same as putting in a disability request. Really?

[Moderator] 12:15:36
Have you, have you gone through that process already?

[P1] 12:15:39
Yeah, I'm 60% disabled, so yeah. Hmm. Yep, okay.

[Moderator] 12:15:49
Whenever you're ready, please, click on start your request to know.

[P1] 12:15:53
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:15:56
So in the next few sections, Please let me know if anything seems clear or unclear. I'm mostly going to be observing and asking follow-up questions.

[Moderator] 12:16:15
And you can imagine that this would say your information. We had to use a fake name.

[P1] 12:16:18
Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:17:01
Unfortunately, that field is not. Clickable.

[P1] 12:17:04
Okay. I was curious.

[P1] 12:17:41
That's where you would do it. I'm not able to do it, but.

[Moderator] 12:17:44
That, yeah, sorry about that. Field is also not, interactive.

[P1] 12:17:46
No, That's all.

[P1] 12:17:59
So.

[P1] 12:18:07
So it says if you want to change your address or, oh, for other, benefits go to your, but for this you can edit it.

[P1] 12:18:17
If you need to. Okay.

[Moderator] 12:18:18
Correct.

[Moderator] 12:20:06
Is one of the limitations of the prototype. Some areas are going to be reflected back that you fill out and some will not.

[P1] 12:20:13
Okay. Cool.

[Moderator] 12:20:18
How are you feeling at this point in the form?

[P1] 12:20:20
Oh good. I mean, it's pretty simple.

[P1] 12:20:30
I don't have any questions.

[P1] 12:20:33
Good morning.

[P1] 12:20:42
I don't have any of these. So there should be a box that says none.

[Moderator] 12:20:50
Yeah. That's a good. Good idea.

[Moderator] 12:20:54
Good suggestion.

[P1] 12:21:00
Or, well, yeah.

[P1] 12:21:13
Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:21:37
Normally that delete button would be, would be clickable.

[P1] 12:21:39
You wouldn't work. Yeah. Okay. I don't have any additional.

[P1] 12:21:48
Let me go back. Oops.

[P1] 12:21:55
Okay. Try that again.

[P1] 12:22:02
Click too fast.

[Moderator] 12:22:04
That might actually, because of how we've set up the demo. Field has already been entered as that.

[P1] 12:22:13
Yeah. Yeah, I just wanted to see that page though.

[P1] 12:22:27
Hey, S.

[Moderator] 12:22:29
Is there something on that page that was? That's it out.

[P1] 12:22:34
No, I just, see if it had the boxes to add the. Yeah, the additional income just like.

[P1] 12:22:41
Adding your unemployment or whatever. And it, it was fine. Also, Hmm. Yes.

[P1] 12:22:58
That would be.

[P1] 12:23:13
Why would it ask if I currently look at this job?

[Moderator] 12:23:18
That's a great question. This is the spouses section. That might be a typo.

[P1] 12:23:21
Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:23:25
So because we created this prototype, because we're building the experience on the live environment.

[Moderator] 12:23:32
This has been. Done from scratch. So there are some, small, small mistakes here and there, but.

[P1] 12:23:36
Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:23:41
It would normally say, does your spouse currently work at this job? Sorry about that. That is confusing.

[P1] 12:23:45
Okay. Hmm. Yeah.

[P1] 12:23:55
Let's see. Good morning. No.

[Moderator] 12:24:49
Is this information you already know or would you?

[P1] 12:24:51
No, I'm just putting in some numbers because I don't really know them.

[P1] 12:25:07
Interesting. Doesn't let me continue here.

[Moderator] 12:25:13
Can you please try? The forward arrow on your keyboard and let's see if that works.

[P1] 12:25:20
Yup.

[Moderator] 12:25:30
That's not a clickable field. This could continue.

[P1] 12:25:36
It didn't work.

[P1] 12:25:41
Hmm.

[P1] 12:25:48
That one should have none also.

[Moderator] 12:25:57
It does seem like you can't advance unless there is a none option. It might, I can see, yeah, that.

[Moderator] 12:26:05
That being confusing.

[P1] 12:26:11
Yes. And you can't tab.

[P1] 12:26:16
To the next thing. So being able to tab would be great.

[Moderator] 12:26:20
Okay, that's really helpful.

[Moderator] 12:26:36
So on this question I wanted to ask you

[P1] 12:26:40
I'll go back. Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:26:42
What does, cash on hand mean to you?

[P1] 12:26:46
The amount of

[P1] 12:26:50
Gosh, I have my wallet.

[Moderator] 12:26:52
Okay, okay. And how do you feel about this question? Is it applicable to you?

[P1] 12:27:02
Well, it's still money that I have that I can use to pay a debt with.

[Moderator] 12:27:06
Okay. Yeah, I.

[P1] 12:27:08
And I mean, I think it's valuable if you have. If you have the resources to pay the debt, although.

[Moderator] 12:27:11
Excellent.

[P1] 12:27:20
Is that money used to buy food? I mean, I don't know.

[P1] 12:27:25
Yes, it's kind of an iffy question, but still it's a valid question.

[Moderator] 12:27:25
Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:27:33
And how come it's an if he question, can you say a little bit more about that?

[P1] 12:27:37
Well, what if they're using that money to buy food? Or you know to buy gas to get to work.

[Moderator] 12:27:45
Yeah.

[P1] 12:27:46
But you know it's still It's still like having money in the bank. Cash on hand.

[P1] 12:27:54
You're savings, I suppose.

[P1] 12:27:57
But to me, cash on hand means it's what you have that you can get your hands on.

[P1] 12:28:02
Right now.

[Moderator] 12:28:05
Right. I'm glad to hear that, phrase cache on hand is clear.

[Moderator] 12:28:11
We were trying to see if that would, if that makes sense. To, people if cash on hand.

[Moderator] 12:28:18
Word it that way makes sense and it sounds like that makes sense to you.

[P1] 12:28:22
Yeah, it's like what you got in your pocket. You might say cash in your pot if it's confusing, maybe cash in your pocket.

[Moderator] 12:28:31
And if you were filling this out, would you, how would you go about defining how much cash you have on hand.

[P1] 12:28:31
I know.

[P1] 12:28:42
Maybe what I have like my emergency cash in an envelope and what I have.

[P1] 12:28:53
In my lot.

[Moderator] 12:28:56
And are these, amounts that you know off the top of your head or would you estimate them or?

[P1] 12:29:03
It would. It's what I know off the top of my head.

[Moderator] 12:29:06
Okay. Thank you for your feedback on this question. Whenever. Oh.

[P1] 12:29:13
So yeah, does that include a debit card though? Because you can go get money out of the debit card.

[P1] 12:29:20
That's cash on hand. I mean.

[Moderator] 12:29:21
Hmm, okay, I see.

[P1] 12:29:23
That's still coming out of your bank. So I'm, you know. That hand.

[Moderator] 12:29:24
Yeah.

[P1] 12:29:30
If you have the younger generation. Who doesn't carry cash?

[Moderator] 12:29:37
Yeah, the question is. Like liquid cache that you have.

[Moderator] 12:29:42
In this moment. That's cash on hand so So we're trying to.

[P1] 12:29:47
Right. Right.

[Moderator] 12:29:51
Make this more precise and just It's a it's a bit challenging it for the reasons you mentioned.

[P1] 12:29:53
Right. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

[P1] 12:30:03
Right.

[P1] 12:30:07
You might put in parentheses maybe like. An example. Okay, cash in your wallet or something.

[Moderator] 12:30:16
Hmm, great idea. Noting that down.

[P1] 12:30:23
That might be helpful.

Will complete our final review.

[P1] 12:34:43
I would wanna know how they know I'm eligible for a

[Moderator] 12:34:48
Yeah. Why is it important to know if how they know. That you're eligible.

[P1] 12:34:59
Well,

[P1] 12:35:13
I don't, I guess because It's always been the case.

[Moderator] 12:35:20
That is explained.

[P1] 12:35:21
Yes. I'm not used to just being given something.

[P1] 12:35:26
Okay. So. As veterans, we've always had to.

[Moderator] 12:35:27
Yeah, that makes sense.

[P1] 12:35:38
Explain a way why we need something.

[P1] 12:35:42
So. It's just, I like. The idea is just a shock, I suppose.

[Moderator] 12:35:51
Yeah, that makes sense.

[P1] 12:35:52
And then, you know, it's not something you would normally see. It would, we would normally see what I'm explaining is.

[Moderator] 12:35:57
Hmm.

[P1] 12:36:02
We need to review this. Before we can tell you. Now, but it says you're eligible and we'll give you a final answer, which I guess is in sense the same thing.

[P1] 12:36:17
So.

[Moderator] 12:36:20
You mentioned it's a it's a shock. Can you say a little bit more about?

[P1] 12:36:23
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:36:26
A shock and what way like in the more positive sense or more negative sense.

[P1] 12:36:32
A positive sense.

[Moderator] 12:36:34
Okay.

[P1] 12:36:36
I feel like the, Veterans administration, I guess, is becoming a little more.

[P1] 12:36:48
Sensitive to.

[P1] 12:36:52
What the veterans need now.

[Moderator] 12:36:56
Yeah. That's really great to hear.

[P1] 12:37:00
It's taken a little while, but I mean at least it's coming.

[Moderator] 12:37:04
What are some other areas that you've noticed that, if you have any specific example?

[P1] 12:37:10
Well. You know, like the packed act. The military sexual trauma stuff.

[P1] 12:37:22
Just the facts that they recognize. Well, the whole health department. That whole thing.

[P1] 12:37:31
Where they're at. Hello. Us to have more of a say with our

[P1] 12:37:40
Or PCPs.

[Moderator] 12:37:43
Hmm. That's really, really great to hear.

[P1] 12:37:45
Yeah, not all of the PCPs are on board yet, but. We can get acupuncture for pain and instead of pills we can get massage or higher, you know.

[P1] 12:38:02
Different modalities now instead of being given a pill. Which is not.

[Moderator] 12:38:06
That's right. Really nice. Really positive.

[P1] 12:38:09
Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:38:11
Oh, thank you for your feedback. Any other, thoughts on this, page?

[P1] 12:38:31
So.

[P1] 12:38:40
Yeah, says we forget. Or olives. You asked

[P1] 12:38:49
And you won't have to pay the amount you forget and then they'll review the payments that we've made to pay down the debt.

[P1] 12:38:57
And in some cases. We may pay you back for certain And you don't have to do anything at this time.

[P1] 12:39:05
I'm curious, would there Yes. You have the money and you don't need to help.

[P1] 12:39:15
Would there be a different answer at the top?

[Moderator] 12:39:17
Great question. There would be, yes, it would, it's a personalized, process that through the questions that are asked on the form.

[Moderator] 12:39:27
So this is if you meet eligibility for the waiver. So depending on very unique.

[P1] 12:39:31
Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:39:36
Circumstances that are taken into account and in the questions that are asked on the forum.

[P1] 12:39:42
That's good to know. That's why I was wondering if there was a matrix. Behind all of that.

[Moderator] 12:39:48
Right, great question. Great question.

[P1] 12:39:52
And you can turn to. You can check your status. That's great.

[P1] 12:40:01
No.

[Moderator] 12:40:04
How do you feel about being able to print the the form and the page.

[P1] 12:40:09
I like it for just to have a receipt.

[P1] 12:40:17
Or even just create a PDF of it.

[Moderator] 12:40:23
Great. So I have a few post task questions, on this section before, the next section, which will be only about 10Â min.

[Moderator] 12:40:30
What was your overall experience with this form like?

[P1] 12:40:35
Good. I mean, it's very easy and straightforward. Just a few little, you know, hiccups here and there, but nothing.

[P1] 12:40:44
Nothing that really stood out.

[Moderator] 12:40:47
And what would you change if anything?

[P1] 12:40:52
Oh.

[Moderator] 12:40:59
It can be anything that you've seen.

[P1] 12:40:59
I don't.

[P1] 12:41:07
Well, I can't think of anything that looks.

[P1] 12:41:12
The format looks just like the rest of. The stuff which is good because And I'm thinking of people older than me.

[P1] 12:41:24
I would maybe make these color. This is

[P1] 12:41:31
For the older folks, so it stands out.

[Moderator] 12:41:35
Making. Great idea, and making some of the areas stand out more than others.

[P1] 12:41:35
Only.

[P1] 12:41:43
Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:41:50
So in this last section of the interview, we have just 2 pages we want to show you and kind of comparing contrast them.

[Moderator] 12:42:01
So if you use your keyboard arrow forward arrow key to go to the next page.

[Moderator] 12:42:08
So this is, the intro page we, saw in the beginning. Where it details all the sections you have to fill out and and the information you need to provide.

[P1] 12:42:14
Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:42:23
And then in the next page, there's another version of this introduction page. So if you click your arrow key again.

[Moderator] 12:42:32
It'll take you to the next. The next version, if you scroll down.

[Moderator] 12:42:41
And so the main difference here is that there's less text and there's less detail about the sections and what you need to provide.

[Moderator] 12:42:50
And so based on these 2 versions, Which one would you be most likely to read if you were?

[Moderator] 12:42:58
Seeing it at the beginning of the form as an introduction page.

[P1] 12:43:04
I'd be more likely to read this one.

[Moderator] 12:43:08
And why is that?

[P1] 12:43:10
Because you have

[P1] 12:43:13
Bold text. So it stands out. I mean, that's my income assets. It stands out.

[P1] 12:43:21
Additional assets. It's easier to see, easy to read. I don't have to go through.

[P1] 12:43:27
A whole paragraph. It's just, I, and I like, like that.

[P1] 12:43:32
There's no questions. It's very concise.

[Moderator] 12:43:33
Great.

[Moderator] 12:43:38
Great. And do you feel like the amount of information here to prepare you to fill out the form is enough?

[P1] 12:44:13
Hi, I do with. Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:44:19
And you can also if you'd like to use the back arrow you can see how this page is different from the other page.

[P1] 12:44:23
Yeah.

[P1] 12:44:44
Hmm

[P1] 12:44:51
You know, I'm gonna retract. I would read the second page. But. It doesn't have enough information about what you're seeking.

[P1] 12:45:05
In your work history. Like the employer name. Starting end date monthly.

[P1] 12:45:16
Like some people might not grab their W2 or. Or their paystub. You know what I mean?

[Moderator] 12:45:26
Which version do you think is the most useful and helpful?

[P1] 12:45:32
Probably the first one.

[Moderator] 12:45:34
So this page. Okay.

[P1] 12:45:36
Yeah. Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:45:42
Great. Great. Well, before I let you go, I'm gonna check to see if, my team has any additional questions.

[P1] 12:45:43
Yep.

[Moderator] 12:45:54
Just taking a look.

[Moderator] 12:46:03
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:46:17
So Observer1 has a question. I'm not sure I nderstand, Observer1, do you want to ask Lori the question?

[Moderator] 12:46:25
I'm not sure I understand. Based on.

[Observer1] 12:46:30
So earlier you had seen a transition page, where we let you know that you would be skipping questions. I was wondering if that was clear to you when you went to that section, it was right before the review page.

[P1] 12:46:48
No. It wasn't.

[Observer1] 12:46:52
Thanks.

[Moderator] 12:46:54
And we might have one more. Oh, okay. Looks like that is all the questions from our side. Do you have any questions for me before before we end the interview?

[P1] 12:47:12
No, I, no, that's well.

[P1] 12:47:18
I would think just, just suggesting the circles, the numbered circles, be the ones that you color.

[Moderator] 12:47:25
Right. And why is that?

[P1] 12:47:27
Like you have this just to. Drop people's attention.

[Moderator] 12:47:32
Okay, great. Great, that's a great idea. Well, I, sorry.

[P1] 12:47:38
You just. To the section.

[Moderator] 12:47:42
Yeah, just to draw your eye in a little bit. Great. Any other? Last.

[Moderator] 12:47:49
Thoughts or ideas?

[P1] 12:47:56
No.

[Moderator] 12:47:57
Okay. Well, I wanna say, Big thank you. Thank you so much for your time today and your feedback.

[Moderator] 12:48:03
We really, really appreciate it. It's going to be so helpful as we continue to work on this experience and make sure that it works for all veterans.

[Moderator] 12:48:13
Thank you again. I hope you have a great day. Take care. Bye

[P1] 12:48:14
Welcome. You too. Thanks
