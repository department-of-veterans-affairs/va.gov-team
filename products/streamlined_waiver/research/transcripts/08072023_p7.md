It was memorable. I didn't fight anybody. But.

[P7] 12:13:45
It was dramatic.

[Moderator] 12:13:49
I'm sorry to hear that. That sounds really, really difficult.

[P7] 12:13:52
It wasn't that bad, but it. Wasn't great either. So, you know, like I fell and I broke my ankle.

[P7] 12:14:01
And I was on crutches and I forgot my weapon and I had to go and stand before this.

[P7] 12:14:08
I'm a little tenant and I had to go and stand before this.

[P7] 12:14:12

[P7] 12:14:25
So, you know, it was like that. So, yeah.

[Moderator] 12:15:03
So we're going to be taking you through a form. That we're working on to help with VA copay debt.

[Moderator] 12:15:10
And first I'd like to briefly hear about your experiences with the copay debt if that applies to you.

[P7] 12:15:18
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:15:20
And the question is, what has been your most recent experience with VA copay?

Okay, so when I was in New York it was

[P7] 12:15:57
They were sending me the bills and I told him I was in school.

[P7] 12:16:06

[P7] 12:16:32
And it was only 3 years of bills, but it, it came up. Cause you know, 3 years is a long time when you.

[P7] 12:16:39
What you didn't have money and now you have money and then it comes up. And You know, I just had to pay it.

[P7] 12:16:49

[Moderator] 12:16:53
Hmm. Yeah, so I'm so sorry.

[P7] 12:16:55
So I had. I had to pay the debt.

[Moderator] 12:17:06
And you were or Washington, I'm sorry. And you received a hundred percent, coverage and despite this you were receiving bills for the care.

[P7] 12:17:19

[P7] 12:17:31
3 years ago.

[Moderator] 12:17:32

I mean, it comes, you know.

[P7] 12:17:39
The care that I received was from the VA.

[P7] 12:17:45
And I got the money from the VA. So the bills just came up immediately. So I had to pay it.

[Moderator] 12:17:56
Hmm. And Were you were you surprised that that happened given that you were receiving a hundred percent?

[P7] 12:18:03
Well, yes, I was surprised because

[P7] 12:18:09
Okay, so. I had a stroke. And with my stroke, it wasn't. Something devastating.

[Moderator] 12:18:13
Hmm.

[P7] 12:18:19
It was a mild, mild. It was so mild when you look at me, you can't even tell.

[P7] 12:18:27
But I can't add anymore. So. I don't and plus II have I have

[Moderator] 12:18:29
But what? Sorry.

[P7] 12:18:41
Of long term. Memory. I mean Anyway, I can't remember something. So.

[P7] 12:18:54
You know. It was like they said you had a debt. Okay, yeah, I know ahead of that.

[P7] 12:19:02
And they said they told me how much it was. Like, I don't know, like 3,000 or something.

[P7] 12:19:09
And I said, okay. But in my mind. I don't know whether She told me. I was gonna have it or what does she said?

[P7] 12:19:24
Oh, we'll get it later. You know, we'll get it from you later when you get the job or you know, Is I had no idea because in my, you know, it's And my mom.

[P7] 12:19:40
So, but the thing is, that when I had the stroke. And I went to the VA.

[P7] 12:19:47
And I said I had a stroke and now looking at me and they're like. You don't look like anything's wrong.

[Moderator] 12:19:55
Hmm.

[P7] 12:19:55
And, and they give me the memory test, you know. Apple whatever whatever. And I can remember that, but I can remember because they told to me that day.

[P7] 12:20:08
You understand what I'm saying? And so

[Moderator] 12:20:09
Hmm. Yeah.

[P7] 12:20:14
Okay, it took it took like. 4 or 5 months for me to say to them I had a stroke I had a stroke you know, because they didn't remember, they didn't know, I mean, they wrote it in a notes, of course.

[P7] 12:20:31
But II don't have any of the symptoms. You know what I mean? And so. And then coming back.

[Moderator] 12:20:37
Hmm.

[P7] 12:20:43
Going forward. And I had this bill, it's like. I don't I know she had told me I had a bill.

[P7] 12:20:53
But II thought she said. It was going away. Or maybe it was back. You know, I don't know.

[P7] 12:21:01
I don't know the difference.

[Moderator] 12:21:03
Yeah, yeah, it sounds like they didn't quite connect the dots between. Just everything that was happening with you and then you were built and then just

[P7] 12:21:04
So

[P7] 12:21:08
Yeah.

[P7] 12:21:11
Yeah It's really hard. It's really hard. You know, I know all the strokes are not the same.

[Moderator] 12:21:20
Yeah.

[P7] 12:21:20
I know that. But it's. When someone tells you

[P7] 12:21:27
Yeah, I had a stroke. And you they walk the same they look the same you know

[P7] 12:21:38
The only other thing I had beside. Memory loss and. Whatever else I said. I can't remember.

[P7] 12:21:49
Anyway,

[P7] 12:21:54
Let me see.

[P7] 12:21:55
I don't remember now. Forget it. I don't remember this. And that's that is what the stroke.

[Moderator] 12:22:01
Yeah, that sounds like it was really, yeah.

[Moderator] 12:22:04
Right, right. That sounds like it was like a frustrating experience and also probably scary also to go through that stroke and I'm so glad you're okay today.

[P7] 12:22:18
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine today. You know, it's not a problem.

[P7] 12:22:21
It's, you know, it's just that I, you know, it's, me.

[P7] 12:22:27
Because, you know, I have to say to myself, There's some things I have to do.

[P7] 12:22:33
And some of the things I have to do is. Like. Put it as trash. You know, you know, I know.

[P7] 12:22:44
Everybody has to put out the trash but you know, if I don't, if my trash is full and I don't remember.

[P7] 12:22:53
Then. Every day I look at it and say, oh, I'll put it up tomorrow. Put it up tomorrow.

[P7] 12:23:00
Put it up tomorrow. You know what I'm saying? I have to make a mental note. So that's how I remember things.

[P7] 12:23:08
Right. Have to make a mental note and I have to Use my cell phone. I have an iPhone.

[Moderator] 12:23:13
Yeah, the reminders and notes, right, right, absolutely. A lot of people. Yeah, do note taking to remember things and.

[P7] 12:23:24
Yeah, I mean, maybe people have this, but it's not, it wasn't. A problem for me before.

[Moderator] 12:23:26
It helps.

[P7] 12:23:34
What is the problem for me now? So it's not a big problem. Not a big problem to a lot of people.

[Moderator] 12:23:36
Yeah. Yeah.

[P7] 12:23:43
But it's a big problem to me.

[Moderator] 12:23:45
Yeah, yeah, I hear you. I hear that. Yeah, and are you receiving support from friends or family or medical, no.

[P7] 12:23:52
No Well, my family, I have support. But like. Okay, so for instance.

[P7] 12:24:04
When I first had to stroke, I was going to school. And you know. I didn't.

[P7] 12:24:14
I had time off from school.

[P7] 12:24:18
You know, I knew I had school. And I said, oh, I have school next semester.

[P7] 12:24:25
Yeah, I didn't go to school this semester. Oh my god. My GI Bill.

[P7] 12:24:30
You know what I mean? I was like, oh my gosh, on GI Bill and. Love, blah, blah, blah.

[Moderator] 12:24:31
Hmm.

[P7] 12:24:38
So I went to school. And I, you know, my daughter drove me to school and I. Told the instructor and he's looking at me.

[P7] 12:24:50
And I'm like, I had a stroke. And he's like and oh I The other problem I wanted to tell you was I

[P7] 12:25:01
Okay, so I don't You know, but II know this like. Like a word is missing.

[P7] 12:25:13
And I don't have it. You know, so that's what was happening when I was at school.

[Moderator] 12:25:15
Yeah.

[P7] 12:25:20
I was telling an instructor and I, you know, it was like. You know, some words were missing and he's staying there looking at me.

[P7] 12:25:28
He's probably thinking. But he's but. Before I was I was an A student

[Moderator] 12:25:38
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that sounds like.

[P7] 12:25:40
I'm not a.

[Moderator] 12:25:44
That sounds like a lot, but it sounds like you're coping great and you're doing your best.

[Moderator] 12:25:51
So, yeah, I'm glad you're okay today and if it's okay because we have a little bit of time left.

[P7] 12:25:58
Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:26:00
I'd love to go to the next part of the interview where we share the digital experience we're working on and ask for some feedback.

[P7] 12:26:07
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:26:09
So. I'll be sharing a prototype or a demo that will not work.

[Moderator] 12:26:15
Exactly the way you expect because some of the areas the prototype will be clickable and some will not.

[Moderator] 12:26:22
Some areas will be pre-filled with fake information. And since it since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

[Moderator] 12:26:33
And in this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback. About the quality of your experience filling out this form if you were to fill it up.

[Moderator] 12:26:41
So please remembering to comment on what is clear and unclear and please remembering to think out loud.

[Moderator] 12:26:48
I'll be sharing a link in the Zoom chat. And when you receive the link, I'll ask you to open the page and then share your screen and I can walk you through how to do that.

[Moderator] 12:27:01
So. I just, shared a link in the zoom chat and you should have seen a little popup.

[Moderator] 12:27:09
With the link so please click on the link.

[P7] 12:27:19
Okay.

[P7] 12:27:24
Okay.

[P7] 12:27:29
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:27:31
And. When you open the page, there should be like, you should see. A button that says click here to start.

[Moderator] 12:27:42
So you're on the right page. Is that what you see?

[P7] 12:27:46
I see. You're chatting. As a guest. Let's just send here are also posted.

[P7] 12:27:57
And the meeting group. Is that what you

[Moderator] 12:28:03
So I sent a link in, in the zoom chat and If you, Oh, you clicked it.

[P7] 12:28:07
Yeah, I clicked it.

[Moderator] 12:28:11
Okay. And, let's see. When you open it, do you see, a blue button that says proceed?

[Moderator] 12:28:24
And it's just.

[P7] 12:28:24
No. I see you're getting a. You're chatting as a guest and then I have a red button.

[Moderator] 12:28:34
I can also, maybe I can share my screen and take you through the experience. That way.

[Moderator] 12:28:42
If that's easier. So. And I might be able to.

[Moderator] 12:28:49
Give you control of my. My screen. Let's see, I'm gonna share my screen.

[Moderator] 12:29:09
Can you see my screen?

[P7] 12:29:14
Requests help. With the VA. Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:29:16
Perfect. Awesome. And so now I'm gonna see if I'm able to, give you the remote control.

[Moderator] 12:29:27
Oh, it looks like your name is not on the remote control, so I might. Just take you through the experience myself.

[Moderator] 12:29:36
Let's see. Yeah.

[P7] 12:29:37
That's

[Moderator] 12:29:39
Does that work for you? Okay, great. So imagine you navigated to this page because you want help with your VA.

[P7] 12:29:41
Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:29:51
I'll be, mostly observing silently and I'll ask you questions at certain times.

[Moderator] 12:29:57
Please remember to think out loud. And you can also, I can type in fake information when it's requesting, to be filled out feels that need to be filled out.

[P7] 12:30:10
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:30:10
So. Please take a moment to look at this page. And Just comment on anything that stands out or anything that's clear or unclear.

[P7] 12:30:31
Nothing stands out.

[Moderator] 12:30:33
Okay.

[P7] 12:30:41
Well, on it. You can take the page if you want to.

[Moderator] 12:30:46
Okay.

[P7] 12:31:01
Or you change the page.

[Moderator] 12:31:05
So would you, if you were on this page, would you go to the next page or would you read this page?

[P7] 12:31:11
I will go to the next page.

[Moderator] 12:31:13
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:31:18
And so here you can imagine it would actually say your personal information, but. Since this is a limited demo, we've pre-filled the information with somebody's fake name, Hector.

[P7] 12:31:30
Oh. Okay, so wait a minute.

[P7] 12:31:39
I press a button. And now I can scan the screen. So.

[Moderator] 12:31:47
So yes, so this is the the form and. It's it. Oh, I'm so sorry.

[P7] 12:31:52
Sorry. Alright.

[P7] 12:31:55
No, no, go ahead. Go ahead.

[Moderator] 12:31:57
Oh, I was just saying just kind of setting some context that this is a form to help with the copay debt.

[Moderator] 12:32:03
And so. This was the previous page. And we went forward, to the next page.

[Moderator] 12:32:10
Because you wanted to start your request now. But this is the previous page that we were on.

[P7] 12:32:16
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:32:17
And if you were filling out this form, I was wondering if you would take the time to read this.

[Moderator] 12:32:23
This intra page or if you would just go and start the form.

[P7] 12:32:30
Well, I would take time to read it.

[Moderator] 12:32:32
Okay, so. I'd love to hear your thoughts about this page and I'll go slowly and let me know when I can keep scrolling down.

[P7] 12:32:56
Well.

[P7] 12:33:02
I don't think there's anything. To me the request. I mean, I think the

[P7] 12:33:12
What you decided was fine. And. It's just a matter of.

[P7] 12:33:21
Well, I, well, yeah. Because if If I make the

[P7] 12:33:29
The request.

[P7] 12:33:34
To speak to someone. Then I can talk to someone. Go ahead.

[P7] 12:33:46
It's fine, I guess.

[Moderator] 12:33:50
Is that what you'd be most likely to do? Would you most likely call someone or maybe call, to help you with the form or, would you fill out the form on your own?

[P7] 12:34:00
I sell out the form on my own.

[P7] 12:34:08
Now if I were at the next page.

[P7] 12:34:14
Workers help with the VA. Open up.

[P7] 12:34:24
Hmm.

[P7] 12:34:48
Well, there's nothing to record. For me to add.

[P7] 12:34:56
Even the next page I added the I read everything.

[P7] 12:35:08
Look, I don't need to ask a VSO. You know. Bye.

[Moderator] 12:35:12
Okay, yeah.

[P7] 12:35:17
I understand it and. I would just move on to the next.

[Moderator] 12:35:20
Okay, so would you like me to click continue? Okay.

[P7] 12:35:23
Yes.

[P7] 12:35:31
I don't have a continue that you did so.

[Moderator] 12:35:35
I'm so sorry.

[P7] 12:35:37
Like if you press continue, I didn't see it.

[Moderator] 12:35:40

[P7] 12:35:51

My screen and you can go through the the form as you would in real life. So just take a moment to look at this page and please comment on anything that stands out or anything that's clear or unclear.

[P7] 12:40:54
We talked about the screen already. Yes.

[Moderator] 12:40:56
Okay, so you saw this one. Okay. Well, that's good. So I'll go, let me know when we get to the place where you.

[Moderator] 12:41:05
Didn't see the screen. Did you see this screen?

[P7] 12:41:08
Yes.

[Moderator] 12:41:09
Okay. What about this one?

[P7] 12:41:13
No.

[Moderator] 12:41:14
Okay, so I'll pause here.

[P7] 12:41:29
Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:41:29
And you can imagine here it would say your name and your personal information.

[P7] 12:41:33
Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:41:35
And let me know when you'd like me to click continue.

[P7] 12:41:38
Continue.

[P7] 12:41:48
So wait a minute, so.

[P7] 12:41:52
You're coming up with.

[P7] 12:41:56
What you're saying is good for them to pay.

[Moderator] 12:42:00
So this would be a reflection of what current debts. The veteran has.

[P7] 12:42:08
Okay, so $20 or the whole thing or is that the whole thing?

[Moderator] 12:42:16
Yep, so you can make some selections here. Would you select both or just one?

[P7] 12:42:24
That's select one if I had a debt.

[Moderator] 12:42:27
Okay. And let me know when you'd like me to click continue.

[P7] 12:42:31
Oh, well, it doesn't matter, right? Because if I was if I were Hector.

[P7] 12:42:42
I would select $20.

[Moderator] 12:42:44
Okay.

[P7] 12:42:49
Okay, continue.

[Moderator] 12:42:51
Okay.

[P7] 12:42:57
Continue.

[P7] 12:43:03
Yeah, continue. Oh, well, yeah. That's right.

[Moderator] 12:43:09
Okay.

[P7] 12:43:15
Oh.

[P7] 12:43:24
Oh yeah, continue.

[P7] 12:43:46
Yeah, continue. I mean.

[P7] 12:43:52
Continue.

[P7] 12:44:02
Wait a minute, so you're saying that Hector has a debt. Of $2,100 and $3,100 or $1,100

[P7] 12:44:18
Hmm.

[Moderator] 12:44:26
What does this page mean to you? What do you see here?

[P7] 12:44:30
Disability compensation and pension benefits.

[Moderator] 12:44:34
Okay.

[P7] 12:44:35
And then he gets.

[P7] 12:44:41
$1,100.

[P7] 12:44:46
Yeah. I have.

[P7] 12:44:55
I guess if I were had my I'd say.

[P7] 12:45:01
Considering he has $3,200.

[P7] 12:45:11
Then I guess he could pay something. More than $20.

[Moderator] 12:45:22
And so based on what you've seen so far. How do you feel at this point in the form?

[P7] 12:45:33
I would feel he probably could pay more.

[P7] 12:45:40
No, of course. How much more? Right.

[P7] 12:45:50
I would say $50.

[P7] 12:45:54
You know. Just looking out. Same.

[P7] 12:46:02
Well, you only have $2,100 during.

[P7] 12:46:07
December and January.

[Moderator] 12:46:10
And so here. Looking at the benefits Hector has the system can tell you how much benefits you have, like what benefits you have and on the previous page you could look at.

[Moderator] 12:46:24
The debts, the active debts.

[P7] 12:46:28
Wait a minute, so wait, so $2,100 is as we both know is the benefit. But, $1,100 is the what?

[P7] 12:46:41
What are you saying it is?

[Moderator] 12:46:42
I love it. Oh, okay. So it's education benefits and

[P7] 12:46:47
Okay. Yes. Because you only have $1,100. It's only part of the month.

[P7] 12:46:57
For December. You don't have it. Yes.

[Moderator] 12:47:01
Oh yeah, like the math doesn't seem quite right. II see what you mean. Yeah, I see that too.

[P7] 12:47:07
Yes.

[Moderator] 12:47:07
Well, like I said, it is kind of just fake information just for, yeah, but you're right, we should make it more, easy to understand.

[P7] 12:47:11
Well, yeah, it is, but I mean.

[P7] 12:47:17
Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:47:18
Yeah, that's not that's unclear. Is it okay if I click continue take you to the next page?

[P7] 12:47:22
Yes.

[P7] 12:47:32
Oh.

[Moderator] 12:47:34
Is anything clear or unclear on this page?

[P7] 12:47:44
No, you should ask for income and

[P7] 12:47:50
Should be extra income.

[Moderator] 12:47:52
Okay.

[P7] 12:47:53
Yeah. I guess.

[Moderator] 12:47:59
I'll take you to the next page. So here you can imagine you would have selected investment income and employment income and pl.

[Moderator] 12:48:10

[Moderator] 12:48:14

[P7] 12:54:14

[P7] 12:54:20
That you know. You have to make a mental note. Me? I did it on this state.

[P7] 12:54:31
You know, I submitted it and

[P7] 12:54:34
They'll get back to me and.

[P7] 12:54:38
30 or 60 days or

[Moderator] 12:54:41
Yeah. So a reminder that you sold out the form.

[P7] 12:54:44
Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:54:47
Thank you.

[Moderator] 12:54:50
So now that we've gone through this form, what was your overall experience? Like with the form?

[P7] 12:55:03
Is she asking me some more money? No.

[P7] 12:55:15
Well, it doesn't really apply to me.

[Moderator] 12:55:21
Yeah.

[P7] 12:55:22
But.

[Moderator] 12:55:25
Or I mentioned maybe several years ago when you got those bills and this was this would have been if this form were online back then.

[Moderator] 12:55:36
This would be an opportunity to fill out the form and request help. And so. How would if you had filled out this form back then when it was, would have been helpful.

[Moderator] 12:55:53
How was the experience of going through the form today? Was it? How easy or difficult was it?

[P7] 12:55:59
Well, it was easy, I felt.

[Moderator] 12:56:01
Okay.

[P7] 12:56:03
It was in the comfort of your own home. You could

[P7] 12:56:10
Take time with it. If you need a time.

[P7] 12:56:18
I don't know.

[Moderator] 12:56:21
So like in the comfort of your own home, you can take your time filling it out.

[P7] 12:56:25
Yeah, I mean as long as you have enough time. Based on when you start to fill it out in.

[Moderator] 12:56:29
Yeah, absolutely.

[P7] 12:56:35
Completed.

[Moderator] 12:56:37
Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah, having the time to fill it out.

[Moderator] 12:56:42
Does ask for a lot of information.

[Moderator] 12:56:56
And so in this last part of the interview, I wanted to go back and share one of the pages we saw in the beginning.

[Moderator] 12:57:04
Which was the introduction page. So here it's like one of the first things you see before you fill out the form.

[Moderator] 12:57:12
And outlines the steps. To fill out the form. So first prepare, it tells you. What documents to, grab a hold of.

[P7] 12:57:21
I' to that.

[Moderator] 12:57:24
Have you? Oh, all firms do that.

[P7] 12:57:27
All forms to that.

[Moderator] 12:57:30
Yeah. Yeah, definitely. It's, that preparation phase. So I guess my question is, so this is one version where there's more information and we have the same version of this intro page on the next page.

[Moderator] 12:57:48
That I'll click on right now. And here you can see that it has the steps, but it doesn't have.

[P7] 12:57:49
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:57:56
As much information about which documents specifically to grab, but it has less text. And

[P7] 12:58:03
Oh.

[Moderator] 12:58:06
And my question is based on these 2 versions, this one's the second one, which one would be best for you?

[P7] 12:58:15
Well, I don't have any debt now, but.

[P7] 12:58:22
I think. I think that. They would be better suited with the first form. Because

[P7] 12:58:35
It tells you specifically. Specifically. What you need. In terms of assets.

[P7] 12:58:45
And income.

[Moderator] 12:58:49
Yeah. Yep, I can see that definitely. Those specifics.

[P7] 12:58:56
I think, you know, it's just.

[P7] 12:59:01
Now that I'm older. I think it's better once you have all the information available to you.

[P7] 12:59:10
Then you can. You can get it out and you can sit down with the form. To do it the second way.

[P7] 12:59:21
Doesn't list the

[Moderator] 12:59:27
This way.

[P7] 12:59:28
Yes.

[P7] 12:59:32
You know. Like you sit down with some of the papers, but you won't have all the papers.

[Moderator] 12:59:39
Absolutely. Yeah.

[P7] 12:59:39
You know. You don't have everything that you need. In order to. Get the response you're looking for.

[Moderator] 12:59:51
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you for feedback. I think that's all the questions I have.

[Moderator] 13:00:01
Let me ask my team, Joe and Megan, if they have any other questions. And in the meantime, do you have any questions for us?

[P7] 13:00:10
No, I don't. Thank you.

[Moderator] 13:00:12
Okay, thank you. Very big. Thank you for your time today for helping us improve this experience for all veterans.

[Moderator] 13:00:21
Your feedback has been really helpful. And I hope you have a good rest of your day.

[P7] 13:00:26
You too

[Moderator] 13:00:27
Thank you
