[Moderator] 14:15:04
So before I get started, as I mentioned earlier, we're going to go through a form and ask you to fill it out as you would normally.

[Moderator] 14:15:14
And as I mentioned earlier, some of the information has been pre-filled. So imagine, so I'll please click proceed and it'll take us to the first page.

[Moderator] 14:15:27
Right. And so, and you can probably, close out that little popup.

[Moderator] 14:15:35
Awesome. So it mentioned that you navigate to this page because you want help with here via copay.

[Moderator] 14:15:42
So I'll be observing silently and I'll ask you questions at certain times.

[Moderator] 14:15:47
Please remember to think out loud and comment on anything that's stands out. You can use fake information for the form.

[Moderator] 14:15:54
And so, whenever you're ready, please just, get started.

[P8] 14:16:09
Such I press the because help with VA form 5 6 5 5

[Moderator] 14:16:15
Yep, whenever you're ready.

[Moderator] 14:16:26
So I noticed that you skipped ahead on the previous page. And I was wondering why that is.

[P8] 14:16:32
Oh, I'm not supposed to, scroll down.

[Moderator] 14:16:35
Well, the reason I'm asking is that some people read the page and some people skip ahead.

[Moderator] 14:16:41
So just wondering if there was a reason why you skipped ahead. If.

[P8] 14:16:47
Oh, I find that. Yes, I's not let me get my comment on that.

[P8] 14:16:52
Yeah, if, if you want people to read the, information before proceeding to the next page, then maybe you get that links to be at the bottom.

[Moderator] 14:17:02
Yeah, absolutely. That's great feedback. And great observation. Great.

[Moderator] 14:17:09
So, we'll revisit that page later. That in the next few sections, please go through this sections and let me know if anything seems clear or unclear.

[Moderator] 14:17:20
I'm mostly going to be observing.

[P8] 14:17:29
So this page, my feedback is, oh, I said that yeah, definitely like this page where it displays, your information.

[P8] 14:17:38
So it make sure that like the information is correct. So, so I like that.

[P8] 14:18:08
Oh

[P8] 14:18:23
And then again, yeah, I like this page where it, the space, content information and it allows you to edit if it's incorrect.

[Moderator] 14:18:31
Hey.

[P8] 14:18:51
And I like the fact that it. Tells you like what who qualifies as a dependent.

[P8] 14:18:57
That's good.

[Moderator] 14:19:09
And so here, we've pre selected. 3 dependence but in the real form it would it would have reflected your selection of just one.

[P8] 14:19:22
Let's see.

[P8] 14:19:49
Steps.

[P8] 14:19:59
Alright.

[Moderator] 14:21:30
And how are you feeling at this point in the form?

[P8] 14:21:33
Pretty straightforward. Yeah, so far.

[Moderator] 14:21:38
Okay, great.

[P8] 14:21:51
Okay, yeah, and then yeah, I think we like this page as well like shows your benefits.

[Moderator] 14:21:59
Have you seen something like this before on VA.gov?

[P8] 14:22:04
Cool.

[Moderator] 14:22:05
Where it shows your benefits.

[P8] 14:22:07
It does like it.

[P8] 14:22:14
This, yeah, it, yeah, the, of those show, like, Ben in a, like, different format.

[Moderator] 14:22:22
I see. Okay, and it sounds like you like this format.

[P8] 14:22:25
Yeah, actually, you provide this one.

[Moderator] 14:22:29
And why is that?

[P8] 14:22:30
He says, first of all, yeah, it shows, Everything. That like because if I think like right now it shows the, the education benefits and the, health care benefits like separately, like on like different pages.

[P8] 14:22:48
So I think it's easy to see and like to manage your benefits if they are on the same page.

[Moderator] 14:22:55
I see. That makes sense. Thanks for your feedback.

[P8] 14:23:14
Can you use that?

[P8] 14:23:25
Wow.

[P8] 14:23:29
And then. And

[Moderator] 14:24:10
Hmm. Please pause here. What does cash on hands mean to you?

[P8] 14:24:17
Cash on him, and they say it's not in the bank. So, so I would say like cash like in my wallet or like at home.

[Moderator] 14:24:29
And does this supply to you? Is this something that you would know and that's applicable to you?

[P8] 14:24:39
I mean, does, but I'm still feeling nowadays most people, probably don't have.

[P8] 14:24:44
That much cash on hand, if any. You see like why. Right, it's still important to ask that question.

[P8] 14:24:53
Because like some people like do still use.

[P8] 14:24:58
Hash a lot and then, and then like some people, yeah, some people may not even have a bank account and then they have like the entire savings in cash.

[Moderator] 14:25:06
Right, right.

[P8] 14:25:09
And I think, yeah, it's definitely good that. In the explanation, in the parentheses, is not in bad, not in the bank so it clarifies.

[P8] 14:25:18
The definition of cash on hand and otherwise like people yeah could have like different interpretation of the term

[Moderator] 14:25:25
Right, absolutely. Great feedback. Thank you.

[Moderator] 14:25:40
And what does this page mean to you?

[P8] 14:25:44
So we feel information.

[P8] 14:25:56
This page just kind of means you understand what you feel out and then like understand the

[P8] 14:26:04
Almost like the legal, application of, the form.

[Moderator] 14:26:10
Right.

[P8] 14:26:13
Yeah, and in terms of like you understand that you read and accepted the privacy policy.

[Moderator] 14:26:22
Was anything clear or unclear on the previous page?

[P8] 14:26:26
I think it was pretty clear.

[Moderator] 14:26:28
Okay.

[P8] 14:26:32
Information.

[P8] 14:26:38
Let me see.

[P8] 14:26:46
It's not.

[P8] 14:26:57
I'm not sure what it is because it's a, port, so I'm trying to expand the, household encompass not letting you, but anyway, I can see.

[Moderator] 14:27:05
Right. Yeah, correct. It's one of the errors that's not clickable. So normally you could expand it.

[P8] 14:27:10
Okay, bye. Okay, so that's good that you're able to. Double check all your information before submitting the phone.

[P8] 14:27:24
And pattern statement true.

[P8] 14:27:32
Yeah, sounds good.

[P8] 14:27:42
And then again, you know, tells you like the. Legal consequences of, submitting for statements.

[P8] 14:28:00
Start it.

[Moderator] 14:28:06
What are your thoughts about this page?

[P8] 14:28:11
Yeah, so it's not the great that shows you like the confirmation that you're

[P8] 14:28:17
OUGH, for or I'm assuming you've, if you've not algebra and then tells you that you're not eligible, so it's great to get the instant feedback on that.

[P8] 14:28:28
Also tells you what you can expect as good.

[P8] 14:28:34
You don't need to do anything else at this time. And it's also really great that gives you, a contact number.

[P8] 14:28:44
To call in case like you have questions or in case you didn't see anything.

[P8] 14:28:51
In that only it's great that you can point out the, you know, download the phone.

[P8] 14:28:59
And it also tells you how you can chat the status.

[P8] 14:29:04
Yeah, yeah, we like this page like yes, like with good information and then it's also really easy to.

[P8] 14:29:14
Yeah, everything. Yeah, everything's pretty good.

[Moderator] 14:29:17
And how do you feel about where it says you're eligible for a waiver? What does that mean to you?

[P8] 14:29:26
So to me it means that you need the

[P8] 14:29:33
You, you meet like the minimum qualifications for the. But it That's not necessarily need that you will have a ways.

[P8] 14:29:44
Just need to, yeah, algebra for over one.

[Moderator] 14:29:49
Hi. And so now that you've gone through this form, what was your overall experience with the form like?

[P8] 14:29:56
I think overall, is, very positively, I think it's Very easy to use like way easy to navigate and.

[P8] 14:30:06
And I don't have, yeah, any issues like filling out the form. But I like that the definition of by each term, like what you need to fill out.

[Moderator] 14:30:10
Great.

[P8] 14:30:18
Yeah. I think that's really easy to use.

[Moderator] 14:30:20
Awesome. And what would you change if anything?

[P8] 14:30:24
Hmm.

[P8] 14:30:31
I think maybe other than Yeah, that's first page where I have the link. At the bottom, send a, Think everything.

[Moderator] 14:30:41
Great. And speaking of that page, I would love to revisit that page. So if you go to the next screen, you can click on print this page and it will take you to the next page.

[Moderator] 14:30:51
So if you scroll down about midway.

[Moderator] 14:30:57
Where it says in blueprint this page. And then click there. So this is the page that you skipped initially.

[Moderator] 14:31:06
And so please take a moment just to read through it.

[P8] 14:31:08
Oh.

[P8] 14:31:18
Okay, yeah, so yeah, this is great, at least, you know. As a list of like more information you need and then yeah like how to Almost like have a And then maybe.

[P8] 14:31:32
If, whether you're eligible for the form or not.

[P8] 14:31:48
So you also, like, things why you're asking for this information because like otherwise, would be.

[P8] 14:31:55
You know, like, Yeah, probably like, they'll be like, normally strangely.

[P8] 14:32:02
To be asked on this information, but yeah, it's great that you the website explains that.

[Moderator] 14:32:08
And how do you feel about what it says in under that question in blue?

[P8] 14:32:13
So they want to make sure we fully understand your financial situation. Maybe we don't need to understand.

[P8] 14:32:25
The best decision.

[P8] 14:32:31
I'm actually.

[P8] 14:32:35
Thank you. The.

[P8] 14:32:44
Yeah, I think it's great. It emphasizes that the. That'll be able to collect the income.

[P8] 14:32:53
So like it, helps. The the person thing on this farm.

[P8] 14:33:00
Yeah, help, yeah, helps them to, put the accurate information on it. Even though they should anyway because of why that last page lately.

[P8] 14:33:07
You're not supposed to, submit, false information, but, it, it's good that it kind of, put the better at ease like we should be better in that the.

[P8] 14:33:19
Information just to help the VA understand the financial situation it's not like

[P8] 14:33:26
Trying to. Yeah, try to like repossess the belongings.

[Moderator] 14:33:31
Right, right. Great feedback. Great. And so now that you've seen this.

[Moderator] 14:33:38
Version of the intro page, I want to show you another version that we're thinking about.

[Moderator] 14:33:42
If you click anywhere on the screen, it will take you to the next page.

[Moderator] 14:33:47
So take a moment to look at this. This page. It's a little bit different.

[P8] 14:34:02
Okay, yeah, personal, I you get loved that, again, pre feel, positive, it saves time.

[P8] 14:34:13
And then also, yeah, also it's great that you can save your requests. In progress like in case I couldn't finish it in one city.

[P8] 14:34:42
You know, I'm saying also, yeah, it's good that it tells you like the amount of time.

[Moderator] 14:34:42
Sorry.

[P8] 14:34:48
You, to spend on the phone.

[Moderator] 14:34:51
And based on this page and the previous page we saw which version of the intro page would be best for you.

[Moderator] 14:34:59
And so the biggest difference is if you scroll up a little bit. And the Prepare section number one.

[Moderator] 14:35:08
We have just the headers. We don't have all the detail of what documents specifically you need to provide.

[Moderator] 14:35:18
So just a listing of the sections. What version is would be best for you if you were to go through this this form?

[P8] 14:35:27
I prefer the last session, but question number one way it. List out like the in addition to the header like the.

[P8] 14:35:38
Bullet points like underneath each one. I, yeah, for me, like, I prefer to have more information rather than, less information.

[Moderator] 14:35:46
Okay. And that makes sense. And which version would you be most likely to read? If you were to see the previous version or this version.

[P8] 14:35:58
So for me

[P8] 14:36:02
So personally for me, I actually would, more likely to read the previous version. Like because I'm like.

[P8] 14:36:11
For me, like if I'm putting out a phone, it means I'm probably, have the, edit that and then like, yeah, As.

[P8] 14:36:22
Much information as possible.

[Moderator] 14:36:26
Yeah.

[P8] 14:36:26
Other people they may like prefer this version, it's like they may not like want to be all the extra stuff, but.

[P8] 14:36:36
But I would prefer the, the extra information.

[Moderator] 14:36:41
Great feedback. Great. So.

[Moderator] 14:36:46
That's, those are all the questions I have for you today. I'm going to ask my team if they have any follow up questions.

[Moderator] 14:36:56
And in the meantime, do you have any questions for us?

[P8] 14:37:01
So, you know, some point do you think, the, changes will be made to the, website.

[Moderator] 14:37:08
So currently we have this experience live, on VA. Gov where you can see any active debts you have and you can submit a financial status report form.

[Moderator] 14:37:20
To get help with your debt. So that's live today and this version of the experience is one that we're working on, but there is a live version of this right now.

[Moderator] 14:37:30
And I can share that link with you. And also. I can have, our contact at, send it to you also by email if you'd like

[P8] 14:37:30
