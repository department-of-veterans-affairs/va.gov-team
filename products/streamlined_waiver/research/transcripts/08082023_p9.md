[Moderator] 12:07:08
Recording, do I have your permission to video record this interview? Okay, wonderful. Thank you.

[P9] 12:07:12
Yes.

[Moderator] 12:07:17
So my next question is about your service in the military. And if you're comfortable sharing, could you please tell me about the most important or memorable parts of your service?

[P9] 12:07:32
The most memorable part is not, not good. So.

[Moderator] 12:07:35
Okay, well. Yeah, okay, well. Definitely, no, no expectation that you, share things that are, uncomfortable or, not good.

[P9] 12:07:47
Right. Okay.

[Moderator] 12:07:48
So we can, move on to the next question. So let's see. So just to introduce what we'll be talking about today, today I'll be taking you through a form to help with VA copay debt.

[Moderator] 12:08:02
And before I share the demo or the prototype. I'd like to briefly hear about your experiences with VA copay debt.

[Moderator] 12:08:11
So my question, what my question is, what has been your most recent experience with VA Copay?

[P9] 12:08:17
Well, it's not that I only I qualify, so I only have to pay for prescription drug coverage.

[P9] 12:08:26
Through the VA, but it's still some. Because I'm on disability, I have limited income.

[P9] 12:08:35
It's still even just the medication copays are difficult. To pay for some months. So.

[Moderator] 12:08:46
So the medication copays are difficult to pay sun months even though you are receiving disability. Yes, and this is through.

[P9] 12:08:53
Yes, well, I just get I don't get disability to the military. It's through.

[Moderator] 12:09:00
Okay, understood Understood. And have you, ever had VA medical debt?

[P9] 12:09:01
So security disability.

[Moderator] 12:09:10
Like maybe gotten a bill in, in the mail and, or anything.

[P9] 12:09:13
I have a bill right now that I haven't paid yet. So yeah, it's for prescription drugs through the VA.

[Moderator] 12:09:16
I see, okay, and it's through the Okay.

[P9] 12:09:22
Yes.

[Moderator] 12:09:22
I see. Okay. Okay, and have you ever filled out, a form to help with those bills?

[Moderator] 12:09:30
Through the VA.

[P9] 12:09:31
I did. I filled out a form and submitted it there at the VA. And then they want all these, you know, proof of house payment, proof of insurance, all these, what you have to pay out.

[P9] 12:09:48
And I just. I got frustrated and I never followed through because they didn't even tell me I needed all that to begin with.

[P9] 12:09:57
At the VA when I went. And they they rejected it, mailed it back to me, said, well, we need all this stuff.

[P9] 12:10:05
Well, you know. I was just, it was frustrating and so I just didn't. Send it back.

[P9] 12:10:14
I never sent it back in.

[Moderator] 12:10:16
Sounds like it was frustrating. Do, Can you tell me if it was a paper form or like a digital?

[P9] 12:10:23
It was a pay. It was about a year ago, year or so ago. Yeah. No, some sort of waiver hardship something.

[Moderator] 12:10:28
Do you remember what it was called?

[Moderator] 12:10:35
Okay, sounds like. Maybe the financial status report form.

[P9] 12:10:36
Perfect.

[P9] 12:10:44
No, because isn't that what you fill out for? Every year for so they can. Put you in the groups, you know, like priority groups.

[Moderator] 12:10:57
Hmm. Okay, so it might be slightly different. So we'll be sharing an experience today that might look a little bit familiar.

[Moderator] 12:11:06
So once I share it, maybe you'll be able to tell me if you've seen something similar before.

[P9] 12:11:08
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:11:12
But moving on to the next part of the interview. I'm going to be sharing a digital experience that we're working on and ask for your feedback.

[Moderator] 12:11:20
A few things I want you to know. Firstly, you'll be interacting with a prototype that will not work exactly the way you expect.

[Moderator] 12:11:28
Some areas of the prototype will be clickable and some will not some areas will be pre-filled with fake information.

[Moderator] 12:11:36
And since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

[Moderator] 12:11:43
And in this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback about the quality of your experience filling out this form if you were to fill it out.

[P9] 12:11:51
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:11:51
Please, please remembering to, think out loud and to comment on anything that is clear or unclear.

[P9] 12:11:59
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:12:00
And so are you joining on mobile or desktop today?

[P9] 12:12:04
It is an Android tablet. It's a Samsung.

[Moderator] 12:12:07
Okay. Okay. Okay, so I will share this prototype with you. I will be sharing it in the Zoom chat.

[Moderator] 12:12:20
And. Let me know when you see the link and if you're able to open the link.

[P9] 12:12:32
Yes. Well, let's see.

[P9] 12:12:40
Are you still there? Okay.

[Moderator] 12:12:41
I'm still there.

[P9] 12:12:46
Says you're going to open a mobile automatic waiver financial status report.

[Moderator] 12:12:50
Correct. That's right. That's exactly it.

[P9] 12:12:56
Okay, so do you want me to proceed?

[Moderator] 12:13:00
So. Before you proceed, I would like you to share your screen. So if you're able to navigate back to the, zoom.

[Moderator] 12:13:09
Where you could see me. And Actually, I might wanna share a different version with you.

[P9] 12:13:15
Hmm.

[Moderator] 12:13:19
I'm so sorry. If, If you don't mind opening. This, maybe closing that other window and opening this one.

[Moderator] 12:13:27
So I'll give you a moment.

[Moderator] 12:13:33
We have 2 versions of the. The experience and one is better for tablets. So I just sent the second version that might look better on, on the Android tablet.

[Moderator] 12:13:46
And whenever you see it, please open the second link.

[P9] 12:13:53
See it.

[Moderator] 12:13:55
Oh, I'll send it in the chat one more time.

[P9] 12:13:58
Okay.

[P9] 12:14:15
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:14:17
And so once you have that page open.

[Moderator] 12:14:21
You could please, navigate back to the zoom and I can, take you through how to screen share.

[P9] 12:14:29
How do I navigate back to the Zoom?

[Moderator] 12:14:32
Oh, I see you. I think you're back. Do you see me?

[P9] 12:14:36
No. Oh, wait a minute. Zoom. Okay.

[Moderator] 12:14:40
Yep. I'm here. So now that you're back.

[Moderator] 12:14:46
I'm going to help you, share your screen. So. You should see audio video share content and 3 dots over to the right on the bottom of the zoom screen.

[Moderator] 12:14:59
And if you see that, I'd like you to share your screen with me by tapping on the arrow that says share content.

[P9] 12:15:08
But see, I don't see you all I see is the screen. Yeah, has the links.

[Moderator] 12:15:15
Oh, so you don't see me, you're not, you're not in the zoom right now.

[Moderator] 12:15:20
You don't see the zoom screen.

[P9] 12:15:24
No, I don't see the zoom screen. All I see is the links that you sent. There's a close at the top.

[P9] 12:15:35
Hmm. Let's see, that's not gonna do it.

[P9] 12:15:45
I don't know how to get back to you with this.

[Moderator] 12:15:48
With the with the tablet. Are, do you know how to get back to your, tablet home screen where you see all the apps.

[P9] 12:15:57
Yes.

[Moderator] 12:15:59
So if you go there, there should be a zoom icon that you can click on.

[P9] 12:16:09
And when I click on that, it just opens up the streamline user. Streamlined waiver usedability study with with the links in it.

[P9] 12:16:22
I don't see you, I just see the links. To click on.

[Moderator] 12:16:26
Juice. Oh, okay. So you see the chat.

[P9] 12:16:31
Yes.

[Moderator] 12:16:31
On the zoom chat. Okay.

[Moderator] 12:16:37
So if you're in the chat, I would. Do you see any toolbar where?

[Moderator] 12:16:44
You can see.

[P9] 12:16:47
I'm looking. I'm

[P9] 12:16:53
Hmm.

[Moderator] 12:16:56
Or perhaps if that doesn't work, if you close, the chat.

[P9] 12:17:04
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:17:07
And what do you see now?

[P9] 12:17:08
I see you now. Now that I close the chat.

[Moderator] 12:17:10
Oh, oh great. Okay, so that worked. Thank you for your patience. So next, if you tap in the screen where you see me.

[Moderator] 12:17:20
There should be a toolbar that shows up where it says participants, chat, share screen.

[P9] 12:17:26
Right. And then there, well, there's see. Oh, okay. Let's see more.

[P9] 12:17:34
This is chats, slow captions, meeting settings. Background and effects and a whiteboard.

[Moderator] 12:17:42
There's no share screen option.

[P9] 12:17:45
Not that I'm seeing.

[Moderator] 12:17:47
Okay, so if there's no share screen option, I might have to share my screen and take you through the.

[Moderator] 12:17:57
Experience myself. Because that might be a tablet limitations. So. Just a moment while I opened the link.

[P9] 12:18:00
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:18:22
And so I'll be sharing my screen now.

[P9] 12:18:37
Okay. Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:18:38
You can see my screen. Great. And let me see actually. I can try something where I can, give you the remote control.

[Moderator] 12:18:49
So it's actually where if I Give you the remote control, you'll be able to control the screen that I'm sharing.

[P9] 12:18:57
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:18:57
So I'm gonna try that out right now.

[Moderator] 12:19:02
And I just gave you the remote control. Let me know if that works.

[P9] 12:19:07
I tapped it.

[P9] 12:19:11
Let's see.

[P9] 12:19:15
So do you want me click the little keyboard icon or?

[Moderator] 12:19:22
Yes, so. Go ahead and try to.

[P9] 12:19:25
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:19:32
Looks like I. Lost the window.

[Moderator] 12:19:38
Hmm.

[P9] 12:19:40
You can navigate, I can tell you where.

[Moderator] 12:19:44
Yeah, let me try.

[P9] 12:19:48
I can watch, read it. And, and let you know where to navigate that might be the easier route.

[P9] 12:19:56
I don't know.

[Moderator] 12:19:56
That might be the easiest. I just wanna try one last. Option here and see if it. Works.

[Moderator] 12:20:13
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:20:26
I just, sent you the remote control again. Let's try it one last time and if that doesn't work, I'll just.

[Moderator] 12:20:34
To it myself.

[P9] 12:20:40
I clicked it and I put a little mouse on the screen.

[Moderator] 12:20:44
Okay, I think I can see your mouse. Are you able to swipe up and down?

[P9] 12:20:48
No. No.

[Moderator] 12:20:49
No, okay.

[Moderator] 12:20:53
So let me.

[Moderator] 12:21:02
Stop the remote control. Okay, I will take you through the form. So just to set some context, we're going to go through a form and ask you to fill it out as you were would normally.

[P9] 12:21:06
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:21:15
As I mentioned earlier because this is a demo some information has been pre-filled already with fake information So imagine you navigate to this page because you want help with your VA copay debt.

[Moderator] 12:21:30
I'll be observing silently and I'll ask you questions at certain times. Please remember to think out loud.

[P9] 12:21:35
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:21:35
And I will move slowly through the page.

[P9] 12:21:55
You can.

[Moderator] 12:22:17
And let me know when you want me to go to the next page.

[P9] 12:22:21
I think the financial status report I've. For this year I've already filled out. So we would, I would either need to do that waiver.

[P9] 12:22:33
I was at the top.

[Moderator] 12:22:35
Okay.

[P9] 12:22:38
I'm assuming that's the way for there.

[P9] 12:22:49
No. Scroll, scroll. Yeah, thank you.

[Moderator] 12:22:56
Okay.

[P9] 12:23:02
And I just go back up to the top.

[P9] 12:23:07
Start the request.

[P9] 12:23:18
And just continue. You know.

[P9] 12:23:29
So list out, it list out, it would list out the different places that you've gone.

[Moderator] 12:23:37
Is that what it seems like here?

[P9] 12:23:40
Yeah Yeah, it looks like this particular person went to 2 different. Well, I guess one is a VA medical center And then the other ones at Veterans Hospital.

[P9] 12:23:57
So I would just, I don't know, I click on the higher dollar amount and continue.

[Moderator] 12:24:01
Okay.

[P9] 12:24:07
And I just continue.

[P9] 12:24:14
And then I would just say no because, well. I'm not married. And continue.

[P9] 12:24:24
And then I wouldn't put any dependent.

[P9] 12:24:29
Continue.

[Moderator] 12:24:30
And so here you can imagine it would reflect what you selected before, but because of the limitations. With.

[P9] 12:24:38
Right.

[Moderator] 12:24:40
Preselected these.

[P9] 12:24:45
And I would say no.

[P9] 12:24:53
Then I would just check to make sure that's correct and continue.

[P9] 12:25:09
For me I'll just choose Social Security but that's would be my income.

[P9] 12:25:15
And continue.

[P9] 12:25:34
Yeah, just continued there.

[P9] 12:25:48
See you.

[P9] 12:25:55
Yeah, on hand, 10 bucks.

[P9] 12:25:59
Yeah, just fill it out.

[Moderator] 12:26:02
What does cash on hand mean to you?

[P9] 12:26:05
That means what you have with you. What you have in your purse. You know, wallet.

[Moderator] 12:26:10
Okay.

[P9] 12:26:14
To me, that's what it means.

[P9] 12:26:16
So.

[Moderator] 12:26:17
And how do you feel about this question? Does it apply to you?

[P9] 12:26:25
That's what I have is $10. So yeah, I'm Yeah. And then just continue.

[Moderator] 12:26:27
Okay, so it does. Yep. Okay.

[P9] 12:26:43
Just continue.

[Moderator] 12:26:45
What are your thoughts on this page? On the content.

[P9] 12:26:48
Where does it ask how much your house payment is and all that? I mean, does this form? Oh, all that information.

[Moderator] 12:26:58
Is that something?

[P9] 12:26:58
Is it like this shorter form? It's not something that they, I mean before. I don't I don't even have that form now.

[P9] 12:27:09
But before would want to know. What's your like my mortgage payment and your What your bills are and

[Moderator] 12:27:19
Right. Right, so this seems like a different shorter form.

[P9] 12:27:19
All that stuff. Is it? Yes.

[Moderator] 12:27:26
Yeah, yup. And that's absolutely right. It's a version of the form that you've already filled out, it sounds like.

[Moderator] 12:27:34
No. So based on your previous experience with this form, how do you feel about seeing that you're able to skip questions on this form?

[P9] 12:27:47
Well, it makes it easier. I mean, I'm not an old, I mean, I'm old, but I'm not an old does a lot of veterans that I see at the hospital something like this would make it much easier for those folks.

[P9] 12:28:02
Along with myself.

[Moderator] 12:28:06
And when you you filled out this form before, Can you remind me, was it on paper or online?

[P9] 12:28:13
It was, it was on paper because I did it.

[Moderator] 12:28:15
On background.

[P9] 12:28:18
They gave it to me at the VA and I filled it out and I took it back up there and they looked it over and they said, okay, we'll get this back to our.

[P9] 12:28:27
I think she called it a finance department or something like that. And then a week later I get that form in the mail tell me it's incomplete because I didn't because I didn't have they wanted.

[P9] 12:28:41
Proof of how much my house payment was and how much my bills were and all that. And so it's frustrated me, so I just.

[Moderator] 12:28:48
I see, I see. And.

[P9] 12:28:55
Didn't mess with it anymore.

[Moderator] 12:28:58
And when you say you didn't mess with it anymore, what do you mean by that?

[P9] 12:29:02
I didn't try to get help. I just I paid the bill whenever I could and

[Moderator] 12:29:04
I see.

[Moderator] 12:29:10
Nice.

[P9] 12:29:10
I actually had family members help me out with it.

[Moderator] 12:29:13
Okay, okay. Thank you for sharing.

[P9] 12:29:15
Because they would, yeah.

[Moderator] 12:29:20
So. Back to this page. Let me know when you want me to click. Continue.

[P9] 12:29:26
You can go ahead and click.

[Moderator] 12:29:28
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:29:35
And what does this page mean to you?

[P9] 12:29:38
It just wants you to check and make sure. You know, if you're unsure your answers, you could maybe click in those.

[P9] 12:29:47
Boxes, yes. And verify.

[P9] 12:29:52
There's everything is correct.

[Moderator] 12:29:54
Great.

[P9] 12:29:55
And then, then you go on down. Down there. And type in your name, that's like a.

[P9] 12:30:04
Kind of like a verification or a signature kind of thing. Saying that if you click this, you're telling the truth and.

[P9] 12:30:11
Everything looks correct and then you submit it.

[P9] 12:30:21
Oh, and it tells you immediately? Does it tell you for real?

[Moderator] 12:30:27
How do you feel about that?

[P9] 12:30:29
That is awesome. That is, that is way awesome.

[P9] 12:30:36
But this is just a prototype, so.

[P9] 12:30:41
But that would be cool. That would be cool because then you'd go right off the bat. Wouldn't have to sit and wait like I did wait a week thinking that everything's gonna be okay and then get your It's form sent back to you in the mail, you're not.

[P9] 12:30:59
Eligible yet because you haven't submitted this form this paperwork. It would let you know immediately that's.

[Moderator] 12:31:04
Yeah.

[P9] 12:31:07
That's nice.

[Moderator] 12:31:08
Yeah, I hear that. Yeah. And maybe taking a moment to read what else it says. Please let me know what your thoughts are.

[P9] 12:31:30
Wow, the payback. For certain amounts that you've already paid.

[P9] 12:31:47
Wow, that's nice. And it gives you the option to print the page. So that you have.

[P9] 12:31:51
Something proof in hand. To show that you submitted one. Because we all know that. Mistakes can be made.

[P9] 12:32:01
Maybe it got overlooked and you get billed in. That's pretty nice.

[P9] 12:32:16
Yeah, the only thing is, how long would you be eligible for? Do are you only eligible for the waiver for that?

[P9] 12:32:23
It's a particular bill that you click to begin with.

[Moderator] 12:32:29
Hmm, that's a great question. So.

[P9] 12:32:33
Would you have to submit this waiver every time you receive a bill?

[Moderator] 12:32:38
Right, so. So the the bills, the debts would be. Visible on that page that we saw in there you could select more than one.

[Moderator] 12:32:53
Right.

[P9] 12:32:54
Right. Well, I mean, in the future like If you're eligible for the, is it just gonna cover this bill or do you have to submit a waver every time you accrue new bills.

[Moderator] 12:33:08
Hmm, that's a great question. Yeah. What do you think is?

[Moderator] 12:33:17
What do you think actually?

[P9] 12:33:19
Well, I mean, if the person is on Social Security and they already have the financial. Like with me, they know what my financial statuses.

[P9] 12:33:34
I mean, I guess find your financial check status could change, but.

[Moderator] 12:33:39
Yeah, that's a great question.

[P9] 12:33:40
For me, I get medication bills every month. I mean, I guess happen to fill this little form out every month every time you get a bill.

[P9] 12:33:54
Wouldn't be bad, but. Some people's finances don't change. And mine don't change throughout the year.

[P9] 12:34:01
And I'm just, I don't know, I don't know.

[Moderator] 12:34:05
Yeah, that's a great point in a great question. I actually I'm not entirely sure.

[Moderator] 12:34:12
If If it's. A forum that you have to submit for every new. Bill or if it It's a time bound for a while, so I definitely want to check before.

[Moderator] 12:34:27
I answer your question, but. I do know that if you make this request for a debt that you selected on the previous page that it will address that.

[Moderator] 12:34:39
Bill or that, specifically. So yeah, but as for the other.

[P9] 12:34:45
I mean, it wouldn't be bad if you even if you had to, I mean, if, if you had that, you couldn't pay it.

[P9] 12:34:53
Filling out this form wouldn't be that. You know, it wouldn't be that. Difficult because it's a lot smaller.

[P9] 12:35:01
Lot less questions. And a lot less paperwork than the other form was.

[Moderator] 12:35:03
Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:35:07
Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. It's definitely an improvement. So now that we've gone through the form, I was wondering what was your overall experience with the form like?

[P9] 12:35:19
I like it. It was nice. It's much better than what it used to be. If they use, if they use this.
