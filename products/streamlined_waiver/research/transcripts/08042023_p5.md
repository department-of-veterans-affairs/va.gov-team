This interview today.

[P5] 12:09:28
Yes.

[Moderator] 12:09:29
Okay, great. Thank you. My next question is about your service in the military. Can you please tell me about the most important or memorable parts of your service?

[P5] 12:09:44
The most memorable part is the the friendships that I have made that have lasted for years like some of us don't, they haven't seen each other in forever.

[P5] 12:09:57
We just keep in touch over Facebook or Instagram. And it's been like 20 some years since I got out.

[P5] 12:10:02
So. To still have the common bond between us that's been really good.

[Moderator] 12:10:07
Wow, that's really wonderful. Those long lasting friendships, even after 20 plus years.

[P5] 12:10:13
Yes.

[Moderator] 12:10:14
That's really special. Thank you for sharing. So, in this next part, I want to share what we'll be talking about today.

[P5] 12:10:19
We love.

[Moderator] 12:10:25
So today I'll be taking you through a form to help with VA copay debt.

[Moderator] 12:10:30
And firstly, I'd like to briefly hear about your experiences with via copay debt. White has been your most recent experience.

[Moderator] 12:10:39
With VA.

[P5] 12:10:44
My billing for my physical therapy?

[P5] 12:10:48
Though I think it was in the air that they sent me to build, it was a lot of A lot of them.

[Moderator] 12:10:55
A lot of errors.

[P5] 12:10:59
Well, I guess a lot of bills. I guess to be able wasn't paying it in timely manner.

[P5] 12:11:04
Right, 20 or 30. Envelopes at one time.

[Moderator] 12:11:09
Oh wow.

[P5] 12:11:10
Yeah, that's been my most recent experience.

[Moderator] 12:11:14
Okay, that sounds like it must have been overwhelming. Was it, paper mail or, email that you received the notices?

[P5] 12:11:24
It was paper mail.

[Moderator] 12:11:26
Paper mail. And how long ago was that?

[P5] 12:11:32
Maybe. The last one that I received was maybe in April or May. But they started coming like since the new year.

[P5] 12:11:40
For bills from last year.

[Moderator] 12:11:41
Excellent. I see. Okay. And at this point, have, has it, has it been resolved yet or is it still in process?

[Moderator] 12:11:52
And being resolved.

[P5] 12:11:53
I don't know. I didn't get any more bills. So I hope it has.

[Moderator] 12:11:56
Okay. Okay, okay. Okay, great. So thank you for sharing that, that baseline for us to understand kind of.

[Moderator] 12:12:08
What, your situation has been with VA. In this next part of the interview, we're going to share a digital experience.

[Moderator] 12:12:19
And ask for your feedback. This is still an early version of this experience so i want you to know a few things first is that you'll be interacting with a prototype or a demo that will not work exactly the way you expect.

[Moderator] 12:12:35
Some areas of the prototype for demo will be clickable and some will not. And also some areas will be pre filled with fake information.

[P5] 12:12:41
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:12:46
So if it seems like some areas are confusing that's why because we've pre-filled some of the, sections already with fake information.

[P5] 12:12:55
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:12:55
Also, since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

[Moderator] 12:13:02
And finally, in this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback about the quality of your experience filling out this form if you were to feel that out in real life.

[Moderator] 12:13:12
Please remember to comment. On what is clear or unclear. And also please remember to think out loud.

[Moderator] 12:13:25
So I'm going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. And when you receive the link, please open the page and then I will.

[Moderator] 12:13:35
Try to help you navigate back to the zoom screen and share your screen.

[P5] 12:13:41
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:13:42
So, okay, let's see.

[Moderator] 12:13:48
Copying a link.

[Moderator] 12:13:54
And I just, sent the link in the Zoom chat. And you should have gotten a little notification.

[Moderator] 12:14:01
If you're able to click on that notification and click on the link, that would be great.

[P5] 12:14:08
Okay, I did.

[Moderator] 12:14:09
Great. And. Have you been able to open the link yet?

[P5] 12:14:15
Yes.

[Moderator] 12:14:16
Great. So now I'm going to ask that you go back to the Zoom screen so that we can.

[Moderator] 12:14:23
Screen share that web page.

[Moderator] 12:14:29
And are you able to go back to the Zoom screen?

[P5] 12:14:32
Yes.

[Moderator] 12:14:33
Great. So on the bottom of the screen, there should be 3 options, one in green that says share screen.

[Moderator] 12:14:45
Are you, are you able to find that button? Great. And when you, oh, great. Awesome.

[P5] 12:14:47
Yes.

[Moderator] 12:14:53
And so

[Moderator] 12:14:57
So now you've shared your desktop. Let me see,

[Moderator] 12:15:03
If you're able to navigate to the web page, oh, I see it. Perfect. Awesome.

[Moderator] 12:15:11
And I don't know if you're able to minimize my video just so that you're able to see the form.

[Moderator] 12:15:21
Maple to click on it and, sorry about that.

[P5] 12:15:29
No, let me.

[Moderator] 12:15:32
It won't.

[Moderator] 12:15:36
Let me see if I can. Help you. Try to minimize that.

[Moderator] 12:15:43
That's screen.

[Moderator] 12:16:02
If you try clicking just on my. Oh, that's a little better. That's great.

[P5] 12:16:08
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:16:08
Okay, I think that works. Are you able to see the the screen with the information, the web page.

[P5] 12:16:15
Yes.

[Moderator] 12:16:16
Okay, great. Awesome. Thank you for your patience with that. So today we're going to go through this form as I mentioned earlier and ask you to fill it out as you would normally.

[Moderator] 12:16:28
Since this is a demo, some of the information has been pre-filled with fake information.

[Moderator] 12:16:33
And imagine you navigated to this page because you want help with your VA copay debt. I'm gonna be observing silently and I'll ask you questions at certain times.

[Moderator] 12:16:44
Ii will also have some follow-up questions and please remember to think out loud as you're going through each page.

[P5] 12:16:52
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:16:52
So go ahead and get started whenever you're ready and you can also. Close that little notification. There we go.

[P5] 12:17:13
Is this a real thing? Like, is this something new or? You don't know.

[Moderator] 12:17:19
So there is a version of this that is live on v. Gov and after the end of the interview I can share that link with you.

[P5] 12:17:28
Oh, okay.

[Moderator] 12:17:28
If that would be but this specific web page is, not connected to your account in any way.

[P5] 12:17:37
Okay.

[P5] 12:17:42
Do you want me to request the help?

[Moderator] 12:17:45
Yep, go ahead and click there.

[Moderator] 12:18:07
I noticed on the previous page that you skipped ahead. And I was wondering why that is.

[P5] 12:18:09
Okay.

[P5] 12:18:15
They say start, help you start. Help me.

[Moderator] 12:18:19
Okay. Okay.

[P5] 12:18:22
And after I started reading down below where it was telling me what to do, I was like, oh.

[P5] 12:18:26
Sounds like normal stuff, so that's why I skip the head.

[Moderator] 12:18:30
Can you say a little bit more about that? Like it sounds like normal stuff.

[P5] 12:18:35
It always asks you all these questions to make sure you're in the right place. And, like when I'm standing up for a doctor's appointment or a

[Moderator] 12:18:40
Okay.

[P5] 12:18:50
Applying for a benefit inside of the app.

[P5] 12:18:56
They usually ask me the same question. Okay.

[Moderator] 12:19:00
And do you typically skip ahead? Of those sections.

[P5] 12:19:04
Yes.

[Moderator] 12:19:05
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:19:11
And why is that that you skip ahead typically?

[P5] 12:19:16
I use this skip ahead because I know it's coming or I know what it's going to say after I read like the first.

[P5] 12:19:21
1Â s, step in the process. Then I know it's the same thing I did before. And because I've been using it for a lot of years, I guess.

[Moderator] 12:19:24
Okay. Okay.

[Moderator] 12:19:30
Okay.

[P5] 12:19:34
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:19:38
So whenever you're ready you can go to the next page and please remember to comment and Anything that's clear and clear.

[Moderator] 12:19:46
Or anything that stands out.

[P5] 12:19:48
Okay.

[P5] 12:19:57
Does it matter which dead I choose or should I choose the both of the necks?

[Moderator] 12:20:01
Either one. You can. Choose both or just one.

[P5] 12:20:09
So inside it, it knows what that you have with the VA.

[Moderator] 12:20:14
That's, that's right.

[P5] 12:20:17
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:20:20
Have you seen this before on v.gov? Have you been able to see your debts?

[P5] 12:20:26
No, I didn't. If it's not, if it's community care, would it be in there?

[Moderator] 12:20:27
Okay.

[P5] 12:20:34
Because that's what those debts were that. It was community care, not. Inside the VA.

[Moderator] 12:20:38
So if it's not inside the VA, I believe it wouldn't be reflected here.

[P5] 12:20:44
Okay.

[P5] 12:20:48
Do you want me to continue or?

[Moderator] 12:20:49
Yes, please continue.

[P5] 12:21:01
Do you want me to update anything? On the.

[Moderator] 12:21:06
No, that's okay. We that's, you can keep, going continue.

[P5] 12:21:39
Do you want me to put the names in here too?

[Moderator] 12:21:42
Hmm. It's it.

[P5] 12:21:45
Well, I bet 3 and half the 2.

[P5] 12:21:49
Did that happen 3?

[Moderator] 12:21:50
Oh, I'm sorry, that's the limitation of the prototype. So we pre selected 3, but it would reflect only 2 here if you were actually in the live form.

[P5] 12:21:56
Oh.

[P5] 12:22:00
Okay.

[P5] 12:22:19
Yeah. Yes.

[P5] 12:23:01
Hey, Yeah.

[Moderator] 12:23:08
Oh.

[P5] 12:23:11
Oh, oh, sorry. I was. Going upon the amount. Should I just put in anything?

[Moderator] 12:23:15
Okay, you can put in anything but I'm curious what would you have done here with the calculator?

[P5] 12:23:24
Take my salary in divided by 12 to get the monthly amount.

[Moderator] 12:23:27
Okay, okay, thank you.

[Moderator] 12:23:49
And so here it would normally reflect. The selections you made. But because this is a limited demo.

[Moderator] 12:23:57
We've pre selected these different, payroll deductions.

[P5] 12:24:02
Yes.

[P5] 12:24:06
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:24:25
And how are you feeling at this point in the form?

[P5] 12:24:30
It's pretty self explanatory so far.

[P5] 12:24:36
I just wonder if.

[P5] 12:24:39
I don't know. How else do you get copays? I guess if you go to VA for everything.

[P5] 12:24:45
But I only go for my service connection. I guess this is for everybody. Well, in service connected or not, the copay part.

[Moderator] 12:24:55
You know, I'm not quite sure. I'll have to double check on that.

[Moderator] 12:25:02
I think if it's, I don't, I'm not totally sure. So I would, Yeah, probably ask.

[Moderator] 12:25:13
For in terms of how you get the it's a little bit different for everyone, I think, depending on maybe your.

[P5] 12:25:18
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:25:24
If you're fully got full disability or Yeah. I'm not, not quite sure.

[P5] 12:25:31
Okay.

[P5] 12:25:37
So here am I supposed to just verify that this stuff is mine?

[Moderator] 12:25:41
Yes, yep. So yes, and this is fake information.

[P5] 12:25:44
Okay. Okay.

[P5] 12:25:52
Other.

[P5] 12:25:56
It has nothing to say, none of these. Will they let me continue without clicking any of them?

[Moderator] 12:26:00
Hmm.

[Moderator] 12:26:04
It will actually, but that's a really good observation. Yeah. And it would be, would it be more helpful if there were an option that said none of these?

[P5] 12:26:17
Yes.

[Moderator] 12:26:28
I've noted that. So whenever you're ready, please click continue.

[Moderator] 12:26:39
And these have been pre selected.

[P5] 12:26:58
Earlier I said no spouse but it's still put them in here again. I guess it's just because of the prototype.

[Moderator] 12:27:05
Yes, that's right. So normally it wouldn't ask all the spouse questions if you said, no to the spouse question initially.

[P5] 12:27:21
And there's a low none on this one either.

[Moderator] 12:27:24
Right, yeah, that's a good observation again.

[P5] 12:27:36
One thing they required, and I don't have it, I just always put 0.

[P5] 12:27:42
Some things I put a PIN in if it won't take 0.

[P5] 12:27:53
So assets.

[Moderator] 12:27:59
So I wanted to ask you, what does cash on hand mean to you?

[P5] 12:28:05
Oh, what I have in my purse.

[Moderator] 12:28:07
Okay. And is this information that you would normally know off the top of your head?

[P5] 12:28:16
Yes, because I usually try not to have more than $100 a get but I keep it because one time I left my Debit card, my whole wallet like at home, and I had to go to the bank because I have my grandmother with me and we were back home.

[P5] 12:28:29
I went to Navy Federal and I don't know if anybody on the call has never, but they asked me to see as a question and gave me $50 out of my account.

[P5] 12:28:37
If I ask the questions correctly. So ever since then I try to keep some cash in my personal in my car somewhere.

[Moderator] 12:28:45
I see. Okay.

[P5] 12:28:50
Is that what it's asking? It said. Not in the bank. So that's why.

[Moderator] 12:28:55
You're absolutely right. Yep, that's what it's asking. Is a liquid cash.

[P5] 12:28:58
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:29:04
And what does this page mean to you?

[P5] 12:29:09
Is telling me that based on the numbers I guess that I put in. I'm eligible for a waiver.

[P5] 12:29:18
I don't know what the waver would be or maybe waving at the

[Moderator] 12:29:20
Waving of the. Okay. Okay.

[P5] 12:29:23
The

[Moderator] 12:29:42
And what does this page mean to you?

[P5] 12:29:47
Is like summarizing what I put in before. My information in my household.

[Moderator] 12:29:51
Okay.

[P5] 12:29:58
Then.

[P5] 12:30:01
Hello, I'm not what I said is true.

[P5] 12:30:19
And if I wanted to, I could click on the privacy policy, but, I've read it so many times.

[Moderator] 12:30:25
You've already, what do, what do you click the privacy policy in this form?

[P5] 12:30:30
No, I said, but if I hadn't done this before, I would. If I had used the VA.

[Moderator] 12:30:31
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:30:35
Okay.

[P5] 12:30:40
Website before.

[Moderator] 12:30:42
Gotcha. That makes sense.

[P5] 12:30:55
Yes, so that is what it is. They'll forgive part of it.

[P5] 12:31:02
I didn't know about such a thing.

[Moderator] 12:31:09
You said you didn't know about such a thing. Sounds like this is maybe new or surprising.

[P5] 12:31:18
Yeah, I I've never known about this but it's a lot of things I don't know about the VA.

[P5] 12:31:25
Talk to people. It's like not in a book somewhere.

[Moderator] 12:31:28
And how do you feel about this page?

[P5] 12:31:33
Is telling me? How about a Weber was I didn't even know I was going in it to get a waver, so that's good.

[P5] 12:31:43
That are eligible for one but it doesn't tell me how much of a waiver. It just is part of the unpaid debt.

[P5] 12:31:52
And then, yeah, I just wait.

[P5] 12:31:59
To see which one of these or both of these gets approved.

[P5] 12:32:06
I don't use the print pages, I use the screenshot stuff and put it in a folder on my phone.

[Moderator] 12:32:10
I see. Okay.

[Moderator] 12:32:15
And so now that we've gone through this experience, this form, what was your overall experience with the form like?

[P5] 12:32:24
It was easy to navigate. Excuse me, it didn't ask a lot of questions and it was quick.

[P5] 12:32:31
Some pages take you outside of the VA then back into the VA system. Like logging in and logging back out.

[Moderator] 12:32:43
And you remember a form where it does that?

[P5] 12:32:48
I wanna say I used to do that when I still apply for the GI Bill when I used to do the GI, but that was a while ago.

[P5] 12:32:56
Like I will log in to VA.gov. It wasn't on any benefits then though.

[Moderator] 12:33:01
I see.

[P5] 12:33:02
And then it would take me to another site and then back into the VA. Well, it lets me know that all less money I just don't know how much yet

[Moderator] 12:33:08
Hmm, I see. Interesting. And how do you feel about this outcome where it says you're eligible for a waiver?

[Moderator] 12:33:23
Right, right. Right. What would you change if anything about the form?

[P5] 12:33:37
Maybe if it asked me. How much I could pay that could? Be one thing.

[Moderator] 12:33:46
Yeah. And why?

[P5] 12:33:48
Or if it had a reason why I can't pay. If there was somewhere to put that.

[Moderator] 12:33:52
When you say a reason why you can't pay, do you imagine something where you could write something or

[P5] 12:34:00
Yeah, like a paragraph, like, my children are both in college and I don't really have any disposable income or something like that.

[Moderator] 12:34:08
I see. Okay. That's great feedback. Great.

[Moderator] 12:34:14
So. In this last part of the interview, I am going to ask that you use your arrow or actually you can probably swipe.

[Moderator] 12:34:25
Forward to the next page. Because we have one last thing. No, actually I want you to go to the next page.

[P5] 12:34:28
You had the

[Moderator] 12:34:33
But in order to do that, I think you'd have to probably either tap. On this page or try to swipe.

[Moderator] 12:34:41
Towards the left. So let's try that.

[P5] 12:34:45
Nope.

[Moderator] 12:34:48
Neither one works. Let me.

[Moderator] 12:34:53
Ask.

[Moderator] 12:35:02
Just asking one of my team mates.

[P5] 12:35:08
Okay, excuse me. I'm sorry, I think it's my allergy to something.

[Moderator] 12:35:11
Oh. Oh, would you like to take a break? Or get some water.

[P5] 12:35:16
Oh no no no, I have something to drink. And I've been taking these minutes.

[Moderator] 12:35:22
Well, if you want to take a break or grab some water, please let me know. There's no No problem at all.

[Moderator] 12:35:29
So I'm gonna share the link with you, so that that we can navigate to that page.

[Moderator] 12:35:38
And just one moment, thank you for your patience while I. Find that page.

[P5] 12:35:44
No problem. Thank you.

[Moderator] 12:35:47
Okay. Okay.

[Moderator] 12:35:53
Oh, actually, Maybe you can try the print this page button. So that we can take you to.

[Moderator] 12:36:01
The other page.

[P5] 12:36:04
On the chat.

[Moderator] 12:36:06
No, sorry, on, on the web page. So what you were seeing earlier where it said print this page.

[Moderator] 12:36:13
If you click there, it'll take you to. The next section of the interview.

[P5] 12:36:19
Is not doing anything.

[Moderator] 12:36:21
Oh, can you please try refreshing the page?

[Moderator] 12:36:31
Yeah, great. Now it works. So this is the page that you skipped. And so We have 2 versions of this page.

[Moderator] 12:36:39
It's an introduction page. So what I would like you to do is look at this. This page and then the next page.

[Moderator] 12:36:51
To, let me actually see if you'll be able to navigate to the next page.

[P5] 12:37:03
You want me to click?

[Moderator] 12:37:06
I'm asking my, teammate if, So the whole page is clickable.

[Moderator] 12:37:12
So yes, you can click anywhere and it'll show you the second version that we're considering.

[P5] 12:37:16
Okay.

[Moderator] 12:37:21
But maybe just review this page and. Just notice everything it says.

[Moderator] 12:37:36
When you're done doing this page, please tap anywhere on this page.

[Moderator] 12:37:54
And so this is the second version. Of the intro page and take a moment to look at this.

[Moderator] 12:38:01
Right.

[Moderator] 12:38:32
And based on the first and the second one you've seen, which version would be best for you?

[P5] 12:38:43
This one here, it seems more. Consolidated.

[Moderator] 12:38:48
We're consolidated. Okay, great.

[P5] 12:38:52
I think on the other one I saw it was like a list and then I told you explanation of why they asked them for that.

[P5] 12:38:58
Of each name. This one just has what they want.
