[Moderator] 14:16:40
Have to ask once more are you okay with me recording this interview today?

[P12] 14:16:44
Yes, I'm okay with it.

[Moderator] 14:16:46
Great. Thank you so much. Okay, so. My next question is about your service in the military.

[Moderator] 14:16:54
Can you please tell me about the most important or memorable or meaningful parts of your service?

[P12] 14:17:02
Yeah, I went in when I was 19. I got out at 21. You know, I would say that I had the mind of a 16 year old when I went in really young and didn't know much.

[P12] 14:17:13
So my time was pretty difficult. Just because I feel like I wasn't ready to go in.

[Moderator] 14:17:20
Hmm.

[P12] 14:17:24
Yeah, what would I say?

[P12] 14:17:27
You know sometimes I mean I don't know what's most memorable. But I know that, when people, like other young ladies will ask me about.

[P12] 14:17:36
If they should join or not, I definitely, consider like if I know the young woman where they are emotionally and in sure wise.

[P12] 14:17:45
Where they where they are because I do feel like the military is a very predatory place and. If you don't, if you're not kind of.

[P12] 14:17:56
She just don't have a, I don't know, as a woman I just think you should be careful if you're going in.

[P12] 14:18:01
But I think That's party the most memorable part is that I feel like it was very of a predatory place and I think I mean to say and it was just very challenging emotionally and.

[P12] 14:18:16
Being in a world of adults and I felt like looking back I very much was a child. Trying to just sort of try to survive and I wasn't ready going.

[Moderator] 14:18:28
Thank you for sharing that. That sounds like it must have been a really difficult time, especially being so young, as you mentioned.

[Moderator] 14:18:35
And being in a really kind of really different world, a different environment. I appreciate you sharing with me.

[P12] 14:18:43
Yeah.

[Moderator] 14:18:45
So now to the next part of the interview, just to introduce what we'll be talking about today, I'll be taking you through a form to help with the copay debt.

[Moderator] 14:18:57
And firstly I'd like to briefly hear about your experience, your experiences with the copay debt.

[Moderator] 14:19:02
What has been your most recent experience with that with VA copay

[P12] 14:19:06
Yeah, I

[P12] 14:19:13
I was in school still and I don't even remember what exactly what it was for, but I remember I accumulated a certain amount of debt.

[P12] 14:19:22
Because of the medical, I believe. And to my understanding. What? It was kind of a while ago, but they end up just started, they started taking it out of my disability.

[P12] 14:19:37
I think like it kind of went I didn't pay it in a while so they just started taking it out.

[Moderator] 14:19:43
Hmm.

[P12] 14:19:43
A disability that's what i remember i don't remember exactly what it was for but i believe it was medical i went to the hospital and I didn't realize I had that.

[P12] 14:19:53
And so I got a lot of email and that's how they ended up paying for it.

[Moderator] 14:19:57
Okay, so it sounds like they took the money out of your disability benefits. And then with Sorry.

[P12] 14:20:02
Yeah. You remember that. That's all I remember. About it.

[Moderator] 14:20:08
Okay, no problem. That's a good context for us to know. Thank you for sharing.

[P12] 14:20:09
I'm sorry.

[Moderator] 14:20:15
So next in this next part of the interview, I'm going to share a digital experience that we're working on and ask for your feedback.

[Moderator] 14:20:23
And there are a few things I want you to know. You'll be interacting with a prototype that will not work exactly the way you expect.

[Moderator] 14:20:30
So it's a limited prototype in some areas of the prototype will be clickable and some will not.

[Moderator] 14:20:36
Also some areas of the prototype have been pre-filled with fake information. And since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA, information or benefits.

[Moderator] 14:20:48
And in this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback about the quality of your experience filling out the form if you were to fill it out.

[Moderator] 14:20:57
Please remembering to think out loud as you go through it and comment on anything that is clear and anything that is unclear.

[Moderator] 14:21:04
And, and then I'm going to drop the, a link in the zoom chat for you to open.

[Moderator] 14:21:10
Are you joining on mobile or desktop or iPad today?

[P12] 14:21:15
What is this? This is a, I think a Window thing.

[Moderator] 14:21:20
So is it a laptop or? Okay, great. So I will be dropping the link in the Zoom chat in just a moment.

[P12] 14:21:22
Oh yeah, it's a laptop.

[P12] 14:21:29
Okay.

[P12] 14:21:33
Get over this video, not working.

[Moderator] 14:21:40
And I just dropped the link in the Zoom chat and whenever you're ready please go ahead and open it.

[P12] 14:21:47
Okay.

[P12] 14:21:51
I don't see anything in my chat.

[Moderator] 14:21:56
Oh, let's see.

[P12] 14:21:59
Oh, I see it now. Just kidding. Huh. Oh, I need to share my screen, right?

[Moderator] 14:22:01
Oh great.

[Moderator] 14:22:07
Yes, would, let me know if you want me to, walk you through how to do that.

[P12] 14:22:21
You see me? Or? Hmm. Yes.

[Moderator] 14:22:22
Yes, wonderful. Thank you. Great. So, I'll be observing silently.

[Moderator] 14:22:29
And I'll ask you questions at certain times. And just remembering to think out loud as you go through the form.

[Moderator] 14:22:37
And go ahead and click proceed.

[P12] 14:22:40
Okay. Let's see.

[P12] 14:22:48
Bye.

[Moderator] 14:22:48
So, imagine you navigated to this page because you want help with your via.

[P12] 14:22:53
Okay, so far. Request help with the debt for overpayments and copay bills. I like the phone, I like how big it is and I like that you have the VA form.

[P12] 14:23:06
On the bottom. So let's say I imagine that people sometimes get forms, they might get this form.

[P12] 14:23:12
DVF, 3,600, and 55 in the mail. And, old people sometimes are unsure about things.

[P12] 14:23:18
So I like that you have that form if there if something is sent in the. Mail, but now they can do it online.

[P12] 14:23:28
Request help with the form that looks like something that I can press and that it would take me to another page.

[P12] 14:23:34
So I imagine. That if I want to fill it out. On paper that that would take me to a link.

[P12] 14:23:41
That's what I'm imagining. This is the form that I need. This forms for veterans or service.

[P12] 14:23:48
And you help with that related to the available payments. No. You know, it's not, we'll buy you to best way to help him.

[P12] 14:23:54
Go to the phone now. I think, I'm not confused, but I guess as I'm on this page, I imagine I got something on the page, I imagine I got something on the, in the mail.

[P12] 14:24:04
In that. I don't know, I guess I'm a slightly confused, but maybe it's because I currently don't have one of these.

[P12] 14:24:12
But I got something in in the mail, but okay. So maybe this is not actually. I guess I'm realizing this is not.

[P12] 14:24:20
How I would pay on the VA website, but just more get help. My mind. Yeah. So Is, to.

[Moderator] 14:24:26
Yeah. Great feedback. Thank you.

[P12] 14:24:31
So I press that one, okay. What do you, I like the different options.

[P12] 14:24:41
But I, what if it's like education? So I don't know if that tech program is that, but.

[P12] 14:24:47
Okay, education, I see it's right there.

[P12] 14:24:51
I don't know if I feel like education should be its own because chapter 31 30 is not the same as disability but

[P12] 14:24:59
Whatever.

[Moderator] 14:25:00
Have you seen one of these before where you can click different options and then it tells you. If this is the rate.

[Moderator] 14:25:08
Product for you or the right form.

[P12] 14:25:11
And other scenarios like this when I've done the whatever this thing is called that I'm doing.

[P12] 14:25:19
Sometimes they'll have, but usually it's highlighted, you know, they'll be a blue link.

[P12] 14:25:23
So that I can be like it. There's something that, alerts my mind of, okay, let's see, I press it, but it's like a blue or underlined thing.

[P12] 14:25:33
But with this, I feel like, okay, I'm just hoping. That this is the right one.

[P12] 14:25:40
So what do you want to do for this debt? I don't know if I liked.

[P12] 14:25:44
I don't know if I like that wording. I don't know. You would word it, but.

[P12] 14:25:49
I don't know. It's okay though. But I like the options though, you know, asked to be to reconsider the.

[Moderator] 14:25:50
Yeah, I see what you mean.

[P12] 14:25:58
I like that. Request debt relief. Report and error. We cost the extended monthly payment plan.

[P12] 14:26:11
Request a debt relief.

[P12] 14:26:15
Oh, we have a compromise offer.

[Moderator] 14:26:20
Okay.

[P12] 14:26:20
I don't know if I, okay.

[P12] 14:26:25
I guess in my mind where is Is the request that relief is that the same thing as the waiver request?

[P12] 14:26:32
Not the same thing, but it's like. Requesting a debt relief is at a waiver request.

[P12] 14:26:38
That makes sense.

[P12] 14:26:40
Okay. I guess I see that it's in parentheses a waiver or compromise offer.

[Moderator] 14:26:43
Yeah.

[Moderator] 14:26:50
Yep, that's right.

[P12] 14:26:50
I guess it's just saying it multiple different ways. One thing I don't have.

[P12] 14:26:55
Okay, anyways, I guess I like that. It confused me in the moment, but I understand now.

[Moderator] 14:27:01
What's specifically about that sentence is was confusing, like which word or

[P12] 14:27:06
Yeah, so I think, a lot of times, which is what I'm doing now, I don't fully read thoroughly, right?

[Moderator] 14:27:14
Right.

[P12] 14:27:14
Most people I feel like don't read early. They're just like looking for the right thing.

[P12] 14:27:18
And so. And me not exactly know what I'm looking for, request that relief. And then it says ask me to consider the decision on my waiver request.

[P12] 14:27:25
I know what a wave of request is, but it doesn't say, I guess I in my mind.

[P12] 14:27:31
It should it's 2 separate things. I don't have, so it's like, but then you have in parentheses, but I didn't read fully.

[Moderator] 14:27:34
Hmm.

[P12] 14:27:39
So then I guess I was trying to understand what I should. Like is that the same thing? But I do see a waiver.

[P12] 14:27:48
Or compromise offer.

[Moderator] 14:27:51
Yeah, I can see.

[P12] 14:27:52
Maybe I would prefer, but you know, I might would prefer actually. In my mind, I don't know.

[P12] 14:27:59
Is that if there was a link to say what is a debt rate like I know what a debt relief is but then if you had a description and it would kind of explain it is a waiver a request for a waiver in order to not you know pay the remainder of your debt.

[Moderator] 14:28:17
Something more detailed with the explanation.

[P12] 14:28:20
I guess because it's so many so many words but I mean I do understand and then I guess just the next line being it worded differently with confidence.

[Moderator] 14:28:30
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Thank you for calling that out.

[P12] 14:28:31
It's called a waiver request, but then why did you call something different? It.

[Moderator] 14:28:37
That's a really good observation. And when you're ready, please go to the next page.

[P12] 14:28:39
Yeah.

[P12] 14:28:44
Oh, okay. How do I go to the next stage?

[Moderator] 14:28:49
So if you wanted to submit this form, where would you?

[P12] 14:28:58
You know, the thing about this, this is why I think this page is a little confusing. Is there anything on this side?

[P12] 14:29:05
No. Okay. What I find confusing is that I'm answering all these questions. But it's not.

[P12] 14:29:13
I'm not paying. I know it's his request help. So I guess I go to the to the top request help.

[P12] 14:29:24
I think this answers. Let me use my clicker thing. I think this if this is what I press after I finish this and this should be at the bottom because but then this isn't a yellow box so that I'm like, okay, well.

[P12] 14:29:36
Is this different? Basically. I guess this is what I'm.

[P12] 14:29:42
Pressing but then the The title of this page is Request Help. So then it to me it should say this.

[P12] 14:29:51
But then what is this?

[Moderator] 14:29:51
Hmm. Right, I can see that they seem like 2 different. 2 different links.

[P12] 14:29:57
So I'm not sure if I'm pressing this or if I'm actually pressing.

[P12] 14:30:01
Yeah.

[Moderator] 14:30:03
Go ahead and click on, either one. Actually, they, they take you to the same place, but I can see how that's Confusing because they're worried differently.

[Moderator] 14:30:14
Just take a moment to look at this page.

[P12] 14:30:17
We can request based on your account. I wouldn't even finish you and then I'm like, okay, that means nothing to me.

[P12] 14:30:25
Start by This guys, I'm welcome like this is very confusing to me. If you think this is because I don't know what.

[P12] 14:30:33
So this is just the extension to requesting help with VA debt for over payments and co-payments.

[P12] 14:30:40
I don't know, you know, if If I went back to the last page. Can I go back to the last page real quick?

[Moderator] 14:30:45
Yes, you can. Absolutely.

[P12] 14:30:46
So, bye. I kind of like so after I fill this out, what am I expecting? Let me think.

[P12] 14:30:54
I just kind of want to go over that because it was the step related to what do you want for this?

[P12] 14:31:01
I don't even know what I would expect. But I guess, cause it's just so many different things.

[P12] 14:31:06
I think even just the next page. I'm like, what is this? Because I don't even, I think.

[P12] 14:31:11
You asked me so many questions that like whether I want a way where I wanna pay, like why would they even lead to the same thing?

[P12] 14:31:19
I don't even know. The amount of questions. You can have my mind. Going somewhere.

[Moderator] 14:31:22
Hmm.

[P12] 14:31:27
If anything, I think. If I'm asking. For one thing, I might, depending on one question, it would lead me to a new set of questions.

[P12] 14:31:37
So I almost think that this. And almost this and this is I know that I know they're related.

[P12] 14:31:43
But now you're asking me, do I wanna make a payment? So. I don't need it.

[P12] 14:31:47
I just don't even know what this page would be. I don't know what it is.

[P12] 14:31:51
If I'm gonna read it and I'm gonna find out. Anything for you, go back and answer questions again.

[P12] 14:31:58
Prepare you'll need to see this information

[P12] 14:32:08
Let me go back really quick. I'm sorry. Let me figure out what I'm getting help for.

[P12] 14:32:12
Oh yeah, the co payments. Okay, that relief. Okay. Sorry, now I know.

[P12] 14:32:19
Maybe I'm just out of touch. It could be that.

[Moderator] 14:32:21
This is really great feedback. Anything you see that's confusing or doesn't make sense to you, please, please do let me know.

[P12] 14:32:30
I think I'm just trying to, together because I think I was looking at What, request, I think maybe I forgot what requests I was looking for.

[P12] 14:32:39
So I guess. Now that I know that I'm looking for I had. A debt for.

[P12] 14:32:48
Medical, I believe, and then I'm wanting them to reconsider or I want debt relief. If I'm remembering correctly, so it's saying, okay.

[P12] 14:32:58
This is how you this is what you need in order to start your request. And I guess right here is how I would officially go forward.

[P12] 14:33:06
And that, that's what I'm thinking. Okay, you guys tell me we wanna make sure we are, if you're made, and you're gonna show your thoughts kind of situation, this helps us.

[P12] 14:33:15
Okay.

[P12] 14:33:18
Okay, so I understand this. It's just letting me know in order to officially. Put in my official request right here.

[P12] 14:33:30
I need these things. It's telling me why. Then I'll submit it. And then it's tell me what's gonna happen.

[P12] 14:33:35
Okay, so can I press this now or no?

[Moderator] 14:33:37
Yep, go ahead.

[P12] 14:33:43
Okay, okay, I see why you guys Just wanna go back really quick.

[P12] 14:33:51
I feel like this part right here. Should be in the next part, but I guess. I could see why to my page too.

[P12] 14:34:01
Bye, I guess, maybe it makes sense.

[Moderator] 14:34:04
Yeah, you can imagine you would have logged in at that point.

[P12] 14:34:08
Okay, yeah, I like the way this page looks so I like I always like these little boxes letting me know how many.

[P12] 14:34:16
I don't know, I like that there's a visual like picture and then you actually have the words.

[P12] 14:34:23
I like that a lot.

[Moderator] 14:34:24
And what do you think the boxes mean?

[P12] 14:34:27
I imagine that it's 7 of them. Yeah, so it's step one out of 7.

[P12] 14:34:33
So you have the visual representation, then you have the words. I like that a lot and I like that it's bold our year.

[Moderator] 14:34:35
Hey.

[P12] 14:34:40
I like that the name and the steps are bold. I like this. I like, I like this page and I like that you have this option for.

[P12] 14:34:48
Finish this request later. Some people like I'm tired. No, do it later.

[P12] 14:34:55
I'm gonna press continue if you're okay with that.

[Moderator] 14:34:57
Yes. Go ahead. Thank you.

[P12] 14:35:02
Okay, so I'm still on step one.

[P12] 14:35:07
So this person has more than one.

[P12] 14:35:11
So can I press both of them? Okay, I like that.

[P12] 14:35:21
Okay, I should be okay. I'm sorry.

[Moderator] 14:35:24
Oh, no problem.

[P12] 14:35:26
Okay.

[P12] 14:35:33
Okay, I like that you have this. One of my debt isn't listed.

[P12] 14:35:38
I like this part. I like all of this.

[P12] 14:35:45
I wouldn't be upset also. I mean, this is just extra, not that it's really.

[P12] 14:35:50
A must or anything? But if you could like press it and have the address there. Like what if it was in a city, they don't remember the name of the hospital, but they knew what city it was in because they drove there.

[Moderator] 14:35:57
Hmm.

[Moderator] 14:36:07
And that would be helpful. For you to remember which place it was in.

[P12] 14:36:12
Yeah, cause sometimes I go to offices and I don't remember which office it is, especially if there's multiple ones.

[Moderator] 14:36:17
I see.

[P12] 14:36:18
Let's say veteran had like you know, maybe they had a dentist appointment and they had a foot doctor then like a mental health thing and but it didn't actually say it so they don't know which one it is, but it has the address.

[P12] 14:36:32
So maybe that could be helpful. I don't know.

[Moderator] 14:36:35
That's a great idea.

[P12] 14:36:38
I'm gonna press continue if that's okay.

[Moderator] 14:36:39
Okay, yes, please go ahead and click continue.

[P12] 14:36:43
Okay, so still step one. I like that. Once again, I just like that visual representation. Contact information.

[P12] 14:36:51
Okay. So to me that this should be. Second. I think it's weird that.

[P12] 14:36:59
You went from like. So it's like veteran information. Well, shoot, I don't know, happened.

[P12] 14:37:06
Maybe.

[Moderator] 14:37:07
Oh, sorry about that. That might be the prototype, but I see, I see what you're saying.

[P12] 14:37:10
Oh. Yeah. Like better information.

[Moderator] 14:37:12
Yeah, having it right here.

[Moderator] 14:37:14
Yeah.

[P12] 14:37:16
To like something that seems.

[P12] 14:37:20
Like not personal information, it's more about the claim or whatever back to person contact information. I don't.

[Moderator] 14:37:27
I see. Yeah, that that would make more more logical sense. And when you're ready. When you're ready, please click continue.

[P12] 14:37:32
Yeah, but I do like this. Huh?

[P12] 14:37:36
Okay.

[Moderator] 14:37:41
And you can use fake information here if you'd like.

[P12] 14:37:45
Okay. Okay. I like that page is fine too.

[P12] 14:37:54
Okay. I like the US have this who qualifies as a dependent. I like that. Yeah, that's a long step one.

[P12] 14:38:06
Yeah.

[Moderator] 14:38:06
How do you feel about that? The progress bar being still at step one.

[P12] 14:38:16
I wasn't expecting it to be this long. Which is why I like to finish this request later.

[P12] 14:38:22
I don't necessarily like, I can't imagine what is down these when you guys are asking these specific questions.

[P12] 14:38:28
This seems to kind of. The more step 2. But I mean, I guess I don't know if I say it matters that much.

[P12] 14:38:36
I feel like Just my basic information would be here and this is for Kind of more like a step 2, but And as well as that second page line.

[P12] 14:38:46
I said I feel like it's a little all over the place a little bit. This seems to be more than just my contact information.

[P12] 14:38:52
Like. This is a little bit to me like a step 2 thing, but. You know.

[P12] 14:39:02
Not a huge deal.

[P12] 14:39:12
Okay, let's see. This is the disability compensation. Hello.

[Moderator] 14:39:21
And these are just example amounts so it would reflect your actual benefits.

[P12] 14:39:26
What would I edit? Can I press this?

[P12] 14:39:33
Okay.

[P12] 14:39:37
Okay. I don't understand.

[P12] 14:39:43
I don't understand the numbers, but it is protested. Okay. Okay, I like that.

[P12] 14:39:50
I like the way you have it in different boxes. I like that a lot. So this page looks really good to me.

[P12] 14:39:59
Oh, your other income. Okay. So far, let me go back really quick. Household and, benefits.

[P12] 14:40:09
Okay. And then it's asking me about other income. So far I really like step 2. Just the setup and the progression of it.

[P12] 14:40:17
Oh

[Moderator] 14:40:18
When you say you really like step 2, what do you specifically like about it?

[P12] 14:40:21
I just think the progression is what I would expect. Step one, it was like. It didn't really make so much sense to me but so far I like that you guys said this is what we have you in right now and then you asked me if I had I think if I had other income if I had a job I said no.

[Moderator] 14:40:24
Okay.

[P12] 14:40:38
Okay, do you have any other income if I was Single mom getting that child support didn't work.

[P12] 14:40:45
Yeah, I like I just think that the progression is what I would expect.

[Moderator] 14:40:51
Awesome.

[P12] 14:40:51
I like all the options that you gave. I thought, it was, you know, a lot of options that should cover.

[P12] 14:40:59
You know, most things. So I liked it.

[P12] 14:41:04
Okay.

[Moderator] 14:41:06
And you can imagine here it would reflect what you actually selected, but due to the limitations, we've pre selected these.

[P12] 14:41:09
Good. Okay.

[Moderator] 14:41:13
Fields.

[P12] 14:41:13
Alright, oops. Okay, yeah, I like that by the way as well. This makes sense to me.

[P12] 14:41:22
Alright, I like this too a lot.

[P12] 14:41:26
I just like and I like that I can edit it as well and that it's separate boxes.

[P12] 14:41:31
I just can appreciate. This like the brain can simply understand it. And if I messed up, I can.

[Moderator] 14:41:39
Yeah.

[P12] 14:41:41
And then II really like that option too. Right here, it just makes it easier rather than having to go back.

[P12] 14:41:49
You know, sometimes when people go back, the computer can mess up or they're closely gonna save.

[P12] 14:41:53
But nope, I don't have to worry about that. I can easily just pick up, need to add another one or oh, I gotta edit it or.

[P12] 14:42:00
I don't wanna tell them, I delete it, I really like.

[Moderator] 14:42:04
Great, And so here we pre selected this but normally it would skip this section because you said no.

[P12] 14:42:13
Okay, should I say no?

[Moderator] 14:42:13
Yes. That's fine. Yeah, you can say no.

[P12] 14:42:17
Okay, and you know likewise I like this too.

[P12] 14:42:23
Now see, this is where I would say finish this request later. But, Just be tired.

[Moderator] 14:42:28
Why is that?

[P12] 14:42:30
I think in my mind this wasn't gonna be so long of a process. I mean, not you and not us in real life, but.

[P12] 14:42:38
But I think if I'm filling it out, I think I probably would have thought it would have been, cause I'm only requesting help.

[P12] 14:42:44
So this is why or no, I'm requesting. This is why I don't know if I think that this is the best.

[P12] 14:42:52
Title and maybe kind of deceived me. I think it's more than just help. Like if I'm just asking for help, it's like, okay, chat with someone call.

[P12] 14:43:04
But you guys are like, I can pay online. I can request debt relief. I can ask for I'm an extension.

[P12] 14:43:12
I don't think maybe that's where the confusion came from is that this doesn't really.

[P12] 14:43:17
Describe what I'm doing on this page. I think great though. I think.

[Moderator] 14:43:22
Yeah, I can see that. Is there a different word you would use besides request help?

[P12] 14:43:29
Oh

[P12] 14:43:34
I'd have to think.

[Moderator] 14:43:37
No worries. Yeah, II can see where, what you mean though with that seeming like.

[P12] 14:43:39
Hmm. Hmm.

[Moderator] 14:43:44
You might like call someone or.

[P12] 14:43:47
Yeah, I think this really is like a management like like you said, manager VA. I think that's what This really is and I think in the beginning I was a what's happening here.

[P12] 14:43:58
I think that's kind of where the confusion is, but now that I'm in it, I'm like, oh, I'm managing and I can take care of all my VA.

[P12] 14:44:06
Over payments co-payments here and just overall management. And so I do like it though. I think now my mind has caught up to what.

[P12] 14:44:15
We're doing. Type of work. Let's see. Oh, I like that.

[P12] 14:44:20
These are all the great options. Let me choose something. Let's say seasonal. See.

[P12] 14:44:29
Let's say now.

[P12] 14:44:33
Okay, I'll need IRS type of information or FASFA. Okay. I just keep going.

[P12] 14:44:40
Okay. And see.

[P12] 14:44:48
Oh wow, where's the payload deduction? This is a lot of information that I.

[P12] 14:44:55
Do you all really need this? But, if you guys do. Can you do multiple things?

[P12] 14:45:00
Oh! That you can. I wonder if I did other what happened?

[P12] 14:45:07
I don't know. Okay. I'm just not gonna Say anything here, but I like this as well.

[P12] 14:45:15
This makes sense to me. How much is it? That's a lot of information. I don't know if you really need that, but.

[Moderator] 14:45:15
Hmm.

[P12] 14:45:23
If I was really filling this out. I'd be annoyed. I would, cause I mean.

[Moderator] 14:45:27
You'd be annoyed.

[P12] 14:45:31
I mean, I'm not married, but. Hi, I imagine that I wouldn't know the amount.

[P12] 14:45:36
For my spouse to like. And I feel like people don't usually know that information. But, if you all really need it, then you'll really need it.

[P12] 14:45:50
And I once again, I like the edit delete. And then they add the option to.

[P12] 14:45:55
Go back without actually pressing back, but just to move forward and kind of take me back to that page.

[P12] 14:46:01
Okay, I'm not gonna lie. Wasn't you really want all the information in the world?

[P12] 14:46:05
But understand I thought it was gonna go to step 3. I'm gonna say no, but this does make sense.

[P12] 14:46:11
I think this probably probably be easier. Matter of fact, I'm gonna say yes.

[P12] 14:46:17
Wow. I rather an option. I don't even know if this is possible. Because this is exhausting.

[P12] 14:46:29
I definitely would be finishing this later. But if they're, I mean, I guess this is probably you can't, but if you could put in.

[P12] 14:46:39
I don't know if this is even a thing.

[P12] 14:46:43
I'm just gonna say though, sorry, I know we're on a time but if you could put in their social security and then them look it up.

[P12] 14:46:52
And that way, cause I think if you're married and within the VA, you're Things can be connected.

[Moderator] 14:46:52
Hmm.

[P12] 14:47:00
So if you're asking me for like, VA benefits and you have in the system that you're together.

[P12] 14:47:07
I don't know if you can link it, but that means there's 2 veterans. But I know that could be weird with, you know, private data and stuff.

[P12] 14:47:16
I'm not saying it pulls up, but.

[Moderator] 14:47:17
That's a great suggestion. Yeah, we're Thank you for that. Right.

[P12] 14:47:20
They don't have to put in yourself, but they can look it up and it just connect later on afterwards.

[P12] 14:47:25
I don't know. But

[Moderator] 14:47:25
Yeah. So I'll ask you to, skip ahead a few questions, just in light of the time.

[P12] 14:47:31
Okay.

[Moderator] 14:47:34
So go ahead and click continue.

[Moderator] 14:47:38
And please pause here. And please read this question.

[P12] 14:47:41
Hi, telling you all that. Get out of my face. I'm not telling you all this.

[P12] 14:47:47
No, I'm not. Veterans are not gonna tell you this. I think this is Loki hilarious.

[P12] 14:47:55
I'm walking away. I'm sorry. I don't know if they need this information.

[P12] 14:47:58
No one's gonna be honest, so. Wait, I'm sorry if I'm being like not sensitive.

[Moderator] 14:48:01
No, this is this is great feedback. I'm just listening. Oh, not at all.

[P12] 14:48:04
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry for being offensive. You guys, I don't even know who created this program.

[Moderator] 14:48:09
No, no. Great, and absolutely we're listening to everything you share and definitely we're asking for your honest feedback and definitely we're asking for your honest feedback and your honest reaction.

[Moderator] 14:48:20
So, yes, thank you.

[P12] 14:48:23
I think household assets are fine but no one's gonna say cash on hand. But I think that household assets is Let me see what else.

[P12] 14:48:32
Oh, that's all you guys ask. I don't even know.

[Moderator] 14:48:33
And what does cash on hand mean to you?

[P12] 14:48:37
Hi, if I open my drawer and I save money in cash, I got 50 stacks. Like that's what I'm imagining what you guys are asking me.

[P12] 14:48:47
What what kind of cash do I have on hand if I have a lockbox or something in the house?

[Moderator] 14:48:51
Okay. Okay.

[P12] 14:48:52
That's what I imagine you guys are asking. But if I'm trying to get a waver, I'm gonna make it seem like I have the least amount of money on hand anyway, so.

[P12] 14:49:00
If they can be tracked, I'm not gonna say it. That's why I have to I think about this question, even though half full assets are fine.

[P12] 14:49:11
Like what if your car is paid off for and that's like an asset. I don't know, maybe no, that's that I guess so.

[Moderator] 14:49:15
Hmm.

[P12] 14:49:19
I guess just cash on hand. I just think.

[P12] 14:49:21
. I'm sorry for the. I'm sorry guys.

[Moderator] 14:49:27
Oh no, please. This is we've gotten all kinds of reactions. So this is really welcome feedback.

[P12] 14:49:33
Okay. Oh.

[Moderator] 14:49:33
So

[P12] 14:49:44
Okay, I don't know why there's this. I write it and I was like, I'm gonna press next, but, maybe it's needed information.

[Moderator] 14:49:53
Can you say a little bit more about the previous page like you mentioned you're wondering why why we have this page.

[P12] 14:50:02
Maybe I just don't like you can skip questions on this form. I guess I'm I imagine on the

[P12] 14:50:10
Like on the next page, there's gonna be more questions. So I don't, I guess, understand that because that's not what I got.

[P12] 14:50:19
The next page. And then I guess it's confusing. Once again, it says 7 7.

[P12] 14:50:28
It says it's time to review your requests. It says that I finished everything in my visual representation and now you're saying that based on responses I'm going to ask more.

[P12] 14:50:38
And after you submit your, you'll be edible for a waiver. I'm not gonna lie, I don't fully understand what's happening here.

[Moderator] 14:50:45
Okay, that's great feedback.

[P12] 14:50:47
So you'll be edible for a, or that means I got it. That means I won the golden ticket.

[P12] 14:50:54
But then. He's what you need to do on the next page. I just I feel like it should have been.

[P12] 14:51:00
Just this section right here. If this is what's supposed to happen, maybe it's because it's a prototype.

[P12] 14:51:06
It should be just this and then it would ask me the next few questions. This would not say. I guess it wouldn't say review your request.

[P12] 14:51:15
It just would. You know, I just would be like, okay, you have a couple more questions based on your answers.

[P12] 14:51:22
And then the next page would say, review your quest. Here, I don't know why it says that you don't need to do, but.

[Moderator] 14:51:26
Yeah.

[P12] 14:51:30
I don't know if I just, I don't know if I like it. Why?

[Moderator] 14:51:32
Yeah. It sounds like that this page might not be like really useful from your point of view. Or helpful.

[P12] 14:51:41
Yeah, I don't think it's helpful. And I don't like that.

[P12] 14:51:46
II don't like both parts. I think they need to be separated should be this part, then my further questions, and then it can be like next page, request, and then I'm gonna sign all these things.

[Moderator] 14:51:58
Hmm.

[P12] 14:51:58
Because I think that goes with the lump sum of, okay, I'm done and now these are the last few steps.

[P12] 14:52:05
Or something like that.

[Moderator] 14:52:06
Yeah, great, great feedback.

[P12] 14:52:10
Cause now I'm here and there's no, I don't. There's no more question, so I don't know if it's a prototype, but I do like.

[P12] 14:52:17
Once again, 7 9 7 that is reviewing my request. Oh, you know what? Okay, okay, okay.

[P12] 14:52:27
Yeah, this is what I thought was gonna be. I thought it went to a different page. But I like that, you know, you stay on this page, it just is extended.

[P12] 14:52:36
Once again, this is what I thought it would be in the front, you know, is it just the personal information contact information?

[P12] 14:52:43
So I like that you guys lump that together here. And I imagine this will, we collapse. Yep, I like that.

[P12] 14:52:53
Okay, I can't do those, but I imagine it's the same thing.

[P12] 14:52:59
Okay, and put my name.

[P12] 14:53:04
I like that. I like that. It's a crime. Yeah, let them know.

[P12] 14:53:10
And then. And I even like this too though actually right here. If I'm like, mmm, did I answer honestly?

[P12] 14:53:21
But I don't have time to go back and look. I like that I could just price that and save everything I had that confidence.

[P12] 14:53:27
Sometimes I'm not sure and I don't wanna you know. Run the risk of.

[P12] 14:53:33
Not so I don't know what to do. So I like that it's to me. I like that it's saving.

[Moderator] 14:53:38
Awesome.

[P12] 14:53:39
And then I guess. Yup, this is that page that we're all used to. You told me.

[P12] 14:53:51
I like this. I like the green mark. I'm in the green. I was, yeah, I like this.

[P12] 14:53:58
Okay.

[P12] 14:54:04
Question. I like it. I like the stage a lot.

[Moderator] 14:54:08
And what do you what do you like about it? What are?

[P12] 14:54:12
I just feel like job well done. Okay. It was approved. They'll send me something to my email.

[P12] 14:54:20
And then if I want, I can download the completed form or print it tells me what. The What is it?

[P12] 14:54:29
The overpayment bill was, accepted for. For these 2.

[P12] 14:54:35
I just feel like it's kind of like, and I like the green with the, the green little.

[P12] 14:54:40
Thing here with the check mark. I like all of that.

[Moderator] 14:54:43
Awesome, awesome. Thank you for your feedback. So now that you went through the whole form, what was your overall experience with the form like.

[P12] 14:54:53
You know, oh, it was good. There was just some confusion in the beginning like I said about What I was doing.

[P12] 14:55:03
I think because I just didn't have a full understanding and that could be just the the prototype and.

[P12] 14:55:10
Me just not understanding and we go through the process because I don't actually have one in my mind knows that.

[P12] 14:55:16
But I mean, I thought the process was fairly simple. And it was user friendly. I can go backwards forward and you guys would double back and just like what, you guys had that thing where you want to add something.

[Moderator] 14:55:22
Okay.

[P12] 14:55:31
I don't have to go back. I could just press another button and take me to the page I wanted to go to.

[P12] 14:55:35
I thought visually it was easy to read and go through minus some of the wordings when it when you guys would have.

[P12] 14:55:43
A couple of minutes ago when I when you guys said all you will have more questions and Sometimes awarding, I was like, what do you guys talking about?

[P12] 14:55:52
But overall I did like the experience if I had to do this I feel like. I wouldn't have to call someone.

[P12] 14:55:59
I wouldn't be stumped.

[P12] 14:56:01
I thought it was, you know, fairly easy. I actually enjoyed it.

[Moderator] 14:56:05
Okay, great. Thank you for your feedback. So in this last few minutes here, I have one last thing I want to show you.

[Moderator] 14:56:13
So if you scroll down and click on print this page, we've just linked to the intro page that you signed the beginning.

[Moderator] 14:56:20
Go ahead and click there. Oh, print. It should be clickable, but maybe.

[P12] 14:56:21
Oh, download or print?

[P12] 14:56:27
Hmm.

[Moderator] 14:56:31
Can you use your, keyboard arrow key to go to the next page. Let's see if that works.

[P12] 14:56:39
Oh, right here? Wait. What do you want?

[Moderator] 14:56:41
Oh, just on your on your keyboard. There are the arrow keys and there should be there we go.

[P12] 14:56:46
Oh.

[Moderator] 14:56:47
Awesome. Thank you. So this is taking us back to the intra page you signed the beginning.

[P12] 14:56:53
Yeah.

[Moderator] 14:56:53
And we have 2 versions that we're considering. This is the one you saw already. And if you click the arrow again, it'll take you to another version that we're considering.

[Moderator] 14:57:04
So. Yes, this is the second version. Take. Take a moment to look at it and let me.

[P12] 14:57:09
I go back to yours.

[Moderator] 14:57:11
You can, yes. And let me know, which version you think would be best for you and why.

[P12] 14:57:27
Sorry.

[Moderator] 14:57:27
And you can scroll down because, the differences are only on the lower half of the page.

[P12] 14:57:35
Oh, there's a couple. Oh, oh, okay, I'm going, I'm doing too much.

[P12] 14:57:38
Okay.

[Moderator] 14:57:39
So this is version one. That you already saw and then this is version 2.

[P12] 14:57:41
Okay.

[P12] 14:57:46
Okay, okay. Is very exciting for me. Hold on. Okay.

[P12] 14:57:55
I think I like this one better.

[Moderator] 14:57:56
Okay, and why is that?

[P12] 14:57:58
But it's hard because there's Okay, I wish I could see like on the same page together, but what I like about this one, I like the green.

[P12] 14:58:11
I don't know, there's something about like this part being bold in this part, even the, I think this is blue on the other page.

[P12] 14:58:19
But it just sticks out more to me. And then with this one it's

[P12] 14:58:27
The only thing with this.

[Moderator] 14:58:33
So this version doesn't give you the documents that you need, but it has less text. So it just has the headers.

[Moderator] 14:58:43
Without the.

[P12] 14:58:46
Give me 1 second. My phone's about to die. I thought I had enough juice. Hi, bad.

[Moderator] 14:58:47
The specifics.

[Moderator] 14:58:50
Oh no. No problem.

[P12] 14:58:57
Okay. I'm sorry guys. It's just so many.

[P12] 14:59:04
Like words on that other one. Where it's very, but I would appreciate. If there was, like a link kind of like what I talked about where you could kind of press it and then.

[P12] 14:59:16
A popup comes. Here it is. And I could, if someone is confused, of course you want them to have more information, but I also feel like.

[P12] 14:59:25
I don't think anyone's really confused about what you're asking. Because you're not really asking for documentation, but you're just explaining what these, entail.

[P12] 14:59:35
But I actually like, I like some of the way you had things bold on this one, but overall I think I said I like the other one better.

[P12] 14:59:43
It's all kind of like mixing some of them. I like like the bowl. Rain.

[P12] 14:59:50
Font. Okay, I'm seeing that again. I forgot you guys can see me.

[P12] 14:59:54
Like just how like this is bigger right here and even here. I just like the way it looked better.

[P12] 15:00:00
But this. I mean, like, who's really gonna read this? Bye like I can and also I'm not gonna read all this and then remember what you want me to do later.

[Moderator] 15:00:11
Right, right. That makes a lot of sense.

[P12] 15:00:14
I think that this works, but then if I could, you see how I could press this and then, that little box comes up.

[P12] 15:00:21
I think that would be better, but I like this setup better. But once again, mmm, I just like, see how this is blue?

[Moderator] 15:00:21
