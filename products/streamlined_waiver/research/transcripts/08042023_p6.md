[Moderator] 14:06:07
Now that we've started the recording, I have to ask you one more time. Are you okay with us recording this interview today?

[P6] 14:06:16
Yeah.

[Moderator] 14:06:16
Okay, great. Thank you. My next question is about your service in the military. Could you please tell me about the most important or memorable parts of your service?

[P6] 14:06:31
Let's see. Give me a second to try and think about it.

[P6] 14:06:41
I think it's well probably a lot of people go to this is the camaraderie, you know, us being with people that we care for almost 24 7 if we're down range or or sometimes when we're here at state side.

[P6] 14:06:54
I've really enjoyed those moments with them and, and you kind of.

[P6] 14:07:00
You don't really see that quite often out here in the civilian world, but you know that was a good part of my time in the service.

[Moderator] 14:07:08
Oh, that special sense of camaraderie. And friendship. What years did you serve?

[P6] 14:07:14
I served from 2010 to 2016.

[Moderator] 14:07:18
And do you still see, some of the friends you made during that time?

[P6] 14:07:24
Oh yeah, yeah, but again with the military, everyone's scattered all over the world basically, so it doesn't.

[P6] 14:07:32
We don't see them quite often. As I would like.

[Moderator] 14:07:34
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Thank you for sharing your experiences. In this next part of the interview, I will be sharing the prototype or the demo that we're working on.

[Moderator] 14:07:48
So it's a form to help with VA copay debt. And I'd also like to ask, about your experiences with VA copay yet.

[Moderator] 14:07:59
What has been your most recent experience with VA copay?

[P6] 14:08:03
Let's see. It was about. Recent that I could remember was a few years ago.

[P6] 14:08:11
I got a procedure through the VA. That we went. It wasn't done at a VA hospital or anything like that.

[P6] 14:08:19
We used Some other hospital, something outside of the network. And that worked out quite well. And then I got the co pay bill and I know this there was a very small fraction of what it would normally cost.

[P6] 14:08:32
So I immediately paid that off. Right then and there so it wouldn't haunt me. For hours or weeks.

[Moderator] 14:08:40
Yeah. That's great. It sounds like it was. Smaller amount than what you're expecting and you were able to pay it off quickly.

[P6] 14:08:47
Yeah.

[Moderator] 14:08:50
Thank you for sharing your experience. So in this next part of the interview, we're going to share the digital experience that we're working on and ask for your feedback.

[Moderator] 14:09:02
A few things I want you to know, you'll be interacting with a prototype that will not work exactly the way you expect.

[Moderator] 14:09:09
Some of the areas of the prototype will be clickable and some will not. Also, some of the areas of the prototype will be pre-filled with fake information.

[Moderator] 14:09:20
So if it seems a little bit confusing at first, that's, that's why, because we've pre-filled some fake information.

[Moderator] 14:09:28
And since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

[Moderator] 14:09:34
In this task, we just ask that you please share your honest feedback about the quality of your experience filling out this form.

[Moderator] 14:09:42
If you were to fill it out, please comment on anything that is clear and unclear. And please remember to think out loud.

[Moderator] 14:09:51
And so it seems like you're joining from mobile today, so I will share mobile link.

[Moderator] 14:10:08
So I just, that in the chat and if you could please open the link. And then navigate back to zoom once you've opened it and share your screen and I can, help with that as needed.

[P6] 14:10:21
Okay, let's see. Not to open this project of yours.

[P6] 14:10:33
Okay, so I open or I press the begin sort of button. So do you want me to go back?

[Moderator] 14:10:41
So yes, please. Go back to the zoom screen. If you're great and then there should be some buttons on the bottom of your screen where one is in green and it says share screen.

[P6] 14:10:44
Okay. Yeah.

[P6] 14:10:56
Okay.

[Moderator] 14:10:56
And when you open that, there will be options to share. Desktop or Google Chrome or Safari, depending on which browser

[Moderator] 14:11:06
And you should see the link that you just opened.

[P6] 14:11:09
Okay, give me 1 s. Okay. Sure.

[Moderator] 14:11:11
Sure.

[P6] 14:11:24
So there was there's one that says web URL. Would you want me to press that one as a share?

[P6] 14:11:30
Or no. Let's. Okay.

[Moderator] 14:11:30
I believe so, yes.

[P6] 14:11:37
Give me 1 s. I'm gonna copy.

[P6] 14:11:40
That link you gave me.

[Moderator] 14:11:42
Oh, yes. Sorry. I guess that's the other way to do it. But,

[P6] 14:11:48
And see right there.

[Moderator] 14:11:55
Great. I see that it's opening. And whenever you're ready, please click proceed.

[Moderator] 14:12:05
I'm not seeing it on there. Oh, okay, great.

[Moderator] 14:12:12
Great. So we're going to ask you to go through this form and fill it out as you would normally.

[Moderator] 14:12:17
You can use fake information if you'd like. And so I imagine that you navigate to this page because you want help with your V.

[Moderator] 14:12:26
And I'm going to be observing silently for the most part and I'll ask you questions at certain times.

[Moderator] 14:12:33
And please remember to think out loud as you're going through this. Hey.

[P6] 14:12:36
Alright, got it. So let's see.

[P6] 14:12:48
Okay, let's see. Request help with VA form 5 6 5 5. And

[P6] 14:13:10
Now would you want me to? Just like hypotheticalically press some of these buttons. Yeah. Oh.

[Moderator] 14:13:18
So normally you would be able to, but because of the limitations of the prototype, we pre selected these.

[P6] 14:13:23
Oh, okay. Yeah, that got it.

[Moderator] 14:13:24
Is field. But normally you would be able to explore this page and make different selections.

[P6] 14:14:09
Oh, work history for the past 2 years. Okay. Monthly income. Assets.

[P6] 14:14:29
So we may also ask you to share this information for you. Or and your spouse.

[Moderator] 14:14:36
Let's say and your spouse.

[P6] 14:14:36
Okay.

[P6] 14:14:40
It says May. Okay, so then that means y'all would ask us. Possibly about these questions.

[P6] 14:14:47
For me and my wife. Okay.

[Moderator] 14:14:52
What's up to you on this page? If anything.

[P6] 14:14:57
Let's see. I was in the, mmm.

[P6] 14:15:07
I've never seen this sort of request. From the VA before, you know, asking for.

[P6] 14:15:13
The work history, the assets part too. So it's just some new information that they need. To help I'm assuming to help pay for the copay.

[P6] 14:15:25
So they would look through our. Work history and see if it's okay or kinda sketchy.

[P6] 14:15:31
And I'm assuming that they would. Probably try and work out the plan. So it wouldn't hurt.

[P6] 14:15:39
My bank account or my assets. As much as another person. Which is nice. I can see where some people would probably feel uncomfortable.

[P6] 14:15:50
One into. Give this sort of stuff to the VA, but I mean, it's not.

[P6] 14:15:57
You know, the government probably has a bunch on on me anyway.

[Moderator] 14:16:02
And why would some people feel uncomfortable?

[P6] 14:16:05
Oh, when anything concerning finance. People are very hesitant to either talk about it or release it.

[P6] 14:16:19
Yeah, cause some of these they would have probably never have mentioned it. To anyone besides. Very close people.

[P6] 14:16:28
Like if you've ever declared bankruptcy. You know?

[P6] 14:16:53
And it says it should take about 60 min. So.

[P6] 14:16:59
Is someone on the other side of this? Gonna go through the paperwork or is it done electronically?

[Moderator] 14:17:09
That's a great question. Yeah.

[P6] 14:17:20
We'll send you this information by mail. I know some veterans. Have uneasy or like, uncertain living accommodations.

[P6] 14:17:36
So maybe that main part would be. And difficult for them. And I know we're getting more into the digit age and I don't know if there's.

[Moderator] 14:17:37
Right.

[P6] 14:17:46
Some rules or laws about sending it. Also by email.

[Moderator] 14:17:52
Hmm, that's a great point. Yeah. Yeah, some people might not have a permanent address or.

[Moderator] 14:17:58
I'm a mailing address.

[P6] 14:18:10
And then I continue to start. Your request now button?

[Moderator] 14:18:15
Yes, please.

[P6] 14:18:17
Got it.

[Moderator] 14:18:20
So in the next few sections, I'll just mostly be observing and if I have any questions, I'll be asking you, but, just pull this out as you would normally commenting on anything that's clear, unclear.

[P6] 14:18:32
Okay, got it.

[P6] 14:18:38
This is pretty straightforward.

[P6] 14:18:41
Nothing special about that page.

[P6] 14:18:46
Okay.

[P6] 14:18:51
Okay, it's nice that they give you the option of choosing which debts to. Work on.

[Moderator] 14:19:00
Have you seen this before? When you log in to my VA?

[P6] 14:19:06
Did this portion of trying to pay?

[Moderator] 14:19:09
Have you ever been able to look at, any debts you've had? On.

[P6] 14:19:17
I don't think I've always done it either through a phone. Or in person or mail, I don't think I've done it online.

[P6] 14:19:26
If I have, I don't really remember it.

[Moderator] 14:19:28
Okay.

[P6] 14:19:36
Okay. Hey, a request. Help by November first. Is there a specific reason why?

[P6] 14:19:45
Why it would be November first?

[Moderator] 14:19:50
Yeah, that's a great question. For the purpose of the prototype we put just a date that kind of just a regular date.

[P6] 14:19:55
Okay, just a regular date. Okay, okay. I just didn't.

[Moderator] 14:19:59
That is a really good question.

[P6] 14:20:00
Okay, so then that And okay.

[P6] 14:20:09
Oops, I bet. Okay. So I'll do the more expensive one.

[P6] 14:20:19
Okay. And simple. So I'm just gonna say yes.

[P6] 14:20:29
And then output. Jane. No.

[P6] 14:20:36
And it's good that you guys put obviously required because sometimes Some of us just roll through this and don't want to put anything or just assume it's optional.

[P6] 14:20:46
So that is quite helpful.

[P6] 14:20:49
How many dependence do you will say what?

[P6] 14:20:58
Okay.

[P6] 14:21:03
So since I put one, I'm just gonna do the first line. Only one dependent.

[P6] 14:21:13
Okay, and then work history. So I'm gonna say yes.

[P6] 14:21:24
And I'll say full time. Employers name. And we'll just say US.

[P6] 14:21:33
Government. Sure.

[P6] 14:21:38
And I will say no for this one.

[P6] 14:21:48
Let's say April. Of 2019. Now. 2 years.

[P6] 14:21:57
2021.

[P6] 14:22:01
And stop working and October. 2021.

[P6] 14:22:18
Okay.

[P6] 14:22:30
So I'm assuming you guys just put in the information already about the gross. Monthly income and federal tax and stuff like that, right?

[Moderator] 14:22:37
Right, it looks like that's been pre-filled.

[P6] 14:22:40
Okay, got it. So I'll just choose that. That job for the last for the past 2 years.

[P6] 14:22:48
And I'll continue.

[P6] 14:22:53
Benefits of via disability and education benefits. So I Did school too. Okay.

[P6] 14:23:02
That's quite nice. I do that is quite nice because sometimes I have to go through hoops.

[P6] 14:23:09
To see. How much money I was paid. The, you know, when I did the GI Bill or how much I got paid for a disability.

[P6] 14:23:20
So that is quite nice.

[Moderator] 14:23:20
So it's nice to be able to see your, benefits, reflected in this way. Have, have you seen that before or not?

[P6] 14:23:24
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

[P6] 14:23:28
No, no, I have to go through multiple steps to go into to try and see. Payment history and stuff like that.

[Moderator] 14:23:38
Hmm.

[P6] 14:23:38
So that was quite.

[P6] 14:23:45
Finance investments.

[P6] 14:23:55
Oh, So we'll just put in to. 200. And then, 500.

[P6] 14:24:10
Okay.

[Moderator] 14:24:12
And how are you feeling at this point in the form?

[P6] 14:24:15
This part right here.

[Moderator] 14:24:17
Oh, just in general. What you've seen so far, how are you feeling so far about the form?

[P6] 14:24:24
I mean, I feel all right. I'm I bet some Some veterans would think that. Or just most people in general.

[P6] 14:24:33
They'll see that step 2 of 7 and they would automatically think in their head. That, okay, I did one step paid like step one.

[P6] 14:24:41
Just that one page counted as step one and then the next page should count as step 2, step 3, step 4, but I understand why you guys are doing this.

[P6] 14:24:49
That is just way more stretched out. You wouldn't want to put step. 50 out of a hundred the veterans would feel a little bit.

[Moderator] 14:24:57
Right.

[P6] 14:25:00
Over the questions are fine. Pretty short, pretty easy to understand. There's not much.

[Moderator] 14:25:01
Yeah, yeah.

[Moderator] 14:25:08
Okay, great.

[P6] 14:25:10
Requiring of me from each, from each page so far. So say sure.

[P6] 14:25:22
Say.

[P6] 14:25:26
And my god.

[P6] 14:25:33
Do you currently work at this job? Okay, so. I guess I'm

[Moderator] 14:25:38
That is a typo. I'm sorry about that. It should say, does your spouse currently work at this job?

[P6] 14:25:40
Okay. Okay.

[P6] 14:25:45
Okay, got it. So, yes.

[Moderator] 14:25:45
Good, good catch.

[P6] 14:25:51
She worked May of 2020.

[P6] 14:26:00
And then that type of, but yeah, I'm sure you guys will. Check on that.

[P6] 14:26:09
What's your spouse group? Monthly income at this job. So we'll say.

[P6] 14:26:18
1,500.

[P6] 14:26:24
. And on what says your spouse pay. Federal No, Florida doesn't have to state tax.

[P6] 14:26:42
Okay.

[P6] 14:26:45
And there.

[P6] 14:26:55
Okay, how much do you pay? You say a hundred 50. We'll say a hundred.

[P6] 14:27:05
Let's say. A 100

[P6] 14:27:18
Does your spouse give the events? We'll say.

[P6] 14:27:23
Yes.

[P6] 14:27:29
Oh wait, if I went back, is that a mistake too where the blue bars show that it's almost done?

[Moderator] 14:27:33
Hey. I believe so. Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

[P6] 14:27:39
No, you're good. You're good. Very good. Okay.

[P6] 14:27:45
How should your spouse get each month?

[P6] 14:27:47
We'll see. 200.

[P6] 14:27:55
Say 0 for education.

[P6] 14:28:06
Alimony.

[Moderator] 14:28:20
Here it would normally reflect what you've selected.

[P6] 14:28:22
Okay, okay, got it, got it, cause I was trying to remember. So we'll put.

[P6] 14:28:29
For the 100 and we will put 200

[P6] 14:28:34
Okay. Easy.

[P6] 14:28:39
Now cash on hands. Not in my bank. So that's asking. What's in my pocket right now?

[P6] 14:28:47
What's on me?

[P6] 14:28:51
We'll just say I got. $50.

[P6] 14:28:57
Which is pretty easy. I mean, most people would know. How much money they have currently on them.

[Moderator] 14:29:04
What about you? Do you happen to usually know what cash on hand do you have?

[P6] 14:29:10
Oh yeah, I mean all the time. Especially if it's my wallet. I almost always.

[P6] 14:29:16
I'm aware of for one where my wallet is. And 2, how much cash I have just in case I stumble upon.

[P6] 14:29:24
Someplace someone that purchase something.

[Moderator] 14:29:26
And could you clarify what cash on hand means to you?

[P6] 14:29:30
Catch on it. Well, cash on me. That's what I see it as I see it as cash currently on me.

[P6] 14:29:39
Right now. It could be I mean I know you guys are probably think there. Let's say this scenario, I have 20 bucks on me, but I got 200.

[P6] 14:29:51
Stashed away. Under my mattress in my house. Well, then that would.

[P6] 14:30:00
Hmm. I would think about that too. Actually, if I thought about cash on hand. I would think of that as well.

[P6] 14:30:12
But some people see that as. No, I'm over complicating it. Cash on.

[Moderator] 14:30:17
Is there a? Sorry, you're absolutely right, cash on hand is cash you have and in your pocket or at your house.

[Moderator] 14:30:26
Is there another word you can think of for cash on hand or is cash on hand? How you would say it?

[P6] 14:30:33
In something very short like that in 3 words.

[Moderator] 14:30:38
Yeah, like any, similar word for that that you know, or that there's no right or wrong answer.

[Moderator] 14:30:47
We're just, curious to know if they're any other terms you've heard that.

[Moderator] 14:30:52
That are similar and if not that's fine too.

[P6] 14:30:55
Yeah, no, I think that would be the The easiest I thought maybe like cash.

[P6] 14:31:03
Freely available but then that might be I guess into the gray area some more. Whereas cash on hand.

[Moderator] 14:31:09
Right.

[P6] 14:31:12
Isn't as gray.

[Moderator] 14:31:14
Okay.

[P6] 14:31:16
So I do think that. The best choice of words for this.

[Moderator] 14:31:24
Great. Thanks for your feedback.

[P6] 14:31:27
Okay. You'll be eligible for a waiver. Okay, and the waiver is obviously if I qualify for you know, a reduced payment.

[P6] 14:31:40
For the debt, they would let me know.

[P6] 14:31:45
Your application.

[P6] 14:31:49
Okay, and then I get to review which I've seen this part quite a bit on the VA website.

[P6] 14:31:56
So this is nothing new.

[Moderator] 14:31:57
On other forms.

[P6] 14:31:58
Oh yeah, yeah the whole. The review part? Yeah.

[Moderator] 14:32:04
Is there a firm that comes to mind that where you've seen this?

[P6] 14:32:13
Let's see. I think when I was doing my GI Bill benefits on there. Trying to get I think a certification of.

[P6] 14:32:21
Enrollment or something like that. I believe I recall seeing that veteran information part. Or like the review.

[P6] 14:32:28
Portion before I actually press. Except just in case I mess up.

[Moderator] 14:32:33
Awesome.

[P6] 14:32:39
And the

[P6] 14:32:47
It must been a while, but I don't really remember seeing a statement of truth. Before.

[Moderator] 14:32:53
How do you feel about there being a statement of truth?

[P6] 14:32:59
Well, it puts me like

[P6] 14:33:02
It puts more, I would say pressure or more. That I should be. Very confident of what I'm actually submitting, especially with some concerning finance.

[P6] 14:33:13
Of a debt that I need to pay off. Then this just solidifies that, okay, you. Mister or whatever my name, H Hector.

[P6] 14:33:24
Smith that you are confirming. What you've put on there is right. This is basically a signature digit, And, yeah, I mean.

[P6] 14:33:37
That's basically it. That's what I would see. So I think. I'll just go with what I said.

[Moderator] 14:33:40
Okay.

[P6] 14:33:44
After Smith.

[P6] 14:33:49
Most people never read that. Right, so we just say yes.

[P6] 14:33:58
Okay, you're eligible for a waiver good. People always like to see that immediate sort of. Response when doing this stuff.

[P6] 14:34:08
Everyone hates to wait.

[P6] 14:34:19
Oh, good to see what else like when whenever it's like this sort of stuff. I would like to make sure all my ducks are in a row.

[P6] 14:34:29
So if I, if I do this and it said you don't need to do anything else at this time.

[P6] 14:34:33
That makes me feel better. Because if not, I would probably calling. To make sure, hey, am I good here?

[P6] 14:34:42
I just turned this form in. Am I all right? So that's

[Moderator] 14:34:44
Yeah. That makes sense.

[P6] 14:34:52
Print the form.

[P6] 14:35:04
Alright, and then is there anything else you want me to do on here?

[Moderator] 14:35:09
Any other thoughts about this page or anything that's clear or unclear?

[P6] 14:35:16
I'm assuming print this page or download. Completed form is just for my benefit. Like.

[P6] 14:35:22
I filled this out and I can keep this. For you know future information that's what I'm assuming.

[P6] 14:35:31
So that is okay.

[Moderator] 14:35:32
That's right.

[P6] 14:35:36
That's good about how the check. The status, I'm pretty sure I've seen that on the website before for other things.

[P6] 14:35:44
Yeah, I mean, that's basically it. That's all I can. Think of for this page.

[Moderator] 14:35:48
Great. Yeah, thanks for feedback. Now that you've gone through this form, what was your overall experience like?

[P6] 14:35:57
Oh, I think it was fine. I think it's. It's pretty easy. There's it's not too complicated.

[P6] 14:36:03
Pretty simple sort of request. That a person should somewhat know of.

[Moderator] 14:36:11
Great. And so in this last part of the interview, I wanted to show you another, version of the introduction page that we, showed you in the beginning.

[Moderator] 14:36:24
So I think if you tap on this page it'll take you to the original intro page.

[P6] 14:36:33
Tap on the page that I'm on right now.

[Moderator] 14:36:36
Or actually if you tap on print this document Princess page.

[P6] 14:36:40
Okay, got it.

[Moderator] 14:36:46
So this is the intro page that you saw earlier and that you read. And we have a second version that we'd like to show you.

[Moderator] 14:36:55
If you Tap on the page once again and I'll show you the second.

[P6] 14:37:02
Okay.

[Moderator] 14:37:03
And take a moment to review this second version.

[Moderator] 14:37:14
And let me know which version you think would be best for you if you were going through this experience.

[P6] 14:37:40
I'm trying to see what the difference is from the first one to the second one.

[Moderator] 14:37:47
I think you can also go back if you want to see the previous version.

[P6] 14:37:52
Oh, okay. I think II see the. Option.

[P6] 14:38:07
Okay, okay. Alright, so. This is the first one.

[Moderator] 14:38:12
Correct.

[P6] 14:38:15
I like this one more because you guys have Expanded on what?

[P6] 14:38:24
I need to actually. Share with y'all. Like the second one it was just plain sort of stuff like what do you mean monthly income what do you mean by assets like assets or Could mean a whole bunch of stuff, but if someone's not as financially savvy.

[P6] 14:38:44
They might be like, what's assets mean again? What does that really mean?

[Moderator] 14:38:50
Great, great point.

[P6] 14:38:52
Let me see.

[P6] 14:39:02
I'm gonna get back to. The first Yeah, this. The one that explains what you need.

[P6] 14:39:22
Me way better. Way better.

[Moderator] 14:39:24
Okay.

[P6] 14:39:28
I don't think I saw this in in the second bitch that she said is why we asked for this information.

[P6] 14:39:34
That's 2 to inform me because you know some people are very apprehensive about the government even though you know they served and stuff like that.

[P6] 14:39:47
Why do you want this stuff from me? And you have explained it. In this little blue box. So it would make me feel better.

[Moderator] 14:39:56
Yeah, that makes sense. Which, which version would you be most likely to read? I know you did read the first time around, but.

[P6] 14:39:57
About

[P6] 14:40:07
So this one is real strong. This one's probably it. Let me go back to the other one.

[P6] 14:40:23
Yeah, it would have to be the one. That gives me more and more details. Cause again, this thing with finance, I wanna know.

[Moderator] 14:40:29
Okay.

[P6] 14:40:33
Exactly what you need for me so I don't mess up. And it could jeopardize My chance for a waiver.

[P6] 14:40:41
If I don't clearly know what you need from me.

[Moderator] 14:40:45
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

[Moderator] 14:40:49
Great. Any other thoughts before we finish up?

[P6] 14:40:55
No, not from this page or the last one. This one is. My preferred page. Yeah.

[Moderator] 14:41:02
And what about the just so the overall experience or like the outcome of the filling up the form?

[P6] 14:41:09
I think if. I was just Joe Schmo. Doing this sort of stuff for a waiver to help pay off my debt.

[P6] 14:41:20
It doesn't, it's not too complicated. It sounds like it, it shouldn't take that much time.

[P6] 14:41:26
Honestly, you shouldn't.

[P6] 14:41:31
If this is a person who has stable housing. Then they should be able to. Answer these questions within a a timely amount of time, you know, kind of.

[Moderator] 14:41:47
Right. Right. Hey, any questions for us before before we finish up?

[Moderator] 14:42:03
I also want to share the link, to the DET portal where you can see any active debts you have.

[Moderator] 14:42:10
And your benefits. So I will

[P6] 14:42:10
Okay
