This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 


**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes 

- - - 

## Initial Findings

_Add ~5-10 top of mind findings. Include quotes if they are available or particularly noteworthy. [Example top line summary.](https://portigal.com/reading-ahead-topline-summary/)_


**This Streamlined Waiver had a more positive reception than the Full FSR**

- This is in comparision to our [last study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_fsr/research/enhanced_fsr/research-findings.md) which tested the full FSR path. The streamlined waiver tested in this current study was described as "easy" and "straightforward".

> "It was easy to navigate...it didn't ask a lot of questions and it was quick." -P5
> 
>“[Moderator] Based on your previous experience with this form, how do you feel about seeing that you're able to skip questions on this form? - Well, it makes it easier. I mean, I'm not an old, I mean, I'm old, but I'm not an old like a lot of veterans that I see at the hospital. Something like this would make it much easier for those folks Along with myself.” -P9


**Split reception on the condensed intro page versus the full intro page copy**

- In comparing a lean version with the full version of the intro, preference was equally split. The majority of participants skipped ahead on the intro page and we recommend removing the alert box that hides the intro page content and keeping both action links to minimize frustration or drop off.

> "Other people they may like prefer this version, like they may not like all the extra stuff. But I would prefer the the extra information." -P8
> 
> "I would read the second page (lean intro). But - It doesn't have enough information about what you're seeking. In your work history. Like the employer's name. Starting end date monthly. Like some people might need help to grab their W2 Or their paystub. You know what I mean?" -P1

>“[Moderator] And between these 2 versions, which version do you think is the best for you?The first one [long intro], cause this one, The second one, it doesn't give you a lot of information. I think the first one gives you examples, I guess, is the word. Because some people might not understand monthly living expenses.” -P9
>

**Overall Comprehension**

- The majority of participants understood the purpose of the form, with the exception of 2 participants: one who said she had suffered a stroke that affected her memory, and the other who did not understand the form in the beginning.

> "I think it's very easy to use, like way easy to navigate, and I don't have any issues filling out the form. But I like that the definition of each term, like what you need to fill out." -P8


**Confirmation page and trust**

- For some participants, at first, there was positive reception when seeing the green checkmark and "You're eligible for a waiver". Then disappointment when reading the fine print. This is an active conversation between VA stakeholders and SMEs and the copy is not final yet. Based on what we tested, it's clear that an automatic decision is unfamiliar and surprising, and also would be very positive. While at the same time, some participants can't believe it since they haven't seen it done before. An email and a letter to confirm and prove this would be helpful. One participant expected automatic approval as she compared it to submitted a form for Travel Pay. As we saw in our last study, the term "waiver" was not understood by all participants.

> "So they will automatically know you're eligible for a waiver. [P1]
[Moderator] How do you feel about that? [P1] Well, it seems like they would have to review it.
The idea is just a shock, I suppose...like in the more positive sense...I feel like the Veterans Administration, I guess, is becoming a little more sensitive to what the Veterans need now. It's taken a little while, but I mean at least it's coming." -P1


**Transition page**

- Since the transition page was confusing for some participants, we recommend removing the "next steps" portion as part of the same alert as "skipping ahead" to minimize confusion, and separate different ideas.

> "It sounds like it's telling me that based on my responses that I'm gonna be eligible for a waiver to get the bills taken care of. It's telling me right now that I am eligible for a waiver. So now I'm happy. So now I'm gonna submit. I'll continue." -P4

**The cash on hand question was easily understood by all participants**

- Participants easily understood the "Cash on hand" question and thought it was worded well. 

> "Now cash on hand. Not in my bank. So that's asking, "What's in my pocket right now? What's on me?". Well just say I got $50. Which is pretty easy. I mean, most people would know how much money they have currently on them." -P6
> 
> "What does cash on hand mean to you?" "The amount of cash I have in my wallet. To me, cash on hand means it's what you have that you can get your hands on." -P1
