## Start Here

## Prep/Getting to know you (10 minutes)

Welcome! Thank you so much for your time today.  
How are you today?

My name is Charlotte and I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. [purpose]

This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services. [meaning]

My goal today is to learn how easy or difficult it is for you to use a digital experience we have created in order for us to improve it. [topic]

You’ll notice there are a few people on the call already. They’re my colleagues and they’re here to listen and to learn. Is that ok with you? [permission] [Turn on cameras and greet participant]

Your comfort and wellbeing are very important to us. Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. You will be compensated for your time regardless.

If you don't feel comfortable answering any questions, please let me know and we can move on. [comfort and consent]

Finally, your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]

Do you have any questions for me? [opportunity to ask questions]

Just want to ensure the next 60 minutes are still good for you today? [time expectations]

I’d love to ask a question to get to know you before we start the interview about your experiences with debt.

[Rapport building]

We like to start off with a lighthearted question to get to know you better.

What’s something that has inspired you recently?

(If silent) For example, a quote, a movie or show, a person)

(refine questions for this population and trauma informed for homelessness)

Thank you for sharing! Those are great interests to have (personalize response).

Do I have your permission to video record our interview? (recordings are stored securely and deleted after we complete analysis)  [permission]

## [Service Experience/Context Building]

My next question is about your service in the military.

Can you tell me about the most important or memorable or meaningful parts of your service?

Thank you for sharing your experiences.

## [VA debt experience baseline]

Today I will be taking you through a form to help with VA debt. First, I’d like to briefly hear about your experiences with VA debt.

  

-   What has been your most recent experience with VA copay debt? [establish baseline]
    

## [Prototype]

Let’s go to the next part of the interview where we are going to share a digital experience we’ve created and ask for your feedback. A few things I want you to know:

  

-   You'll be interacting with a prototype that may not work exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
    
-   In this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback about the quality of your experience filling out this form if you were to fill it out. Please comment on what is clear and unclear.
    

  
  
  

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page.

[Sharing screen instructions as needed]

  

We are going to go through a form and ask you to fill it out, as you would normally. Imagine you navigated to this page because you want help with your VA copay debt.

  

I am going to observe silently, and I will ask you questions at certain times. Also, I will ask you to pause at certain sections and I will ask you follow up questions.

  

You can use fake information for the form if you prefer.

Now that we’ve gone through the full experience, I want to revisit the introduction page you saw in the beginning.

[I will screen share]

Here is the original we shared with you [show original]

Here is a different version we are thinking of [show revised]

Based on what you see here, and if you can imagine you were starting over the experience and it was the first time you were filling out the form, can you please tell me:

-   What version would you be most likely to read? Why?
    
-   What version feels easier to understand?
    

Going back to the different version,

-   How do you feel about the amount of information given here to help you understand what is needed from you to fill out the form?
    

Our goals are to make sure that someone would read this section and also that it has enough information.

-   How do you feel about these 2 versions and which one do you think is best for you?
    

  
  

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

  
  

-   Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?  
      
    

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works well for all Veterans.
