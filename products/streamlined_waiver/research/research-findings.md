## Research Goals
### [](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/sharing-research/research-findings-template.md#background)Background

The Streamlined Waiver allows Veterans who meet the qualifications to bypass sections of the Financial Status Report and automatically receive a waiver of their copays. [This Mural](https://app.mural.co/invitation/mural/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1678973946956?sender=ua78f969c4cddcbfe56b27885&key=340ed11b-aab8-42d3-b488-f9abf67b3513) with the different user flows will be the best way to understand all of the paths that users can take. We need to let users know that they may not have to fill out the full form and why they may have bypassed some questions if they meet the qualifications.

Simplifying the process for claiming medical debt forgiveness, VA will streamline the request process and set a simple income threshold for receiving medical debt relief. The request process will include an online option for veterans and reduce the effort required by veterans to access relief. These changes will go into effect this month.

The assumption is that transparency is important, the framing as well as the expectation setting for the streamlined waiver process will be key and contribute to a seamless and satisfying experience for Veterans seeking to resolve their debt. At the same time, our stakeholders have expressed concern that an upfront transparency reveal of the possibility of an automatic waiver could be confusing and upsetting for Veterans if they are deemed not to be eligible. **We also know that, currently, 95% of users with VHA debt (copay debt) will be approved for the automatic waiver.**

  

Continuing the [usability study we did in May 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/combined_fsr/research/enhanced_fsr), the Streamlined Waiver usability study is an extension of this work. The Streamlined Waiver offers a revised intro page, offering limited copy in terms of transparency and offering clarity on the required sections the Veteran will be expected to fill out. Furthermore, the Streamlined Waiver will take the Veteran through a dynamic flow unique to their financial and life situation (income limits thresholds, number of dependents, spouse's information, cash on hand). Taking into account the length of the form and the fact that users skim content, we seek to make the form's content scannable and easily digestible.

Which  [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md)  does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

This research supports these main [OCTO objectives and goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme):

-   Veterans can manage their health services online
-   Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
-   Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
    

This research supports increasing these measures:

-   Usage of digital, self-service tools
-   Percent of applications submitted online (vs. paper)
-   Completion rate of online transactions
-   Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov
-   Number of VA.gov users as a function of total Veteran population
-   Benefit value (in $) delivered from online applications or transactions

This research supports decreasing these measures:

-   Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution
-   Time to successful complete and submit online transactions
-  Time to process online applications (vs. paper)

Where does your product fit into the  [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)? Are there moments that matter?

  
Other key moments this research touches in the Veteran journey are:

-   Attending to health needs
-   Taking care of myself
-   Managing my declining health


### [](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/sharing-research/research-findings-template.md#research-goals)Research Goals
**Usability study (40 minutes)**

**Test [User Flow for Dan](https://app.mural.co/invitation/mural/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1678973946956?sender=ua78f969c4cddcbfe56b27885&key=340ed11b-aab8-42d3-b488-f9abf67b3513)** (automatic approval flow under GMT)

**Areas being considered:**

-   **New copy (intro page, transition page, confirmation/decision page)**
    
-   **Transition page and progress bar**
    
-   **Review page**
    
-   **Submission confirmation page and waiver decision language** 
    

***Goal 1: Evaluate the usability of the Streamlined Waiver experience***
Minimize confusion with a “skipped question” transition page

***Goal 2: Evaluate the comprehension of the Streamlined Waiver experience and the new copy additions to the FSR/Streamlined Waiver pages.***

Clarity, and define expectations early to minimize cognitive burden

***Goal 3: Evaluate Veterans trust, and subjective experience of FSR/Streamlined Waiver. Has it changed?***

**Concept test (10 minutes)**

In the last 10 minutes of the usability study interviews, we will do a small concept evaluation in which we seek to understand whether Veterans prefer a lean intro page in terms of copy, or a more extensive intro page. We will prevent both side by side. Where can we backfill content, or cut out redundant content?




## Research Questions


1. What do Veterans understand about the FSR form at the intro, as they progress through the form, and at the end of the form?
    
2.  Is it clear from the revised intro page what information they need to provide?
    
3. What is their level of trust through this process and experience? Is it any different from the FSR and eFSR?
    
4.  How do Veterans with medical copay debt understand “Help with your debt” without upfront reveal of the possible outcomes repeated throughout the form (waiver, automatic waiver, or payment plan)
    
* Is the mention of “Help with your debt” only enough to motivate the Veteran to fill out the form? How do Veterans perceive this Help could look like? Does it matter to them?
    
* There is a trade-off, in terms of providing just enough information, so as not to overwhelm Veterans filling out the form, while also being comprehensive.
 
5. What is their level of confidence in the process?
    
6. How do they understand the “Cash in hand” question? What do they understand “Cash in hand” to mean? How clear or unclear is this question?
    
7. How do they feel about the transition between the last section (cash on hand question) and the transition page? How clear is this transition?
    
8. How do they feel about the review page?
    
9. How do they feel about the confirmation page? Is there anything else they would wish to see on this page?

**Concept Evaluation**
- Between the brief intro page and the extensive intro page, which we will show them side by side, which one do they feel is most helpful? Why? 

## Methodology 


-   Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research
-   Usability testing - appropriate for evaluative research
-   The sessions will be remote moderated interviews on Zoom.


## Hypotheses and Conclusions


**We hypothesize that:**

- **The revised intro page will be clear**
  
    **_Likely True_**

    Although many participants initially skipped the intro page, once they read it they generally understood it.
    
-   **The form flow will be clear and easy to understand**

    **_Likely True_**

    This form flow was well received and described as "straightforward" and "easy to use".
    
    
-   **The transition page will make sense**
     
     **_Likely False_**

    Some participants did not realize they were skipping steps after reading this page. Some focused on the "next steps" portion of the page as opposed to the portion of the page that let them know they were on the expedited path and were skipping steps. Despite not knowing they were skipping steps, those participants had no issues continuing with the form and did not experience any confusion with completing and submitting the form.
    
-   **The submission page notification with the reveal of an automatic approval will be well received and maybe even positively surprising.**

    **_Likely True_**

       The confirmation page was originally meant to communicate to the Veteran that their selected copay debt was automatically approved. The language was updated right before the study began to "You're eligible for a waiver" by stakeholders. While this was mostly well received by participants, there was some confusion as some felt the messaging was ambiguous. Immediately after this study, the language was changed to "You're tentatively eligible for debt relief". 


## Key Findings

1. **This Streamlined Waiver had a more positive reception than the Full FSR and was described as "easy" and "straightforward".**

2. **Overall Comprehension: Most understood the purpose of the form.**


3. **Split reception on the condensed intro page versus the full intro page copy. In comparing a lean version with the full version of the intro, preference was equally split.**

4. **The cash on hand question was easily understood by all participants.**

5. **Transition page clarity: Most did not understand the purpose of this page, we recommend removing the content related to "next steps."**

6. **Confirmation page and trust: Immediate waiver decision was welcome and surprising. Some commented that the language was ambiguous.**



## Details of Findings 


Labels: Streamlined waiver, financial status report form (FSR)

### 1. **Streamlined Waiver had a more positive reception than the Full FSR**
   This is in comparison to our [last study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_fsr/research/enhanced_fsr/research-findings.md) which tested the full FSR path. The streamlined waiver tested in this current study was described as "easy" and "straightforward".
   
> _"It was easy to navigate...it didn't ask a lot of questions and it was quick." -P5_

> _Moderator: "Based on your previous experience with this form, how do you feel about seeing that you're able to skip questions on this form?"_
_Participant: "Well, it makes it easier. I mean, I'm not old, I mean, I'm old, but I'm not old like a lot of veterans that I see at the hospital. Something like this would make it much easier for those folks. Along with myself.” -P9_



### 2. **Overall Comprehension: Most understood the purpose of the form**
The majority of participants understood the purpose of the form, with the exception of 2 participants: one who said she had suffered a stroke that affected her memory, and the other who did not understand the form in the beginning, possibly due to cognitive considerations.

>_"I think it's very easy to use, like way easy to navigate, and I don't have any issues filling out the form. But I like the definition of each term, like what you need to fill out." -P8_

>_“I like it. It was nice. It's much better than what it used to be. If they use this, it'll be helpful to a lot of people.” - P9_



### 3. **Split reception on the condensed intro page versus the full intro page copy**
In comparing a lean version with the full version of the intro, preference was equally split. Half of the sample of participants preferred the extra information provided on the full introduction explaining each category (example: what are considered assets) to help them prepare, while the other half preferred to see all of the categories grouped together to easily scan visually. 
The majority of participants skipped ahead on the intro page and we recommend removing the alert box that hides the intro page content when viewing on mobile, and keeping both action links to minimize frustration or drop off.<br><br>In our research to date, two archetypes are emerging – users that are very thorough filling out forms and reading every aspect in detail, and users that will skip ahead based on previous familiarity with VA.gov forms and feeling confident with the process. 

> _"Other people they may like prefer this version, like they may not like all the extra stuff. But I would prefer the extra information." -P8_

> _"I would read the second page [condensed intro]. But - It doesn't have enough information about what you're seeking. In your work history. Like the employer's name. Starting end date monthly. Like some people might need help to grab their W2 Or their paystub. You know what I mean?" -P1_

> _“Moderator: "And between these 2 versions, which version do you think is the best for you?"_ 
_"The first one [full intro], cause this one, The second one, it doesn't give you a lot of information. I think the first one gives you examples, I guess, is the word. Because some people might not understand monthly living expenses.” -P9_

### 4. **The cash on hand question was easily understood by all participants**
Participants easily understood the "Cash on hand" question. Specifically, the information in parentheses (“cash not in a bank”) is what helped participants understand the meaning of cash on hand.

>_"Now cash on hand. Not in my bank. So that's asking, "What's in my pocket right now? What's on me?". Well just say I got $50. Which is pretty easy. I mean, most people would know how much money they have currently on them." -P6_

> _Moderator: "What does cash on hand mean to you?"_
_"The amount of cash I have in my wallet. To me, cash on hand means it's what you have that you can get your hands on." -P1_


### 5. **Transition page clarity: Most did not understand the purpose of this page**
This page was added to help orient the user since the progress bar will change. However, it would seem that participants in this study did not notice the progress bar changed. Some focused on the "next steps" portion of the page as opposed to the portion of the page that let them know they were on the expedited path and were skipping steps. Despite not knowing they were skipping steps, those participants had no issues continuing with the form and did not experience any confusion with completing and submitting the form.

    Since the transition page was confusing for some participants, we recommend removing the "next steps" portion to minimize confusion.

>_"It sounds like it's telling me that based on my responses that I'm gonna be eligible for a waiver to get the bills taken care of. It's telling me right now that I am eligible for a waiver. So now I'm happy. So now I'm gonna submit. I'll continue." -P4_


### 6. **Confirmation page and trust: Immediate waiver decision was welcome and surprising**

   Most participants were positively surprised by the immediate feedback on the decision of their request. 
For some participants, at first, there was positive reception when seeing the green checkmark and "You're eligible for a waiver". Then, some felt disappointment when reading the fine print. 
Context: This is an active conversation between VA stakeholders and SMEs and the copy is not final yet. 
Based on what we tested, it's clear that an automatic decision is unfamiliar and surprising, and also would be very positive. 
While at the same time, some participants can't believe it since they haven't seen it done before. 
An email and a letter to confirm and prove this would be helpful. 
One participant expected automatic approval as she compared it to submitting a form for Travel Pay. As we saw in our last study, the term "waiver" was not understood by all participants.

>_"See this is what I’m talking about, this is the ambiguity. I was filling out the form on the assumption I would be approved. This says I’m eligible for a waiver. This is not a reimbursement per se, it is simply a request for a waiver and reimbursement, not that it is automatically approved. That it is being considered. I hate the VA, I'm sorry I do. I spent the last hour… my frame of reference is different because I’ve worked for the government in my professional past and whenever I filled out a reimbursement for travel, in my mind I am going to get that money back. That is the mindset that I am going in with. I am under the assumption that I am going to be reimbursed."  -P2_


>_"So they will automatically know you're eligible for a waiver?"_ 
_Moderator: "How do you feel about that?"_
_"Well, it seems like they would have to review it. The idea is just a shock, I suppose...like in the more positive sense...I feel like the Veterans Administration, I guess, is becoming a little more sensitive to what the Veterans need now. It's taken a little while, but I mean at least it's coming." -P1_


>_"Oh, and it tells you immediately? Does it tell you for real?"_
_Moderator: "How do you feel about that?"_
_"That is awesome. That is, that is way awesome. But this is just a prototype, so, but that would be cool. That would be cool because then you'd go right off the bat. Wouldn't have to sit and wait like I did wait a week thinking that everything's gonna be okay and then get your form sent back to you in the mail [telling you] you're not eligible yet because you haven't submitted this form this paperwork. It would let you know immediately. That's nice." -P9_

<img width="714" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-16 at 11 13 55 AM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/123019973/dca45bc2-9138-468c-8c99-f0bf168d7d39">



## Additional Insights

- A participant brought up that information would be difficult to be received by mail since some Veterans have unstable housing. He recommended also sending the information via email.
> _"'We'll send you this information by mail.' I know some veterans. Have uneasy, or like, uncertain living accommodations so maybe that main part would be difficult for them. And I know we're getting more into the digital age and I don't know if there's some rules or laws about sending it also by email." -P6_

- Make it clear whether Veterans will need to submit a new form if they incur more debt. One Participant asked whether she would need to submit a new form each month as she received her prescription monthly. She received monthly copay bills and noted that her financial situation would not change monthly.

  
## Recommendations
* Intro page: Remove or move [alert box] so that it does not hide important introduction page content that the user needs to see to prepare to fill out the form. We hypothesize that if users are able to see more of the steps "above the fold", they will be more likely to read the intro page.  
* Transition page: Remove "Next steps" content
* Wording and visual language on the confirmation page should be more clear and succinct.
* Send any important information to Veterans via email. As noted by P6, this is important as not all Veterans have stable housing and may miss information sent in the mail.



## Next Steps

_Next steps here. Include owners if appropriate._
- Accessibility study in Fall 2023

## Further research needed

_If there are demographics that were not included in this study or you discovered that more research should be done, make note of that here._

- We met our objective of interviewing participants 55+ for this study.
- We recommend an accessibility study in the Fall 2023 to test with Veterans that use screen readers.
- In light of the (2) participants with cognitive considerations (stroke that affects memory, and other unknown cognitive consideration) who had a hard time with the form, we also recommend that stakeholders consider how participants can get assistance filling out the form if it proves to be difficult.
