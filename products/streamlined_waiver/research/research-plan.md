# Research Plan for Debt Resolution Team, Streamlined Waiver, Transparency, July 2023

## [](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/sharing-research/research-findings-template.md#background)Background

The Streamlined Waiver allows Veterans who meet the qualifications to bypass sections of the Financial Status Report and automatically receive a waiver of their copays. [This Mural](https://app.mural.co/invitation/mural/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1678973946956?sender=ua78f969c4cddcbfe56b27885&key=340ed11b-aab8-42d3-b488-f9abf67b3513) with the different user flows will be the best way to understand all of the paths that users can take. We need to let users know that they may not have to fill out the full form and why they may have bypassed some questions if they meet the qualifications.

Simplifying the process for claiming medical debt forgiveness, VA will streamline the request process and set a simple income threshold for receiving medical debt relief. The request process will include an online option for veterans and reduce the effort required by veterans to access relief. These changes will go into effect in the next 90 to 120 days.

The assumption is that transparency is important, the framing as well as the expectation setting for the streamlined waiver process will be key and contribute to a seamless and satisfying experience for Veterans seeking to resolve their debt. At the same time, our stakeholders have expressed concern that an upfront transparency reveal of the possibility of an automatic waiver could be confusing and upsetting for Veterans if they are deemed not to be eligible. **We also know that 95% of users with VHA debt (copay debt) will be approved for the automatic waiver.**

  

Continuing the [usability study we did in May 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/combined_fsr/research/enhanced_fsr), the Streamlined Waiver usability study is an extension of this work. The Streamlined Waiver offers a revised intro page, offering limited copy in terms of transparency and offering clarity on the required sections the Veteran will be expected to fill out. Furthermore, the Streamlined Waiver will take the Veteran through a dynamic flow unique to their financial and life situation (income limits thresholds, number of dependents, spouse's information, cash on hand).

  
**The additional copy, revised copy, addition of a transition page, and notification page have been designed with the design principle of minimalist design in mind.** Taking into account the length of the form and the fact that users skim content, we seek to make the form's content scannable and easily digestible.

Which  [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md)  does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

This research supports these main [OCTO objectives and goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme):

-   Veterans can manage their health services online
-   Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
-   Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
    

This research supports increasing these measures:

-   Usage of digital, self-service tools
-   Percent of applications submitted online (vs. paper)
-   Completion rate of online transactions
-   Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov
-   Number of VA.gov users as a function of total Veteran population
-   Benefit value (in $) delivered from online applications or transactions

This research supports decreasing these measures:

-   Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution
-   Time to successful complete and submit online transactions
-  Time to process online applications (vs. paper)

Where does your product fit into the  [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)? Are there moments that matter?

  
Other key moments this research touches in the Veteran journey are:

-   Attending to health needs
-   Taking care of myself
-   Managing my declining health

## [](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/sharing-research/research-findings-template.md#research-goals)Research Goals

What are you trying to learn from this research?

_Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies._

  
**Usability study (40 minutes)**

**Test [User Flow for Dan](https://app.mural.co/invitation/mural/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1678973946956?sender=ua78f969c4cddcbfe56b27885&key=340ed11b-aab8-42d3-b488-f9abf67b3513)** (automatic approval flow under GMT)

**Areas being considered:**

-   **New copy (intro page, transition page, confirmation/decision page)**
    
-   **Transition page and progress bar**
    
-   **Review page**
    
-   **Submission confirmation page and automatic waiver decision** (only surfaced if they are approved)
    

***Goal 1: Evaluate the usability of the Streamlined Waiver experience***
Minimize confusion with a “skipped question” transition page

***Goal 2: Evaluate the comprehension of the Streamlined Waiver experience and the new copy additions to the FSR/Streamlined Waiver pages.***

Clarity, and define expectations early to minimize cognitive burden

***Goal 3: Evaluate Veterans trust, and subjective experience of FSR/Streamlined Waiver. Has it changed?***

**Concept test (10 minutes)**

In the last 10 minutes of the usability study interviews, we will do a small concept evaluation in which we seek to understand whether Veterans prefer a lean intro page in terms of copy, or a more extensive intro page. We will prevent both side by side. Where can we backfill content, or cut out redundant content?

### [](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/sharing-research/research-findings-template.md#outcome)Outcome

How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

We will gain confidence that this approach for Streamlined Waiver is clear, understandable, and desirable. We will have an opportunity to make UX adjustments if necessary ( design, copy, and UX adjustments) while our frontend team builds the experience.

### [](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/sharing-research/research-findings-template.md#research-questions)Research questions

Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:

-   What will I do with what I learn from this question?
-   Does this question serve the goals of my study?
-   Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the  [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md)

 1. What do Veterans understand about the FSR form at the intro, as they progress through the form, and at the end of the form?
    
2.  Is it clear from the revised intro page what information they need to provide?
    
3. What is their level of trust through this process and experience? Is it any different from the FSR and eFSR?
    
4.  How do Veterans with medical copay debt understand “Help with your debt” without upfront reveal of the possible outcomes repeated throughout the form (waiver, automatic waiver, or payment plan)
    
* Is the mention of “Help with your debt” only enough to motivate the Veteran to fill out the form? How do Veterans perceive this Help could look like? Does it matter to them?
    
* There is a trade-off, in terms of providing just enough information, so as not to overwhelm Veterans filling out the form, while also being comprehensive.
 
5. What is their level of confidence in the process?
    
6. How do they understand the “Cash in hand” question? What do they understand “Cash in hand” to mean? How clear or unclear is this question?
    
7. How do they feel about the transition between the last section (cash on hand question) and the transition page? How clear is this transition?
    
8. How do they feel about the review page?
    
9. How do they feel about the confirmation page? Is there anything else they would wish to see on this page?

**Concept Evaluation**
- Between the brief intro page and the extensive intro page, which we will show them side by side, which one do they feel is most helpful? Why? 

### [](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/sharing-research/research-findings-template.md#hypothesis)Hypothesis

What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.

-   What do you already know about this problem space?
-   What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
-   Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study.
-   Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

**We hypothesize that:**

-   The revised intro page will be clear
    
-   The form flow will be clear and easy to understand
    
-   The transition page will make sense
    
-   The submission page notification with the reveal of an automatic approval will be well received and maybe even positively surprising.

## [](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/sharing-research/research-findings-template.md#methodology)Methodology

-   Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research
-   Usability testing - appropriate for evaluative research

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the  [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources.

-   [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants)  to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research.
-   [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md)  to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### [](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/sharing-research/research-findings-template.md#recruitment-approach)Recruitment approach

Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?

Pro tip:

-   For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants.
-   Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups.
-   Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this  [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md)  and use the  [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing)  to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.
