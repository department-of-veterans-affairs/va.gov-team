Germany: 3 years

### Warm-up Questions - 3-5 minutes
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
- What device are you using today? I am using the phone. The area I live in we get better receipt on the phone; we don’t get Wi-Fi out here. 
On hotspot: I don’t know what program but all I had to do was click zoom and bring it all up. It worked yesterday but it kept cutting in and out. Today it’s letting me talk but not use the video.
- Does the device you're using have a screen to share? I certainly hope so. 
- What type of screen reader or other assistive technology are you using? I don’t know. I cant see or read it for me. I know they set it up in Birmingham . 
Android device. 
-   How comfortable are you using your screen reader, how long have you been using it? Well when I use it normally it works fine expect when I had a little trouble down there. I don’t know if it’s the microphone that they gave me. 
Normally what type did you use: I have only ever used guide before. 
How do you navigate through a page: it comes up and the verbal part talks to me and tells me what it does and reads it off to me what is on the screen then I can speak back. That’s where I am having the issue. Its not getting my words back. Today I am having all kinds of trouble it seems. 
Keyboard navigation or only speaking: I use the screen board to. The keyboard. 
-   Have you had experience with filling out any online forms with the VA in the past? Yes ma’am. 
    

-   **If yes:**
-   Can you tell me a little about the last time you filled out a form with the VA? It came up where it had a set of answers then it would ask me to enter information and fi it was verbal answers it would read it off otherwise I had to type it in or speak it in to enter it. 
-   How was that experience?
-   Were you able to accomplish your goal? Most of the time yes. A lot of times I will ask my daughter that takes care of me to be there with me as well to help me.

- In the next few questions, I'm going to ask you to rate different aspects of the form you filled out today.
- The first is efficiency and how efficiently you were able to fill out the form. Thinking about whether you were able to fill out the form at a speed you were comfortable with. On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not efficient at all, and 5 being very efficient, how efficient was your experience filling out this form? Why?
- The second is if the form got easier over time as you filled out more sections. On a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being not easy at all, and 5 being very easy, how easy was it to fill out the form the further you progressed? Why?
- The third and last, is whether the form was flexible and easy to navigate back and forwards, and recover from errors. On a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being not flexible at all, and 5 being very flexible, how flexible was this form? Why?
