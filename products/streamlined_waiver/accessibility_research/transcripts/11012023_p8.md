### Intro - 5 minutes

Rapport building

What do you like to do with your free time? 
Where was the best place you visited while in service? Best place I have ever been. I think Korea has been the best place. Well the first time as an African America it was the first time of not feeling any racism. I have been to dark places but there I felt very comfortable and saw you as a human being instead of an ethnic group. That experience was just fantastic and the food isn’t bad either. The people are very strong and you don’t understand how young the United States is. You are look at a country that is 2000 years old and there you look over and you see the footprints of a leader from then. The temple was 2500 years old. 
    
-   I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes. 

### Warm-up Questions - 3-5 minutes
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
- What device are you using today? I am on a desktop. 
- Does the device you're using have a screen to share? Yes. 
- What type of screen reader or other assistive technology are you using? I use JAWS. I have been told; this is the only one I used. I am 1 of a rare handful of people that sue this software. 
-   How comfortable are you using your screen reader, how long have you been using it? Fairly comfortable. If you give me the website I can go there, I can send emails, I can send attachments,. If you ask me to forward it I can do that, I can correspond with people. I can do excel sheets. I am not an expert but I can do it. I found out among my peers I am ahead of them because a lot of them don’t have a smartphone or they aren’t interested in learning about computers. I was on a website and I didn’t take a screenshot to save and send it to myself. Learning the grammar and once you learn it you can put sentences together and learn to navigate it is a continuous learning process. I have used it since 2005.
Complete tasks or navigate: I was looking for; I have a system. The first thing is trying to spell it correctly. Then I highlight everything and copy it and bring windows up, google chrome comes up and I tab until I get to edit, then control p for paste. Whatever I typed is now there. Here’s the fun part just press enter. Then you go to the first header which I learned. Do you mean blank then go down to what you are looking for and enter on that. Then you are at the website. If you need to find link then go to the keypad on the right and the number lock is off then press 0 which is interest. F7 and press that for a list of links on the site. How cool is that. Then arrow down for which one you want and then you are where you want to be. It needs to be spelled correctly because if not google will ask fi you meant this, I try to spell it correctly then just go to the site and it gives you a choice. The top ones are the ones closer. It is like a tree then there are ones that aren’t as looked for then go to the website and start exploring. When you get to the website there are headers and you can look at the list. If there aren’t headers and there aren’t any lists. I know there aren’t headers or list so then I can arrow down until I find what I need if it says list link view there’s a link. Then enter on the link and you are taken right there. 
-   Have you had experience with filling out any online forms with the VA in the past? I can say I have not. I haven’t had I look forward to doing it. Well I just haven’t had to or maybe it’s because I haven’t really, I go to the va a lot. We get a ton of information there and more often than not our vis coordinator doesn’t tell us to go to the website. I am not saying tis a bad thing. 
    
- #### Optional Question - If they have experience with VA copay or overpayment debt
Today I will be taking you through a form to help with VA debt. First, I’d like to briefly hear about your experiences with VA debt.

What has been your most recent experience with VA copay or overpayment debt? N/A
#### Task Overview
-  Imagine that you have a VA copay debt. Imagine you've been experiencing financial hardship and are having difficulty repaying the copay. Through some research, you find out that you can fill out the VA Financial Status Report Form to request help with this debt.
-   We will be asking you to fill out sections of this form where it will ask for things like your address and financial information.
-   If you do not feel comfortable sharing any personal information, you can enter fake information.
    
## FSR (Streamlined Waiver) [Tasks - 30-40 minutes]

**[Task 1:] As you move through the steps, please do your best to think out loud and let us know what is particularly clear or particularly unclear or challenging about the way the form is structured. I will mostly be observing, and I may ask you to pause at certain points and ask you questions.**

### [Step 0 ] Introduction Page [Follow these steps to request help]
It tells us the title, arrow down. Insert f7 for the links on the page. I get the same message. (Reading page) That’s really good the talk to the veteran crisis line, that’s wonderful that’s there. Youd be surprised how many of our guys are in an emotional place. Contact us is important, normally I would click on the sign in button. It says navigation region is ending so that what you have there. This says breadcrumb navigation regions, I don’t know what that means. If I click enter it would cake me home. Oh manage va debt. We are out of breadcrumbs. That tells me I can manage overpayments and copay bills. We are listed as catastrophic due to President Obama what that meant before vision impairment you would apply and still have to pay copays. Once he changed the listing that meant we didn’t need to worry about copays. 
-   What would you say is the purpose of this page? I know this is the status report but I want to know about the links so I will do the search. A link list came up and there is a list associated with it . I go home and arrow down. Contact us is important because if you have a question or confused to can contact them. 6 of 63 links, there are a lot of links  here. Homeless veteran, veteran women. I would like to know about that one (Doing business with VA)
Thoughts: this is the first time I am actually having to navigate this page. The first thing I like is contact us because if you are concerned and I like the idea if a veteran is in crisis that is important. People that look at this are concerned about veteran mental heath

On VA.gov before: No. I don’t need to visit the website. I have not used this before. Were at the bottom now that it got to the social media. There are a lot of useful;, information here. 
What would you do next: I assume there is something I need to do here. VA.gov isn’t working right now. 
I look for fields but JAWS told me there was.

Okay I am where I was before. There are no edit boxes on this form. There are content but nowhere for you to enter information. 

#### [Step 1 ] Veteran Information
That’s the veteran information. So financial status report, I am assuming I am filling this out so the va knows my financial status and that’s why I am filling this out. I go to this and I have to submit this for help. I am at the top of it I will arrow down. The same information about the crisis line. 
Here it sats about overpayment or copay bills. Okay for this is Hayden Decker’s information. This is the file number. You can go back and finish this later is useful. They may not have all of the information at this time so that button that say you can go back alter is very helpful. You could start where this is and continue. You don’t have to figure it out and restart the process again. 
#### Debt Selection
I will control alt and go to the top. Theres no edit boxes on this page. I like that it goes back t talk to the veteran crisis line because it reminds them just in case they forgot there’s a crisis line if its needed. I think that should be repeated often. There are a few headers on here. Those headers are important because it tells me what the va can help me with. 
Thoughts so far: Well I can only tell you as a JAWS user. I am finding that JAWS is telling me the headers, lists, buttons. It is giving me useful information as a JAWS user. I find it easy to navigate. I find it easy to manipulate. The fact that you are in crisis and need to talk I cannot say how often that needs to be repeated. Someone may have thought they heard it and if they go onto the next page and they hear it any may think they need help or just to remind you that you are able to talk to someone. It is very important. You may not realize it but I had someone work for me and he was fantastic. He was brilliant. I talked to him every other day and thought we hit it off well he knew my children and everyone loved him. One day he committed suicide. It didn’t see the stressors. I didn’t see it coming. All I am saying is having lived that experience and having that there is good. There may be a women with MST or cant handle vision loss we don’t know. Having that reminder there is important.  I learned that even when you think you know someone you don’t. I didn’t know anything was wrong. I had no idea he never seemed depressed. The worst thing is that they don’t press the button but if they do you might be saving someone’s life. I am finding it useful because again I never used this before. 
-   What is this page asking you to do?

#### Contact Information
You can edit the number field. Let me say this, I am finding in my community of vision low. I am learning that not only guys have email but veterans in their 90’a have emails, WWII forget it. So people like me use email but not everyone uses it. It’s important that its there. A friend of mine is a tech person told me that they needed to host a meeting but didn’t have zoom or teams. You will leave people out. There are people with flip phones. Skype worked beautifully. If you can answer the phone they can be in the meeting. It made it a level playing field. Don’t assume because people don’t have it, it might be financial reasons. The VA may provide tools but they aren’t going to pay for email ad stuff. Then there are people that even if we don’t like it we have to mee them where there at. You have to me them where they are at if you want them to participate. Think of it like this if you’ve ever had an old lady dial into a station. Okay, back in the old days for radio you had to dial in to find out where you are. People are the same, you have to dial into their frequency. You’re on FM and they’re on AM, you will never talk to them.
