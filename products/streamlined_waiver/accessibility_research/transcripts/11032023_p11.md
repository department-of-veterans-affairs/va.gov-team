### Intro - 5 minutes

Rapport building

Where was the best place you visited while in service?  Tokyo. Because it was a more advanced and progressive city than I thought. 
Years: I was there in 1981. I was there for 18 months. I was stationed in northern Japan in the mountains so when I took leave I went to Tokyo and it was different. Where I was you know it was slow and really wasn’t to many public type areas and most places even had outhouses. Tokyo had tall buildings and bullet trains. Everyone I came in contact with spoke English. It not what it is now but they were out there. 
    
-   I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes

### Warm-up Questions - 3-5 minutes
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
- What device are you using today? Apple desktop a Mac. 
- Does the device you're using have a screen to share? Yes. I have to toggle around for it but yes. 
- What type of screen reader or other assistive technology are you using? Voiceover
-   How comfortable are you using your screen reader, how long have you been using it? I am very comfortable using it, I have been using it for 10 years. 
Accomplish tasks: Well on the desktop it is by keyboard. On the phone it’s swipe and touch gestures. 
-   Have you had experience with filling out any online forms with the VA in the past? Yes but it has been a year or two. 
    

-   **If yes:**
-   Can you tell me a little about the last time you filled out a form with the VA? It was an application to sports clinics and you know that was the first time it was online. We had the meeting and they swore they tested it and it was 100 percent accessible. It wasn’t and the day of registration the high volume of traffic crashed the site. 
-   How was that experience?
-   Were you able to accomplish your goal? No they had to cancel that process and had a member call to do it over the phone with the VA staff. It wasn’t completely accessible, when you got to a page the screen reader would read the information but when it came to making the selection as far a toggling to push buttons it didn’t pick up on the switch box or the box. It would read it but not interact to make a selection. 
Read form but not make selections: yes. If it was yes or no it would read the question and it would say yes. It was a check box and the screen reader would say unchecked but there was no way to interact with the box to check it. Some sighted users could use the mouse to click and it would work but I couldn’t get it to work with my screen reader. 
    
- #### Optional Question - If they have experience with VA copay or overpayment debt
Today I will be taking you through a form to help with VA debt. First, I’d like to briefly hear about your experiences with VA debt.

What has been your most recent experience with VA copay or overpayment debt? Um actually since I was rated catastrophic for vision the copay portion has ceased. I haven’t had a copay in about 8 years. No. 

#### Task Overview
-  Imagine that you have a VA copay debt. Imagine you've been experiencing financial hardship and are having difficulty repaying the copay. Through some research, you find out that you can fill out the VA Financial Status Report Form to request help with this debt.
-   We will be asking you to fill out sections of this form where it will ask for things like your address and financial information.
-   If you do not feel comfortable sharing any personal information, you can enter fake information.
    
## FSR (Streamlined Waiver) [Tasks - 30-40 minutes]

**[Task 1:] As you move through the steps, please do your best to think out loud and let us know what is particularly clear or particularly unclear or challenging about the way the form is structured. I will mostly be observing, and I may ask you to pause at certain points and ask you questions.**

### [Step 0 ] Introduction Page [Follow these steps to request help]
That right there I guess I need to get to the sign in button for it to make sense. So that right there explains everything that you need to fill the form out. Social security, VA pay, two pay stubs if you are working. I am not sure on the wording as far as I would have questions that it says you and your spouse if you have one. 
Thoughts: It is a lot of information but the information you get, once I got into the information needed then when I got here it went step by step and was clear on what I needed. Once thing that I like about it is that there’s a feature that you can pause and resume it. If you are going through this and you are missing information you can go get that information or have a few days to look for it without starting all over. 
Got clear, what made it feel that way: Well um when they were asking the information I was thinking what for. That was the header group before then when I read it and it said you know it kind of made it seem that the va needed or would like to help with the debt but you need all of the financial information to make the decision. It is clear as to why then you know it makes it seem like reading this form if you are in this situation they want to do everything they can to help resolve the issue.

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
-   Overall, how was your experience with the form?  
-   For context: we are trying to improve the form navigation; if you had a magic wand and could change anything about this form- what would it be?
-   Were you ever confused about anything on the form?
    
-   **If No:**
-   What made you confident?

-   **If Yes:**
-   What would have helped make that more clear?
-   What was the easiest part about the form if anything?

- In the next few questions, I'm going to ask you to rate different aspects of the form you filled out today.
- The first is efficiency and how efficiently you were able to fill out the form. Thinking about whether you were able to fill out the form at a speed you were comfortable with. On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not efficient at all, and 5 being very efficient, how efficient was your experience filling out this form? Why?
- The second is if the form got easier over time as you filled out more sections. On a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being not easy at all, and 5 being very easy, how easy was it to fill out the form the further you progressed? Why?
- The third and last, is whether the form was flexible and easy to navigate back and forwards and recover from errors. On a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being not flexible at all, and 5 being very flexible, how flexible was this form? Why?
    
-   Do you have any questions for me?
