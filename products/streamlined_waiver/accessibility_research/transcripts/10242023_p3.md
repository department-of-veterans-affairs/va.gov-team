### Warm-up Questions - 3-5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
- What device are you using today?  PC
- Does the device you're using have a screen to share? Yes but I am assuming we can do it off zoom. I don’t know how to do it without zoom. 
- What type of screen reader or other assistive technology are you using? Dolphin Guide. 
-   How comfortable are you using your screen reader, how long have you been using it? Very comfortable using it and have been suing it for a while. Different versions but since 2005-2006 something like that. 
Forms:    Over the internet it will have a text box and click on enter when you get the box and enter in what you want to. Then most of the time I tab out then go into the next box. It depends on the form and the challenges but that’s normally how it works. Tabbing through the form. 
-   Have you had experience with filling out any online forms with the VA in the past? Yes and I cant think of one in particular. It was my myHealtheVet .com I guess it’s the va website. Even this session I filled out forms for the va. 

-   **If yes:**
-   Can you tell me a little about the last time you filled out a form with the VA? It was for this meeting when Shannon sent out the email about the meeting. I had to fill out things on the website to do the consent form. I can’t remember everything I have done but that’s the last one I did. 
-   How was that experience? It’s alright. Sometimes have issues with the consent form but normally I can do it. If I have a helper here a sighted helper can look and see it on the screen. I don’t remember if we did that or not for the consent form. It seems like filling out the actual consent there was an issue with that. 
    
- #### Optional Question - If they have experience with VA copay or overpayment debt
Today I will be taking you through a form to help with VA debt. First, I’d like to briefly hear about your experiences with VA debt: Nothing recent at all. I think years ago when I went to the va they charged me for something and it was 20 dollars which was resolved quickly. I haven’t had issues with copays recently and all of the medical is taken care of. 
Process: I don’t even remember it was very small and resolved quickly. Its been 15-20 years ago. 
Last year my mother got sick in August of 2022 and I went to FL and because we had to walk form the parking garage to the hospital I overextended my leg and they didn’t have a doctor there to I had to go to Denver. I was trying to get travel pay but that was never resolved because I gave up on it. 
Travel pay that was not taken care of: correct. I cant remember it much I know filling it out was an issue and I couldn’t find the information they needed should I say. My mother passed away in September and my father in November so it wasn’t a great end of year. 

#### Task Overview

-  Imagine that you have a VA copay debt. Imagine you've been experiencing financial hardship and are having difficulty repaying the copay. Through some research, you find out that you can fill out the VA Financial Status Report Form to request help with this debt.
-   We will be asking you to fill out sections of this form where it will ask for things like your address and financial information.
-   If you do not feel comfortable sharing any personal information, you can enter fake information.

## FSR (Streamlined Waiver) [Tasks - 30-40 minutes]

**[Task 1:] As you move through the steps, please do your best to think out loud and let us know what is particularly clear or particularly unclear or challenging about the way the form is structured. I will mostly be observing, and I may ask you to pause at certain points and ask you questions.**


### [Step 0 ] Introduction Page [Follow these steps to request help]
-   What would you say is the purpose of this page? I think I clicked on va disability, I clicked on that. Went to start request. Okay ill stop here for a minutes because I was at the top of the form and it asked what it relates to. 
Could you go to the financial status report page: I clicked that but it didn’t send  me anywhere so now I am scrolling through the various ways. 

Go away and click start request now. It is asking me to sign in to save work. 
Can you hear what it is saying. It just says black square instead of telling me what it is. I only know that there’s a text box. 
Does it typically read black square in other forms: When I do it on PC I don’t have many issues but I do have issues logging in with va.gov. I have to do it once or twice to get signed in. its been awhile since I have done it. Then leaving a message for my doctors is difficult and it takes a few times. Here on mobile it is saying black square. Its giving me options for sign in purpose. ID.me. What its not giving me on the phone is the keyboard to sign in. That’s frustrating. That’s what I was saying about the accessibility for apps on the phone. I think my phone is fairly new and I keep it updated. I have this issue with other sites on the iPhone. I know with uber its been an issue as well and a few others. I don’t know until I am on a website or an app.

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- In the next few questions, I'm going to ask you to rate different aspects of the form you filled out today.
- The first is efficiency and how efficiently you were able to fill out the form. Thinking about whether you were able to fill out the form at a speed you were comfortable with. On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not efficient at all, and 5 being very efficient, how efficient was your experience filling out this form? Why?
- The second is if the form got easier over time as you filled out more sections. On a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being not easy at all, and 5 being very easy, how easy was it to fill out the form the further you progressed? Why?
- The third and last, is whether the form was flexible and easy to navigate back and forwards, and recover from errors. On a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being not flexible at all, and 5 being very flexible, how flexible was this form? Why?
    
-   Do you have any questions for me?
