### Intro - 5 minutes
    
-   I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes Ma’am. 

### Warm-up Questions - 3-5 minutes
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.	
Where was the best place you visited in service: Turkey, I lived there for two years and it was wonderful. The people were very friendly and it was a nice place. I was there 95- 96. Right around the. 
- What device are you using today? I have  a Mac. 
- Does the device you're using have a screen to share? Yes.
- What type of screen reader or other assistive technology are you using? I will be using voiceover on the mac. I am not as skilled as others as listening to all of the talking in the background when talking to others. 
-   How comfortable are you using your screen reader, how long have you been using it? I am more comfortable with voiceover on the phone than on the Mac. I have gone to the va and requested more training. If it is in front of my face I can read some of the screen but my vision ahs became worse and I am using voice over more. 
More comfortable on the phone then mac: Yes.
Adobe has its own reading system inside. I see these and I am like let me push it. Gmail ahs its own reader as well. If the app ahs a reader inside of it I sue that instead. 
On mac do you use voice normally: Um probably about 20 percent of the time. If it is reading a few words I read but if it is length I use voiceover. 
How do you navigate a page: It is different . voice over is different for app and pages. Um. You know for a webpage it will just go across or I will click on it. Sometimes I will select the text for it to read it to me. I have a vision I can click on different areas. I only have peripheral vision. 
-   Have you had experience with filling out any online forms with the VA in the past? Yes I have. 
    
-   **If yes:** 
-   Can you tell me a little about the last time you filled out a form with the VA? It was the winter clinic form for the nation disabled veterans form. I downloaded it to my computer and um filled it out.
-   How was that experience? It was okay. It was adobe so. I have my adobe reader. 
-   Were you able to accomplish your goal?

    
- #### Optional Question - If they have experience with VA copay or overpayment debt
Today I will be taking you through a form to help with VA debt. First, I’d like to briefly hear about your experiences with VA debt. 

What has been your most recent experience with VA copay or overpayment debt? Yes originally when  I was with the va I was 30 percent before I went blind. I had copays of 1.50 or something like that. So they would tell me I owed them then they took it out of my pay. I never did the paperwork because it was a dollar or 7. 
I never requested help but I encouraged others to do it. 

#### Task Overview
-  Imagine that you have a VA copay debt. Imagine you've been experiencing financial hardship and are having difficulty repaying the copay. Through some research, you find out that you can fill out the VA Financial Status Report Form to request help with this debt.
-   We will be asking you to fill out sections of this form where it will ask for things like your address and financial information.
-   If you do not feel comfortable sharing any personal information, you can enter fake information.
    
## FSR (Streamlined Waiver) [Tasks - 30-40 minutes]

**[Task 1:] As you move through the steps, please do your best to think aloud and let us know what is particularly clear or particularly unclear or challenging about the way the form is structured. I will mostly be observing, and I may ask you to pause at certain points and ask you questions.**

### [Step 0 ] Introduction Page [Follow these steps to request help]
Thoughts: it had a lot of threatening, scarry concepts in there. You wanted to know about my assets and then later on it said they wont take a home or other things away from you. Then why would you ask, knowing it then of course you’d take them. You said imagine that I was in debt. In the concept that language was scary especially hearing it because there was something about jewelry. Like what really. It is a lot of um listening to it was just a lot all of the we may ask you then listing it all on one page where I should start filling it out. I see that you are prepping people to have it for filling it out. You are the va you are asking for it then it said fi you need help contact a VSO. I am thinking oh my god do you know how hard it is to see those people. It takes a long time to see one or you need to get up really early to sit at the va. My friend got there ay 730 and sat there for 7 hours waiting to see someone. If I need help tis like I might as well forget needing help if that’s my option. Then later on you have the phone numbers to call. I don’t know how to the va would help if the first person you tell me to contact is a VSO.     

#### [Step 1 ] Veteran Information
-   Is there anything confusing on this page or something you are unsure of?
    
#### Debt Selection
-   What is this page asking you to do?

#### Contact Information

#### Spouse Information
Am I married. Oh okay, selected yes. It is hard to get into why does my marital status matter. I am clicking inside the box but its not working and I have tried the keyboard commands. Tab skips over it. It jumps to this one. I clicked the button. Arrowed down and there’s a little black box but its not selecting anything or reading it. If you click the box it will read it but will not read it as the box scrolls over the text. 

#### Your Spouse Information
-   Is there anything so far that is unclear or confusing? If so, what?

#### Your Dependents
It wont let me put the number 1. That was odd. It wont let me use my number pad on my keyboard. I have ran into that before. 
It’s  a mac keyboard and there’s no number lock. okey. 
-   Imagine you are unsure of who qualifies as a dependent: expanded. Um I had to click on it whereas the other one didn’t. 

#### Dependents Ages
How are you feeling at this point: frustrated. 
What parts: just trying to read the drop-down links has been frustrating. 
#### [Step 2 ] Household Income
Work History

Add a job
Your job at [Name] - Date you started work at this job?
I think I skipped something but I don’t know how. I tried hitting shift tab. It jumped ahead; can I go backwards. I would look for a back button and I don’t see it or hear it. 
Can you try cancel: That would stop everything in the form I think. Theres the back but I don’t know how I got there. Why is there back now but there wasn’t one before. This is the one I was in before. Yes this one has a canceled whereas the other has a back. 
It wont let me use the number pad but it might just be the mac keyboard. 	
Why does it say update employment record. It should say continue or submit. 

**Monthly income for [Job]**
-   For income, I’m going to ask that you enter “0”.
      Okay that’s interesting. 
Your job at [Job] - payroll deductions

Payroll deductions amounts
Wow it went completely out of it. If I hit the wrong button and I thought I was in there but it selected continue or back and I didn’t know I was there.
I have having issues reading the text elements again. Okay. I have having issues reading the line above it. It goes from your job at VCA and then its not jumping to the next line to read it. This goes back to my other one. Okay. 
 
Your work history [summary card]
-   What would you say is the purpose of this page? It didn’t read, I had issues reading the work history tab. It went to edit instead of the text above it at first. 

#### Your VA benefits
-   What is this page telling you? I went from benefits them went into the phone number. It skipped everything else. 
Would you expect that with tab to go to the next line: I would have thought it would be t another heading or line. It jumped into the box and only read the number. I don’t get any va benefits now I’m really mad. 
It jumped again; it went from continue to another phone number under help. It keeps jumping to phone numbers. 
    
#### Your other income
-   Is there anything confusing on this page or something you are unsure of? Again the help thing is acting the same way. I am surprised that there’s no explanation like for retirement or non-va pension payments. 
What kind of explanations would you like: what they are I guess. I guess I am sue to that on the IRS pages. 

#### Spouse’s work history

#### Spouse’s VA benefits

#### Spouse’s Other Income
-   Is there anything confusing on this page or something you are unsure of? 
My screen reader jumps from the title to the selection. I can’t read the line above it. The other ones where the choices were yes or no it would eventually read the line above it.. Okay there it goes I had to get the box up there to read it. 
Again it didn’t read the green box for me. That green box comes and goes. It flashes. I don’t know if you saw that. See. So every time I check something is it saving it since it is saving it. I don’t know if it is changing the page. 

How do you feel about the flash: it bothers me because it seems like I should be looking at it. If it flashes I should look at it. I don’t know what to do with it because it is flashing and not treating it like text. When it flashes you want to know what it is saying. I cant see what it says but I know it is flashing. 

#### Cash on Hand
Same thing. It is skipping the line above. I am trying to skip up to read something and it says I made an error because I didn’t enter anything in the box. It’s not letting me read under cash on hand. It is the explanation I know. 


#### Cash in Bank
Is this a different page because I can’t read the text under again. 

#### [Step 3]: Transition Page
-   What is this page telling you? Theres a blue box but it wont let me read it. It’s not reading it for me either. 
    
#### [Step 4] Review Page
Okay. It is not selecting it and jumps to the phone number. It doesn’t read what I select. There we go. It is only reading it after I leave it. 
-   What is this page asking you to do? This is what I have entered and saved. If you hit the buttons it will tell you what I have entered so I can review what I have entered
-   Is there anything confusing on this page or something you are unsure of? 
-   What would you do to submit your request? Check the box. Submit my request. Now it is asking for my name. I don’t know how to spell their name. Do I need to read the privacy policy. 
    

#### [Step 5]- Approval Page
It jumps right over everything to a phone number. 
-   What is this page telling you?
-   Is there anything confusing on this page or something you are unsure of?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
-   Overall, how was your experience with the form? Um it was frustrating because the screen reader was skipping over things and not reading them to me. The continue and the back was frustrating because to me I am in the form but it looks like the cancel it was a form within a form which Is confusing because I am only in one. Then the text didn’t go to then it would go from the header to options instead of reading the title of the options for me. 
-   For context: we are trying to improve the form navigation; if you had a magic wand and could change anything about this form- what would it be? However it is formatted in the system or if okay this is what I would do. Have it built into the form for it to be read to you. My Gmail reads it to me. Adobe has its own reader. A lot of the news stations have it to where it will read it to you. I don’t know if that’s possible or not. Why do I need an entire screen reader, why can’t you just read it to me. 
-   Were you ever confused about anything on the form?

- In the next few questions, I'm going to ask you to rate different aspects of the form you filled out today.
- The first is efficiency and how efficiently you were able to fill out the form. Thinking about whether you were able to fill out the form at a speed you were comfortable with. On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not efficient at all, and 5 being very efficient, how efficient was your experience filling out this form? Why?  Probably a 2 because I had to keep clicking in the form because it didn’t flow. The steps didn’t flow for me from one step to the next. 
- The second is if the form got easier over time as you filled out more sections. On a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being not easy at all, and 5 being very easy, how easy was it to fill out the form the further you progressed? Why? Probably a 3 because I started to understand the continue, back and cancel button and when it jumped ahead. I wasn’t sure if it jumped ahead or went back because I don’t know where I am in the form in my head. 
- The third and last, is whether the form was flexible and easy to navigate back and forwards and recover from errors. On a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being not flexible at all, and 5 being very flexible, how flexible was this form? Why? A three. It was good it didn’t kick me out entirely but the use of the commands were a bit confusing. If it says cancel I think its canceling the entire form. 
    
-   Do you have any questions for me? No Ma’am
