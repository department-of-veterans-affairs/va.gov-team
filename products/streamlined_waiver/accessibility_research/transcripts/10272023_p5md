- #### Optional Question - If they have experience with VA copay or overpayment debt
Today I will be taking you through a form to help with VA debt. First, I’d like to briefly hear about your experiences with VA debt.: N/A

What has been your most recent experience with VA copay or overpayment debt? N/A

#### Task Overview

-  Imagine that you have a VA copay debt. Imagine you've been experiencing financial hardship and are having difficulty repaying the copay. Through some research, you find out that you can fill out the VA Financial Status Report Form to request help with this debt.
    
-   We will be asking you to fill out sections of this form where it will ask for things like your address and financial information.
    
-   If you do not feel comfortable sharing any personal information, you can enter fake information.

I will give you a user email and password that you can use to login.

## FSR (Streamlined Waiver) [Tasks - 30-40 minutes]
**[Task 1:] As you move through the steps, please do your best to think aloud and let us know what is particularly clear or particularly unclear or challenging about the way the form is structured. I will mostly be observing, and I may ask you to pause at certain points and ask you questions.**

### [Step 0 ] Introduction Page 
Skipped the previous page, why: You mean the radio buttons you mean. 
The previous page had content but you skipped because there was a link: Yeah it said start the process now. Is that what you mean. I went right to think link because that’s what I wanted to do. I am not big on reading lists of things. If I was doing this form for people like me the link should be below this because if I see the start now link I will start it. 
-   What would you say is the purpose of this page? This is the stuff I will need. This seems to skip to different parts of the page on its own. Its not reading form the top to bottom. When I navigate because I’m impatient I use H for headings. To use arrow to read down, I have been here already. I am reading down by arrows now but I can click control until it shuts up. So is that link in two places or just in this place. I would get rid of the first one if you want me to read this. That would be confusing. I listen to screen readers all the time I don’t want to listen more than I have to. If I start here and if I needed to read this I would think it was on the next page. If you don’t want me to start there don’t put it there. 
-   Please go ahead and start the form 

#### [Step 1 ] Veteran Information
Would this be a part I fill out myself. It pulled it all from my login. When it’s me when I get here I hope there’s nothing else because I wont read it. I hit h to get to the first heading. I listen to the heading so I can move around faster. 
-   Is there anything confusing on this page or something you are unsure of?

#### Debt Selection
-   What is this page asking you to do? So I read down here and I don’t know if its in two places. It says to choose one or more. That line there is redundant. I got what if my debts not listed, I don’t know if it’s there twice or if that’s the screen reader reading it twice. I thought that because I think this field in my coding days it use to be a radio button group. That’s not a big deal. I know I have done this once more recently. It may have been on the va site and like the step process and know how long is left. I like that. 

#### Contact Information
That was clear to me. 

#### Spouse Information  
  Do you want me to answer these. Does it matter if I am married or not. That one right there it says spouse information, if I click no then it shouldn’t say anything about spouse because not I am confused. I expect to see spouse information. I know it said group end so it’s something with eh control group. I would expect the spouse information here. 

#### Your Spouse Information
That all worked perfectly fine, do you want me to fill it out. 
-   Is there anything so far that is unclear or confusing? 

#### Your Dependents
My preference for this is my screen reader is staying in farms mode. That depends how you have jaws I like it to drop so I can arrow. If I was going to another page continue. But that’s a screen reader preference I guess. 
-   Imagine you are unsure of who qualifies as a dependent
-   There is a help section on the page to help understand the definition of a dependent: Yeah those links are there that I hardly ever read. If you need help you can find them. 
Why don’t you read it: Well because I know who qualifies as a dependent it is a straightforward term btu in blended houses it might not be. 
-   Please try to find the section and please comment on how easy or difficult it was to find it.

#### Dependents Ages
 I am a bit confused because if I enter in information for dependents and I said I had one child should there be 2 spots. Oh that’s the issue I wasn’t listening. 

#### [Step 2 ] Household Income
Work History
So when tabbing to one field to another. I give the employer. I have to tab or it wont do anything. I have no idea what I am saying yes to. I would need to go all the way back up to read the page. Now that’s not unusual for this site compared to other. I don’t know if it is a screen reader issue or a website developer thing. Why do I now have cancel or add employment record instead of it saying continue. This is confusing it’s like I dropped out and now doing something different. I hit cancel and it still says yes but I can continue to the next thing, that’s confusing. 
Clear when the form started after the wizard or unclear: no it ahs been clear the entire time but then changed because I answered something a certain way. No matter how I answer it, it should have continue and save for later. Then maybe work history on the next page. The wizard only changed because I checked a button so it confused me. I don’t know why I don’t need to enter it now. Now I have my normal wizard. 
I guess that was my fault, I wasn’t paying enough attention. Before I checked the radio button it made more sense, tell us about the job then we have to enter the information and go next. Now it changed again. Okay so I’m old and I cant remember things. 
I think that was mostly my fault I guess. Partly it comes form me, when in a farm and you’ll get different information than when you are arrowing through the form and  it has nothing to do with the website it deals with the screen reader. If I want to enter information some people go to the form it goes to farm mode automatically but I have it set not to so I can read and see if there’s extra information. If it jumps into farm mode then you can only tab or enter the arrows don’t work. Tis a personal preference for me. 
More control of what’s read: yes I like to tab through first to know what it will ask first then I go start the form. If I click e for edit I can do that. I have a friend that’s not a JAWS power user so they might like it better that way. 
Your job at [Name] - Date you started work at this job? 
I am just hitting tab. 

**Monthly income for [Job]**
-   For income, I’m going to ask that you enter 500.

Your job at [Job] - payroll deductions
That was confusing I don’t know what it just happened. I was in farms mode then when I got out it took me somewhere else. Does any of this mean much to do, does it matter what I select and what I don’t. 

Payroll deductions amounts

Your work history [summary card]
-   What would you say is the purpose of this page? It still comes back to the information if I get better information if I turn farms off and arrow through it. Otherwise it read the one line but it didn’t make sense. I couldn’t go back until I turned off farms. Once I did that and read it, it made sense. When I get back here I just need to click continue. Its one of those farms mode things. Personally I think if JAWS could let me tab or type I would be happier. 
Happier not having to turn it off and on: If it would just read it consistently without farms mode. I guess that’s right. If jaws would read everything that would be fine but it reads differently depending on the toggle. 

#### Your VA benefits
-   What is this page telling you? arrowing down again. That was alright because I didn’t expect to enter anything there. 

    


#### Your other income
Does this matter to you. 	
-   Is there anything confusing on this page or something you are unsure of?

#### Spouse’s work history

#### Spouse’s VA benefits

#### Spouse’s Other Income    
-   Is there anything confusing on this page or something you are unsure of?

#### Cash on Hand
That’s a lot of work for 16 bucks. 
How are you feeling about this so far: Would I keep going for 16 dollars. Theres a certain point where my times worth it or not, all this for 16 dollars is not worth it but everyone’s different. This is a lot of information. I guess this means I am trying not to pay this for some reason. 

Farms mode should turn off because there’s nothing to fill out. 
#### Cash in Bank

#### [Step 3]: Transition Page
-   What is this page telling you?
-   Is there anything confusing on this page or something you are unsure of?
    

#### [Step 4] Review Page

Why is it saying button collapse. Its not a button it says it’s a heading so I don’t understand any of that. See the heading and where it sats number three. It should say collapsed because it’s a header not a button. This should tell me I am signing a document. 
-   What is this page asking you to do?
-   Is there anything confusing on this page or something you are unsure of?
-   What would you do to submit your request?
    

#### [Step 5]- Approval Page
-   What is this page telling you?
-   Is there anything confusing on this page or something you are unsure of?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
-   Overall, how was your experience with the form? I think the form is pretty good. The issues I am having deal with the screen reader not the form. 
-   For context: we are trying to improve the form navigation; if you had a magic wand and could change anything about this form- what would it be? I don’t know I think its fine you know. Back to the previous screen when I lost you there were a drop down that would have shown what I already entered. It was in a heading but a drop down instead a list. I didn’t know if I could hit enter. Normally I wouldn’t hit enter in a header. I would take the drop down out of the heading. You are putting to form elements into the same thing and that confuses me. There are some people that don’t listen to any of that. 
-   Were you ever confused about anything on the form?
    
-   **If No:**

-   What made you confident?
    

-   **If Yes:**
-   What would have helped make that more clear?
-   What was the easiest part about the form if anything?

- In the next few questions, I'm going to ask you to rate different aspects of the form you filled out today.
- The first is efficiency and how efficiently you were able to fill out the form. Thinking about whether you were able to fill out the form at a speed you were comfortable with. On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not efficient at all, and 5 being very efficient, how efficient was your experience filling out this form? Why? Probably a 3 to a 4. Sometimes I don’t like the wizards. I personally would rather have it on one big form to fill it out like it I were doing it by hand. The wizard are extra steps and you will enter it if you need some places it was helpful and other times it was confusing because you have to jump in and out of modes. If I could arrow the entire page and then go fill it out, it would have been easier for me. 
- The second is if the form got easier over time as you filled out more sections. On a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being not easy at all, and 5 being very easy, how easy was it to fill out the form the further you progressed? Why? 5 because I knew what to expect. 
- The third and last, is whether the form was flexible and easy to navigate back and forwards and recover from errors. On a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being not flexible at all, and 5 being very flexible, how flexible was this form? Why? It was a 5 because it gave the option to go back and then drop out to go to the top. I have been on some forms where you enter something then you are stuck.

Other forms: I think if it’s a wizard form it works as others do. They operated as I thought they would and JAWS read everything. Sometimes they don’t read properly. You accessibility is good. 

Want all questions on one page: Yes ideally. If I were filling something out they don’t put each separate question on a different page
You prefer it all at once: yes. 
    
-   Do you have any questions for me? No I think you are doing good with accessibility. I knew where it was, there are some places that were tweaked a bit but it was very accessible.
