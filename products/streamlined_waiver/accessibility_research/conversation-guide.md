### Intro - 5 minutes

-   Welcome! Thank you so much for your time today.  My name is Charlotte - it's great to meet you! 
    How are you today?
    
-   I want to share a little bit about me: I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. [purpose]
    
-   This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services. [meaning]
    
-   My goal today is to learn how easy or difficult it is to use the form we have created using a screen reader. I don't use screen reader technology myself, but my colleague, Angela, uses a screen reader and is on the call to provide assistance if you need it
    
-   We ask that you please be honest with your feedback. [topic]

    #### Observer consent

-   You’ll notice there are a few people on the call already. They’re my colleagues and they’re here to take notes and to assist with technical difficulties that come up during the interview.
-   I also have a few additional observers in the waiting room who would like to listen today.
-   Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?

-    If no:
    

-    ➡️ use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    

-    If yes:
    

-    ➡️ admit observers and ask them to briefly introduce themselves [permission] 
    
-   Your comfort and wellbeing are very important to us. Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. You will be compensated for your time regardless.
    
-   If you don't feel comfortable answering any questions, please let me know and we can move on. [comfort  and  consent]
    
-   Your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]
    
    

#### Recording consent

-   Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
    
-   We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    
-   If yes:

-    Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
  
-    ➡️ *Start recording
    
-   I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?


-   Do you have any questions for me? [opportunity  to  ask  questions]
    
-   Just want to ensure the next 90 minutes are still good for you today? [time  expectations]
  

_I’d love to ask a question to get to know you before we start the interview.

**Rapport building
**
-   What do you like to do with your free time? OR Where was the best place you visited while in service? OR Did you got to any international bases? Where were you stationed during your service?
    

### Warm-up Questions - 3-5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- What device are you using today?

- Does the device you're using have a screen to share?

- What type of screenreader or other assistive technology are you using? (Voiceover? Something else?)

-   How comfortable are you using your screenreader, how long have you been using it?
    
-   Have you had experience with filling out any online forms with the VA in the past?
    

-   **If yes:**
    

-   Can you tell me a little about the last time you filled out a form with the VA?
    
-   How was that experience?
    
-   Were you able to accomplish your goal?
    

-   **If no:**
    

-   Were there any specific barriers?
    
- #### Optional Question - If they have experience with VA copay or overpayment debt
Today I will be taking you through a form to help with VA debt. First, I’d like to briefly hear about your experiences with VA debt.

What has been your most recent experience with VA copay or overpayment debt? [establish baseline]
#### Task Overview

-  Imagine that you have a VA copay debt. Imagine you've been experiencing financial hardship and are having difficulty repaying the copay. Through some research, you find out that you can fill out the VA Financial Status Report Form to request help with this debt.
    
-   We will be asking you to fill out sections of this form where it will ask for things like your address and financial information.
    
-   If you do not feel comfortable sharing any personal information, you can enter fake information.
    

### Participant Tech Setup

Next, I want to get our tech set up.

- **We like to use transcription to improve our notes. However, this Zoom setting turns on Closed Captions in Zoom, which can be a problem for screenreaders. Would it be disruptive do have Closed Captions on?**

- If no, turn on transcription.
  

You will be interacting with a test account today. I will provide the login that you will need to enter.
    
- Now I'm going to have you share your screen so that we can go over it together.

#### Screenshare prompt

-   So we can understand how you’re navigating this form, we’d like you to share your screen. 
- *If participant cannot share their screen, walk them through screen sharing.*

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

-   Overall, how was your experience with the form?
    
-   For context: we are trying to improve the form navigation; if you had a magic wand and could change anything about this form- what would it be?
    
-   Were you ever confused about anything on the form?
    
-   **If No:**
    

-   What made you confident?
    

-   **If Yes:**
    

-   What would have helped make that more clear?

-   What was the easiest part about the form, if anything?

- In the next few questions, I'm going to ask you to rate different aspects of the form you filled out today.
- The first is efficiency and how efficiently you were able to fill out the form. Thinking about whether you were able to fill out the form at a speed you were comfortable with. On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not efficient at all, and 5 being very efficient, how efficient was your experience filling out this form? Why?
- The second is if the form got easier over time as you filled out more sections. On a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being not easy at all, and 5 being very easy, how easy was it to fill out the form the further you progressed? Why?
- The third and last, is whether the form was flexible and easy to navigate back and forwards, and recover from errors. On a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being not flexible at all, and 5 being very flexible, how flexible was this form? Why?
    
-   Do you have any questions for me?
