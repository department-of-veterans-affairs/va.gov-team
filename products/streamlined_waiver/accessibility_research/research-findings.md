## Research Goals
_First, set the context of this research by explaining how it fits into the Veteran’s journey. Explain what a Veteran might do before and after using this tool. What moments does this tool live in? Are there moments that matter to keep in mind? What are Veteran’s familiarity with tools like this? (do they use tools like this, or is this something new)._

_The Veteran Journey_

Debt can happen at any stage in [the Veteran’s journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) after the ‘Getting out’ stage. However, certain types of debt, such as Post-9/11 GI Bill debt, is more likely to occur at the ‘Finding something to do’ stage.

Other key moments this research touches in the Veteran journey are:

-   Attending to health needs
    
-   Taking care of myself
    
-   Managing my declining health
    

This research also touches on aging and managing new needs for those that develop vision issues or blindness later in life.

_Research Goals_


1.  #### Understand accessibility of the non visual user experience of the eFSR (Streamlined Waiver) forms and what improvements can be made (efficiency, auditory scannability, proficiency, flexibility)
    
2.  #### Understand how this form compares in contrast to mental models Veterans that use screen readers have with other forms
    
3.  #### Understand Veterans level of satisfaction with the eFSR (Streamlined Waiver) form



## Research Questions

### GOAL 1: Understand accessibility of the non visual user experience of the eFSR (Streamlined Waiver) forms and what improvements can be made (efficiency, auditory scannability, proficiency, flexibility)

### Navigation & Overall Experience

-   How do Veterans with visual limitations who use screen readers navigate through the form?
    
-   How easy or difficult is it to fill out the form with a screen reader?
    
-   Which area of the form would be most helpful for Veterans using screen readers to hear first when they tab?
    
-   Should it be: The header (step x of 7) or should it be the question they are being asked?
    
-   How do they experience error states?
    
-   Do participants know how to expand *additional information* sections? 
    
-   What is difficult to accomplish in this form, if anything?
    
-   How is the experience of signing the form?
    

### GOAL 2: Understand how this form compares in contrast to mental models Veterans that use screen readers have with other forms

### Comprehension

-   How is comprehension of the list loops from editing a section to the summary?
    
-   How clear is the transition from one section to the next of the form?
    


### GOAL 3: Understand Veterans level of satisfaction with the eFSR (Streamlined Waiver) form

### Satisfaction

-   How do Veterans that use screen readers feel about filling out the SW form? Does it meet their expectations? How can we improve their experience?
    

## Methodology 

-   Accessibility testing with a usability study approach



## Hypotheses and Conclusions

_Hypotheses or tasks for this research along with the conclusions you found If you conducted a usability test, list the success or task completion rate._

_[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#hypotheses-and-conclusions)_

_Hypothesis statement_

_("Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”) Why?_

1. We hypothesize that the eFSR/Streamlined Waiver form will be usable by Veterans that use screen readers. They will be able to understand it and fill it out.
**Maybe true**

2.  While we think it will be usable, we also believe that accessibility issues identified in an internal accessibility audit, may take away from the experience.
**Likely true**

3. We further hypothesize that the accessibility of the form will line up with the mental models that Veterans who use screen readers have about online forms.
**Likely true**


## Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._

_[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#key-findings)_

**Navigation findings**

**1. The ease of use of the financial status report form (streamlined waiver path) seemed to differ across participants based on the type of screen reader used and their level of proficiency with it, and unique navigation style.**

**2. The experience of navigating through the form if the participant was fully reliant on the screen reader (if blind) or if they were partially reliant on the screen reader (if low vision) presented different opportunities and challenges.**

**3.  We found that users of screen readers were extraordinarily patient.**


**UX/UI findings**

**4.   The login process was time-consuming and led to many participants running out of time to interact with the form.**

**5.   Two participants were confused by the cancel button on the Work History List Loop**

**6.   VoiceOver is not reading transition pages**

**Satisfaction Findings**

**7.The 2 participants that completed the form from start to finish felt that the form didn't flow as much as they would have wished, and wished for the convenience of hearing the entire form read to them at once. However,  they noted that the form got easier over time (p5 - JAWS user, 25 years; P6 - VoiceOver user,  2-5 years).**

**Navigation findings**

**1. The ease of use of the financial status report form (streamlined waiver path) seemed to differ across participants based on the type of screen reader used and their level of proficiency with it, and unique navigation style.**

Though we had a small sample, we do note that the 2 participants who struggled the most and were not successful signing in were using Dolphin Guide. Due to limitations of the Dolphin Guide technology, one participant was not able to activate the screen reader while in Zoom. This might be more indicative of a limitation of Dolphin Guide than of its success reading the FSR form. This should be noted for future AT studies that extra measures should be put in place for users of Dolphin Guide to successfully participate in AT interviews. 

The 2 participants who completed the form until the review page (P5) and the confirmation page (P6) were using JAWS and VoiceOver, respectively. P9 (using VoiceOver) might have been successful in signing in to the form if there had not been a staging error. He reviewed the Wizard and Introduction pages. P8 (using JAWS) was able to sign in and got to the contact info section before running out of time. 

We noted that in addition to JAWS and VoiceOver requiring different commands, they also read differently. 

Additionally, the sample of Veterans we spoke to sometimes had different systems they used to navigate through the form. For example, one participant (P8, JAWS) navigated the page by having the screen reader read all of the links on the page. This overemphasized the header and footer of the page rather than the content on the form pages. P5 (JAWS) had to alternate in and out of Forms mode. P6 (VoiceOver) has peripheral vision and would use a combination of screen reader and clicking. 

**2. The experience of navigating through the form if the participant was fully reliant on the screen reader (if blind) or if they were partially reliant on the screen reader (if low vision) presented different opportunities and challenges.**

2 participants reported being visually impaired but not blind. These participants used the screen reader some of the time and their vision the rest of the time to progress through the form. P6 has peripheral vision and uses their screen reader 20% of the time. One of the challenges that surfaced was that certain elements on the page were visually bothersome to participants with low vision. For example, P6 stated that the auto-save colored box was bothering them.

*How do you feel about the flash? It bothers me because it seems like I should be looking at it. If it flashes I should look at it. I don’t know what to do with it because it is flashing and not treating it like text. When it flashes you want to know what it is saying. I cant see what it says but I know it is flashing. (p6, VoiceOver)*

One of the opportunities was that, low-vision participants could use their vision to click in places where the screen reader was not reading the intended text. 

**3.  We found that users of screen readers were extraordinarily patient.**

Although the login process was time consuming and frustrating, participants were in good spirits and eager to continue to complete tasks until our 90 minutes ran out. Login took anywhere from ~ 15 minutes - 50 minutes. There is an opportunity to make the VA.gov sign in experience more accessible.

For this study, we used a staging test account. The form link had to be shared with participants to their email or to the Zoom chat. Participants had to manually retrieve the email and open the link, navigate back to the Zoom, and share their screen. They had to go through the Wizard, intro page, and then the login page. The user ID and password were shared with them verbally.

**UX/UI findings**

**4.  The login process was time consuming and led to many participants running out of time to interact with form.**

The 2 participants that were unsuccessful in signing in were using Dolphin Guide. The front end team is exploring options for creating an unauthenticated form for future usability studies.

**5.  Two participants were confused by the cancel button on the Work History List Loop**

One participant stated they thought the "cancel" button would cancel the whole form (P6, VoiceOver).

The same participant accidentally hit <back> and wasn’t sure where they were in the form.

*I started to understand the cancel and the back button if it jumped ahead. And if it jumped ahead, I wasn't sure if it jumped ahead or back, because I don't know where I am in the form, in my head, because I don't… when I jumped, had I jumped ahead or back? - P6
It was good that it didn't kick me out of the form entirely. But the use of the commands was a little confusing. Back or cancel. If it's cancel, I think I'm cancelling the entire form.  - P6*

**6.  VoiceOver is not reading transition pages**

This is an issue with Focus attribute and has been documented previously.

**Satisfaction Findings**

**7. The 2 participants that completed the form from start to finish felt that the form didn't flow as much as they would have wished, and wished for the convenience of hearing the entire form read to them at once. However,  they noted that the form got easier over time (p5 - JAWS user, 25 years; P6 - VoiceOver user,  2-5 years).**

P5 likened their preference to filling out a paper form by hand in one sitting, and P6 also expressed wanting the form to be read to them.

P5 felt the built in accessibility was good. P6 said it was "frustrating", however mentioned that they started to understand the <cancel> and <back> button.

*I personally would have all that information on one big form and just fill it out, like if I was writing it out by hand. Because the 'wizards' and all that stuff are extra steps that aren't necessary. You're going to enter the information one way or the other,  there are a couple of places in there where it was helpful and also some where it was confusing because you had to jump in and out of forms mode. If I could have got to this page and arrowed down and read the whole form at one time so I knew what was going to be asked of me, and go to forms mode until I hit submit, for me personally that would be easier.  - P5*

*I think you're doing a good job with your accessibility features. There were no areas where I didn't know what it was. There are a few places where it could be tweaked. For the most part it was very accessible. - P5*

*It was frustrating. Because the screen reader it was skipping over things and not reading them to me. And the continue and the back was frustrating. Because to me, I'm in the form and it looks like with that cancel it looks like it was a form within a form. Which is confusing because I'm in just one form. And then some of the text it didn't go to. It would start with the heading and jump to options instead of reading the title of the options for me. - P6*

*However it's formatted in the system, or if - I would have something where it was built into the form where it would read it to you, like my gmail reads me my emails, my adobe acrobat has its own reader, a lot of the news stations now have this thing where it reads it to you. I don't know if that's possible where it reads it to you.
Why do I need a whole screen reader? Why can't you just read it to me? - P6*


## Additional Insights

_Any additional insights that aren't "key findings." These can be powerful comments from users that don’t represent a pattern in this study, but may be part of one outside this study._

**-   Expandable help section was not reading for 1 participant on VoiceOver (P6)**

**-   The review page was confusing for P5 (JAWS)**

*There were drop down boxes there that would show what I already had entered. It was in a heading and a drop down box inside of a list. That is rather confusing. I didn't know if I could hit enter on that or not. So I would take those drop downs out of the heading. You're putting 2 forms at once in the same place and that confuses me at least. - P5*

**-   Signature field is not announced on JAWS (P5 didn't know he was signing a form)**

**-   On certain form questions, the VoiceOver was jumping to the question selections without reading the question first (P6)**

*Is there anything confusing on this page or something you are unsure of (Spouse’s Other Income page)? My screen reader jumps from the title to the selection. I can’t read the line above it. The other ones where the choices were yes or no it would eventually read the line above it. Okay there it goes I had to get the box up there to read it. - P6*

**Participant Baseline**

This sample of participants was varied in terms of the type of screen reader they were using (JAWS, VoiceOver, or Dolphin Guide) and their level of proficiency with screen readers. P5 completed the form up to the review page, p6 completed the entire form up to confirmation page, P8 got to the form until 'contact info' section, P9 only saw the Wizard and Intro page. P3 and P7 did not get past the sign in process (they were both using Dolphin Guide).

* 2 participants were using Dolphin Guide, 2 participants were using JAWS, 2 participants were using VoiceOver

* The 4 male participants have all been using screen readers for 10+ years, the 2 female participants have been using screen readers for 2-5 years. 4 participants reported being blind and 2 participants reported being visually impaired but not blind. 2 have had VA medical copay or overpayment debt in the past, and 4 have never had VA debt.

* P3 has been using Dolphin Guide and other types of screen readers since 2005-2006. Their method of navigation is through tabbing. P3 said they have a sighted helper that helps them fill out forms, and usually they need help filling out consent forms.

* P5 has been using JAWS and has been using screen readers for 25 years. They use their arrow keys to navigate through a form and the tab key to fill out a form.

* P6 has been using VoiceOver and stated they are more comfortable with VO on the phone than on Mac. They use VoiceOver only 20% of the time because they have peripheral vision. Stated VoiceOver differs between iPhone and Mac. They stated they use Adobe Acrobat to fill out forms (they like that they can download the form and it can read them the page).

* P7 was using Dolphin Guide on the phone, the only type of screen reader they have ever used. To navigate through a page:  "It comes up and the verbal part talks to me and tells me what it does and reads it off to me what is on the screen then I can speak back. That’s where I am having the issue. Its not getting my words back. Today I am having all kinds of trouble it seems."

* P8 has been using JAWS and stated they are 'fairly comfortable' using it and can do a variety of tasks with it (send emails, use excel spreadsheets). Said "I am not an expert but I can do it" and "learning to navigate is a continual learning process". Said they have a "system" to navigate pages and forms, they view heading lists and navigate by link. P8 had never visited the VA.gov website even though they go to the VA a lot.

* P9 has been using VoiceOver for 10 years and said they are "very comfortable" using it. Accomplishes tasks on desktop by keyboard and on the phone it's "swipe and touch gestures". The most recent form they filled out was for a VA Clinic which eventually they had to do over the phone because it wasn't completely accessible. Explains why:  "If it was yes or no it would read the question and it would say yes. It was a check box and the screen reader would say unchecked but there was no way to interact with the box to check it. Some sighted users could use the mouse to click and it would work but I couldn’t get it to work with my screen reader."
