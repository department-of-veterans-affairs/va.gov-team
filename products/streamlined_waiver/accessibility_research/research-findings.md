## Research Goals


_The Veteran Journey_

Debt can happen at any stage in [the Veteran’s journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) after the ‘Getting out’ stage. However, certain types of debt, such as Post-9/11 GI Bill debt, is more likely to occur at the ‘Finding something to do’ stage.

Other key moments this research touches in the Veteran journey are:

-   Attending to health needs
    
-   Taking care of myself
    
-   Managing my declining health
    

This research also touches on aging and managing new needs for those that develop vision issues or blindness later in life.

_Research Goals_


1.  #### Understand accessibility of the non visual user experience of the eFSR (Streamlined Waiver) forms and what improvements can be made (efficiency, auditory scannability, proficiency, flexibility)
    
2.  #### Understand how this form compares in contrast to mental models Veterans that use screen readers have with other forms
    
3.  #### Understand Veterans level of satisfaction with the eFSR (Streamlined Waiver) form



## Research Questions

### GOAL 1: Understand accessibility of the non visual user experience of the eFSR (Streamlined Waiver) forms and what improvements can be made (efficiency, auditory scannability, proficiency, flexibility)

### Navigation & Overall Experience

-   How do Veterans with visual limitations who use screen readers navigate through the form?
    
-   How easy or difficult is it to fill out the form with a screen reader?
    
-   Which area of the form would be most helpful for Veterans using screen readers to hear first when they tab?
    
-   Should it be: The header (step x of 7) or should it be the question they are being asked?
    
-   How do they experience error states?
    
-   Do participants know how to expand *additional information* sections? 
    
-   What is difficult to accomplish in this form, if anything?
    
-   How is the experience of signing the form?
    

### GOAL 2: Understand how this form compares in contrast to mental models Veterans that use screen readers have with other forms

### Comprehension

-   How is comprehension of the list loops from editing a section to the summary?
    
-   How clear is the transition from one section to the next of the form?
    


### GOAL 3: Understand Veterans level of satisfaction with the eFSR (Streamlined Waiver) form

### Satisfaction

-   How do Veterans that use screen readers feel about filling out the SW form? Does it meet their expectations? How can we improve their experience?
    

## Methodology 

-   Accessibility testing with a usability study approach



## Hypotheses and Conclusions

_Hypothesis statement_

_("Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”) Why?_

#### 1. We hypothesize that the eFSR/Streamlined Waiver form will be usable by Veterans that use screen readers. They will be able to understand it and fill it out.

**Maybe true**

The FSR experience through the screen reader was not cohesive across participants due to different screen reader types and unique navigating styles. More details in Finding #1. It would appear that across these different experiences, there are improvements that can be made to enhance the screen reader experience. 

#### 2. While we think it will be usable, we also believe that accessibility issues identified in an internal accessibility audit, may take away from the experience.

**Likely true**

A participant who identified as being a beginner VoiceOver user faced some of the issues seen in the internal audit. These include:
- Reading bullet points as "black square", which is a VoiceOver bug
- Not reading items that had issues with the Focus attribute including one of the Additional Information components and the Transition page. (See Finding #6)

#### 3. We further hypothesize that the accessibility of the form will line up with the mental models that Veterans who use screen readers have about online forms.
   
**Likely true**

This was true for the 2 participants that reached the end of the form. More details on Finding #7. 


## Key Findings

Navigation findings

**1. The ease of use of the financial status report form (streamlined waiver path) seemed to differ across participants based on the type of screen reader used and their level of proficiency with it, and unique navigation style.**

**2. The experience of navigating through the form if the participant was fully reliant on the screen reader (if blind) or if they were partially reliant on the screen reader (if low vision) presented different opportunities and challenges.**

**3.  We found that users of screen readers were extraordinarily patient.**


UX/UI findings

**4.   The login process was time-consuming and led to many participants running out of time to interact with the form.**

**5.   Two participants were confused by the cancel button on the Work History List Loop**

**6.   VoiceOver is not reading all information on the form pages, including the Transition page**

Satisfaction Findings

**7. The 2 participants that completed the form from start to finish felt that the form didn't flow as much as they would have wished, and wished for the convenience of hearing the entire form read to them at once. However,  they noted that the form got easier over time.**

#### Navigation findings

**1. The ease of use of the Financial Status Report form (Streamlined Waiver path) seemed to differ across participants based on the type of screen reader used and their level of proficiency with it, and unique navigation style.**

Though we had a small sample, we do note that the 2 participants who struggled the most and were not successful signing in were using Dolphin Guide. Due to limitations of the Dolphin Guide technology, one participant was not able to activate the screen reader while in Zoom. This might be more indicative of a limitation of Dolphin Guide than of its success reading the FSR form. This should be noted for future AT studies that extra measures should be put in place for users of Dolphin Guide to successfully participate in AT interviews. 

The 2 participants who completed the form until the review page (P5) and the confirmation page (P6) were using JAWS and VoiceOver, respectively. P11 (using VoiceOver) might have been successful in signing in to the form if there had not been a staging error. He reviewed the Wizard and Introduction pages. P8 (using JAWS) was able to sign in and got to the contact info section before running out of time. 

We noted that in addition to JAWS and VoiceOver requiring different commands, they also read differently. 

Additionally, the sample of Veterans we spoke to sometimes had different systems they used to navigate through the form. For example, one participant (P8, JAWS) navigated the page by having the screen reader read all of the links on the page. This overemphasized the header and footer of the page rather than the content on the form pages. P5 (JAWS) had to alternate in and out of Forms mode. P6 (VoiceOver) has peripheral vision and would use a combination of screen reader and clicking. 

>"The screen reader after I hit continue, it stays in form mode. I would like it to drop out so I use my arrow keys". "It's a screen reader preference thing." - P5 (JAWS, 25 years)
>"It seems to skip to different parts of the page on its own. Like it's not just reading straight down from the top to the bottom. When I navigate through the page because I'm an impatient person I use H for headings all the time. But I was just using my arrow key to go down the screen." - P5 (JAWS, 25 years)

>"I know this is the status report but I want to know about the links so I will do the search. A link list came up and there is a list associated with it. I go home and arrow down. Contact us is important because if you have a question or confused to can contact them. 6 of 63 links, there are a lot of links here. Homeless veteran, veteran women. I would like to know about that one (reads through all the links)" -P8 (JAWS, 18 years) 

**2. The experience of navigating through the form if the participant was fully reliant on the screen reader (if blind) or if they were partially reliant on the screen reader (if low vision) presented different opportunities and challenges.**

Two participants reported being visually impaired but not totally blind. These participants used the screen reader some of the time and their vision the rest of the time to progress through the form. P6 has peripheral vision and uses their screen reader 20% of the time. One of the challenges that surfaced was that certain elements on the page were visually bothersome to participants with low vision as they knew the elements were there but did not know what they said or what purpose they had. For example, P6 stated that the auto-save alert with a green background was distracting them.

>"How do you feel about the flash?" 
>"It bothers me because it seems like I should be looking at it. If it flashes I should look at it. I don’t know what to do with it because it is flashing and not treating it like text. When it flashes you want to know what it is saying. I cant see what it says but I know it is flashing." -P6 (VoiceOver)

Low-vision participants used their vision to click on places where the screen reader was not reading the intended text.

**3.  We found that users of screen readers were extraordinarily patient.**

Although the login process was time consuming and frustrating, participants were in good spirits and eager to continue to complete tasks until our 90 minutes ran out. Login took anywhere from 15 to 50 minutes. There is an opportunity to make the VA.gov sign in experience more accessible.

For this study, we used a staging test account. The form link had to be shared with participants to their email or to the Zoom chat. Participants had to manually retrieve the email and open the link, navigate back to the Zoom, and share their screen. They had to go through the Wizard, intro page, and then the login page. The user ID and password were shared with them verbally.

#### UX/UI findings

**4.  The login process was time consuming and led to many participants running out of time to interact with form.**

The 2 participants that were unsuccessful in signing in were using Dolphin Guide. The front end team is exploring options for creating an unauthenticated form for future usability studies.

>"When I do it on PC I don’t have many issues but I do have issues logging in with Va.gov. I have to do it once or twice to get signed in. It's been awhile since I have done it... What it's not giving me on the phone is the keyboard to sign in. That’s frustrating. That’s what I was saying about the accessibility for apps on the phone. I think my phone is fairly new and I keep it updated. I have this issue with other sites on the iPhone. I know with Uber its been an issue as well and a few others. I don’t know until I am on a website or an app." - P3

**5.  Two participants were confused by the cancel button on the Work History List Loop**

One participant stated they thought the "cancel" button would cancel the whole form (P6, VoiceOver).

The same participant accidentally hit "back" and wasn’t sure where they were in the form.

>"I started to understand the cancel and the back button if it jumped ahead. And if it jumped ahead, I wasn't sure if it jumped ahead or back, because I don't know where I am in the form, in my head, because I don't… when I jumped, had I jumped ahead or back?" - P6

>"It was good that it didn't kick me out of the form entirely. But the use of the commands was a little confusing. Back or cancel. If it's cancel, I think I'm cancelling the entire form."  - P6


*"Cancel" and "Add employment record" buttons on Work History page*

**6.  VoiceOver is not reading all information on the form pages, including the Transition page**

There is an issue with Focus attribute and has been documented previously that is causing the Transition page to be skipped by VoiceOver users. Other components where information was not being read by VoiceOver include the "Additional Information" accordion component as well as information near a question on a form page.


*Transition page*

<img src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/streamlined_waiver/accessibility_research/images/transition-page-fsr.png" alt="transition page" width="500"/>



#### Satisfaction Findings

**7. The 2 participants that completed the form from start to finish felt that the form didn't flow as much as they would have wished, and wished for the convenience of hearing the entire form read to them at once. However,  they noted that the form got easier over time (p5 - JAWS user, 25 years; P6 - VoiceOver user,  2-5 years).**

P5 likened their preference to filling out a paper form by hand in one sitting, and P6 also expressed wanting the form to be read to them.

P5 felt the built in accessibility was good. P6 said it was "frustrating", however mentioned that they started to understand the "cancel" and "back" button.

>"I personally would have all that information on one big form and just fill it out, like if I was writing it out by hand. Because the 'wizards' and all that stuff are extra steps that aren't necessary. You're going to enter the information one way or the other,  there are a couple of places in there where it was helpful and also some where it was confusing because you had to jump in and out of forms mode. If I could have got to this page and arrowed down and read the whole form at one time so I knew what was going to be asked of me, and go to forms mode until I hit submit, for me personally that would be easier." - P5

>"I think you're doing a good job with your accessibility features. There were no areas where I didn't know what it was. There are a few places where it could be tweaked. For the most part it was very accessible." - P5

>"It was frustrating. Because the screen reader it was skipping over things and not reading them to me. And the continue and the back was frustrating. Because to me, I'm in the form and it looks like with that cancel it looks like it was a form within a form. Which is confusing because I'm in just one form. And then some of the text it didn't go to. It would start with the heading and jump to options instead of reading the title of the options for me." - P6

>"However it's formatted in the system, or if – I would have something where it was built into the form where it would read it to you, like my gmail reads me my emails, my adobe acrobat has its own reader, a lot of the news stations now have this thing where it reads it to you. I don't know if that's possible where it reads it to you.
Why do I need a whole screen reader? Why can't you just read it to me?" - P6

>"Well I can only tell you as a JAWS user. I am finding that JAWS is telling me the headers, lists, buttons. It is giving me useful information as a JAWS user." - P8

## Additional Insights


**UX/UI**
-   The accordions on the Review page were confusing for P5 (JAWS).

>"There were drop down boxes there that would show what I already had entered. It was in a heading and a drop down box inside of a list. That is rather confusing. I didn't know if I could hit enter on that or not. So I would take those drop downs out of the heading. You're putting 2 forms at once in the same place and that confuses me at least. "
>-P5

-   On the Confirmation page, P5 didn't know he was signing a form as the signature field was not announced on JAWS.

-  Expandable ["Additional information" component](https://design.va.gov/components/additional-info) was not reading for one participant on VoiceOver (P6).

-  On certain form questions, VoiceOver was jumping to the question selections without reading the question first (P6).

 >  "Is there anything confusing on this page or something you are unsure of (Spouse’s Other Income page)? My screen reader jumps from the title to the selection. I can’t read the line above it. The other ones where the choices were yes or no it would eventually read the line above it. Okay there it goes I had to get the box up there to read it." - P6

- One participant's sentiment about the introductory page request to know about financial assets being "scary" echoed what others said in a previous study
>"it had a lot of threatening, scary concepts in there. You wanted to know about my assets and then later on it said they wont take a home or other things away from you. Then why would you ask, knowing it then of course you’d take them."
>-P6

- A few participants skipped past the introduction page where it lists all of the financial information they will need to share. This finding is consistent with previous studies done with Veterans that do not use screen readers.

>"I went straight to that link because this is what I want to do. I'm not a big person to read help screens." - P5

>"I hope there's nothing down below here because I'm not going to read it."
>"For people like me, you should put that link down below this. When I get to where I think I need to start I just go." - P5

**VA Experiences**
- After reading the Introduction/Steps page, one participant noted that the line on the page, *"If you need help with your request, contact a local Veterans Service Organization (VSO)"* was not helpful as it can take months to talk to a VSO. 

- One participant was very involved in a blind Veterans organization and stated that he did not know any other JAWS users. Other blind Veterans that he knew did not all use technology and did not have email addresses. 

- 2 participants said they do not have to pay for copays due to blindness being considered a catastrophic disability by VA.

- One participant mentioned the importance of VA.gov higlighting access to crisis support. This same participant talked about the importance of accessible technology and services. 
  
>"The fact that you are in crisis and need to talk I cannot say how often that needs to be repeated. Someone may have thought they heard it and if they go onto the next page and they hear it any may think they need help or just to remind you that you are able to talk to someone. It is very important... The worst thing is that they don’t press the button but if they do you might be saving someone’s life. I am finding it useful because again I never used this before." -P8

>The VA may provide tools but they aren’t going to pay for email and stuff. Then there are people that even if we don’t like it we have to meet them where there at. You have to me them where they are at if you want them to participate. Think of it like this if you’ve ever had an old radio where you had to dial into the station? Okay, back in the old days, we had this thing called a radio where you had to literally dial in to the station to find out where you are. People are the same, you have to dial into their frequency. You can’t assume they’re on the same frequency. You’re on FM and they’re on AM, you will never talk to them." - P8

## Recommendations

_Put together initial recommendations here based on your findings along with supporting evidence. Review with your team, then edit as needed._

* Ensure that users are able to Focus on all elements of the page. A VoiceOver user was unable to read the Transition page because it would not properly focus on certain elements of the page. 

* Update buttons to read "back" and "continue". Avoid using buttons that read "cancel" as screenreader users may believe it cancels out the entire form.



## Next Steps

_Next steps here. Include owners if appropriate._

Debt Resolution team is currently working on [implementation of recommendations](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsa---debt-607736a6c8b7e2001084e3ab/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/70022). 


## Further research needed

Only two participants were able to complete the form as other participants had technical difficulties or ran out of time.
We were not able to test the FSR form with anyone who uses Dolphin Guide as this software is focused on one task at a time. Participants were unable to successfully screen share while using Dolphin Guide. 
Only one participant who tested the full FSR form was a VoiceOver user and they were a beginner.

## Who we talked to 


**Participant Baseline**

This sample of participants was varied in terms of the type of screen reader they were using (JAWS, VoiceOver, or Dolphin Guide) and their level of proficiency with screen readers. P5 completed the form up to the review page, p6 completed the entire form up to confirmation page, P8 got to the form until 'contact info' section, P11 only saw the Wizard and Intro page. P3 and P7 did not get past the sign in process (they were both using Dolphin Guide).

* 2 participants were using Dolphin Guide, 2 participants were using JAWS, 2 participants were using VoiceOver

* The 4 male participants have all been using screen readers for 10+ years, the 2 female participants have been using screen readers for 2-5 years. 4 participants reported being blind and 2 participants reported being visually impaired but not totally blind. 2 have had VA medical copay or overpayment debt in the past, and 4 have never had VA debt.

* P3 has been using Dolphin Guide and other types of screen readers since 2005-2006. Their method of navigation is through tabbing. P3 said they have a sighted helper that helps them fill out forms, and usually they need help filling out consent forms.

* P5 has been using JAWS and has been using screen readers for 25 years. They use their arrow keys to navigate through a form and the tab key to fill out a form.

* P6 has been using VoiceOver and stated they are more comfortable with VoiceOver on the phone than on Mac. They use VoiceOver only 20% of the time because they have peripheral vision. Stated VoiceOver differs between iPhone and Mac. They stated they use Adobe Acrobat to fill out forms (they like that they can download the form and it can read them the page).

* P7 was using Dolphin Guide on the phone, the only type of screen reader they have ever used. To navigate through a page:  "It comes up and the verbal part talks to me and tells me what it does and reads it off to me what is on the screen then I can speak back. That’s where I am having the issue. Its not getting my words back. Today I am having all kinds of trouble it seems."

* P8 has been using JAWS and stated they are 'fairly comfortable' using it and can do a variety of tasks with it (send emails, use excel spreadsheets). Said "I am not an expert but I can do it" and "learning to navigate is a continual learning process". Said they have a "system" to navigate pages and forms, they view heading lists and navigate by link. P8 had never visited the VA.gov website even though they go to VA facilities a lot.

* P11 has been using VoiceOver for 10 years and said they are "very comfortable" using it. Accomplishes tasks on desktop by keyboard and on the phone it's "swipe and touch gestures". The most recent form they filled out was for a VA Clinic which eventually they had to do over the phone because it wasn't completely accessible. P11 explained:
> "If it was yes or no it would read the question and it would say yes. It was a check box and the screen reader would say unchecked but there was no way to interact with the box to check it. Some sighted users could use the mouse to click and it would work but I couldn’t get it to work with my screen reader."
