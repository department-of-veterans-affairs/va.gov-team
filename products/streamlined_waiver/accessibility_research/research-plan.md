# Research Plan for Debt Resolution Team, Streamlined Waiver (eFSR) Accessibility Study, October 2023

## Background

    

#### In this exploratory study, we seek to understand how Veterans that use screen readers navigate and fill out the enhanced Financial Status Report form (eFSR). We hope the results from the study will help inform accessibility best practices for our team going forward.

#### We believe it is important to help Veterans using screen readers maximize efficiency, build proficiency, enable auditory scannability, and allow a level of flexibility as they progress through the form.

Participants will log in to a test account on staging.

### OCTO Priorities

This research supports OCTO priorities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. This research especially supports number 4 for an experience that is usable by Veterans who use screen readers.

1.  Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
    
2.  Logged-in users can update their personal information easily and instantly
    
3.  Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
    
4.  Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
    
5.  Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov
    

### Veteran Journey

Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)? Are there moments that matter?

Debt can happen at any stage in [the Veteran’s journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) after the ‘Getting out’ stage. However, certain types of debt, such as Post-9/11 GI Bill debt, is more likely to occur at the ‘Finding something to do’ stage.

Other key moments this research touches in the Veteran journey are:

-   Attending to health needs
    
-   Taking care of myself
    
-   Managing my declining health
    

This research also touches on aging and managing new needs for those that develop vision issues or blindness later in life.

  

## Research Goals

What are you trying to learn from this research?

1.  #### Understand accessibility of the non visual user experience of the eFSR (Streamlined Waiver) forms and what improvements can be made (efficiency, auditory scannability, proficiency, flexibility)
    
2.  #### Understand how this form compares in contrast to mental models Veterans that use screen readers have with other forms
    
3.  #### Understand Veterans level of satisfaction with the eFSR (Streamlined Waiver) form
    

### Outcome

-   #### We believe the results from the study will help inform accessibility best practices for our team going forward.
    

### Research questions


### GOAL 1: Understand accessibility of the non visual user experience of the eFSR (Streamlined Waiver) forms and what improvements can be made (efficiency, auditory scannability, proficiency, flexibility)

### Navigation & Overall Experience

-   How do Veterans with visual limitations who use screen readers navigate through the form?
    
-   How easy or difficult is it to fill out the form with a screen reader?
    
-   Which area of the form would be most helpful for Veterans using screen readers to hear first when they tab?
    

-   Should it be: The header (step x of 7) or should it be the question they are being asked?
    

-   How do they experience error states?
    
-   Do participants know how to expand *additional information* sections? 
    
-   What is difficult to accomplish in this form, if anything?
    
-   How is the experience of signing the form?
    

### GOAL 2: Understand how this form compares in contrast to mental models Veterans that use screen readers have with other forms

### Comprehension

-   How is comprehension of the list loops from editing a section to the summary?
    
-   How clear is the transition from one section to the next of the form?
    


### GOAL 3: Understand Veterans level of satisfaction with the eFSR (Streamlined Waiver) form

### Satisfaction

-   How do Veterans that use screen readers feel about filling out the SW form? Does it meet their expectations? How can we improve their experience?
    


### Hypothesis


1. We hypothesize that the eFSR/Streamlined Waiver form will be usable by Veterans that use screen readers. They will be able to understand it and fill it out.

2. While we think it will be usable, we also believe that accessibility issues identified in an internal accessibility audit, may take away from the experience.

3. We further hypothesize that the accessibility of the form will line up with the mental models that Veterans who use screen readers have about online forms.

## Timeline

Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.

Tuesday Oct 24, 2023 - Friday, November 3, 2023

### Prepare

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.

-   Pilot participant email: Angela Fowler
    
-   Date and time of pilot session: Tuesday, Oct 6, 2023
    

### Research sessions

-   Planned dates of research: Tuesday Oct 24, 2023 - Friday, November 3, 2023
    

### Length of sessions

-   Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours):
    

-   90 minutes
    

-   Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time)
    

-   60 minutes buffer
    

-   Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)
    

-   2 per day
    

### Availability

When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.

Please request enough dates and at least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; 12 time slots for 6 participants). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.

Tuesday Oct 24, 2023 - Friday, November 3, 2023

9am PT - 2pm PT: Tuesday, Wednesday

10am PT - 2pm PT: Monday, Thursday, Friday
