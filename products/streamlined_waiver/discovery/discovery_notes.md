*8/4/2022 - Team Project Kickoff* 
- Reviewed Income Verification Calculator and VHA Decision tree logic files with Jill Anderson (DMC)

*8/10/2022 - Technical Discovery*
- Purpose: sourcing GMT data from HUD website with Joshua Faulkner
- Outcome: 
    - Scott/Denise will reach out to Jonathan Carver to recieve annual SDS updates
    - Joshua sharing sample file from most recent annual update
    - Denise will follow up with business side on 10% addition to GMT. Current assumption is this can be added it's just part of the calculator. If we're already doing references like "Their Discretionary Income is below 1.25% of the GMT Threshold" then we're already having to use percentages on that value. 
    - Denise will follow up with business side regarding need for Veteran income verification checks.
