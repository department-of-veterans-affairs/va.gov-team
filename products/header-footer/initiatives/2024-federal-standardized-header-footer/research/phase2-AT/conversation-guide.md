## Intro - 5 minutes 
Thank you for joining us today! My name is Cindy. How are you doing today?

I work on making technology easier for Veterans to use in order to get information and benefits from the VA. 

What I *hope to do today* is to get your feedback on something new that we're working on. 

What *I don't want to do* is add to any frustration you may have had with getting benefits from the VA. We may talk about things that have caused you frustration, and I want you to know up front that I cannot make that better for you right now. I do not have access to your records, nor do I have any contact with claims reviewers. But I'd like to understand your frustrations because they can help me advocate for improvements to the process in the future.

I have a colleague with us in this session who will be taking notes. *[Laura/CAIA person]* is also in this meeting to help with any technical issues that may arise with your use of assistive technology during this session. 

There are a few of my teammates who would like to observe this session as well. **Would it be OK with you if I invited them to join us?**
- *(If participant seems hesitant or unsure or uncomfortable)* Just so you know, my teammates will be muted and off camera and you won't have to interact with them. You also have the option to keep the session just the two of us plus the notetaker.
- *(If yes, let them in--3-4 MAX. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")*

- *(NOTETAKER & OBSERVERS JOIN w/cameras ON )* We have a few people from the team listening in today: there's [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, etc. *(If I don't know the name of one of the observers, ask them to please turn on their camera and say their name aloud)*

Could the observers please turn their cameras off now to save bandwidth? *(and leave their real names instead of "Observer")*

Today I'm going to ask you a few questions, and then I'll ask you to do some specific tasks using a website that I will share with you.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This session may take an hour and a half.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or task.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We're testing a website to learn how we can make it easier to use. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

- We like to record to confirm that we’ve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at the VA to show user feedback. If we do this, we don’t link anything you choose to share in the session to any information that identifies you, and we remove your face and name from any videos that we share.
**Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - *(If yes:)* Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

*Select Record, then Record to the cloud.*

*(If participant asks you to NOT record)* Are you comfortable if I save the transcript of the session? *(If not, take good notes!)*

*In the bottom toolbar of the Zoom window, click the arrow next to **SHOW CAPTIONS** > **View Full Transcript** > Save. (NEED TO DO THIS TO GET TRANSCRIPT)*

~~Click Live Transcript and **Enable**, or **Show Captions**~~
~~*Click **Live Transcript > View Full Transcript***~~

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: 
  - Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 
  - Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners, as long as we remove any information that could be used to identify you?

*After checking that transcription is working, close the Transcript panel by clicking **Close Full Transcript** in the Show Captions menu.*

## Screen sharing instructions (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your computer, there's a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a button that says Share *(on phone, may need to scroll sideways or click **More...**)* or Share Screen *(on computer, button is green).*
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)

- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the button that says **Share**. Then there will be options for what to share. Please choose **"Screen"** (phone) or your web browser.
- Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

- iPad: **Broadcast screen**

- ~~*Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*~~
  - ~~Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control--doesn't work w/iPhones]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?~~

## Instructions for finding Zoom chat
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, there's a row of buttons at the bottom. 
  - Computer: Just to the left of center is a conversation bubble that says Chat. 
    - *If don't see chat, ASK:* Do you see the (red) "Stop Share" button? If so, put your mouse just above it and there should be more Zoom controls. Then click on the Chat button in the center of the Zoom controls.
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.

## Protocol for Recognizing & Handling Trauma-Triggering
*Remember*: Getting to all the questions on your script isn’t as important as the Veteran feeling heard. Prioritize the participant over the research.
### OBSERVE the participant
*Be PRESENT with the participant. Notice their body language, tone of voice, and the environment* 

*SENSE discomfort, anxiety, nervousness, anger, teary/crying, shakiness, nervousness. Some signs may include:*
- *Prolonged silences*
- *Shifts in tone or attitude or interactivity*
- *New background noises*
- *Staring into space* 

### If notice a change, SAY one of these:
  - Sometimes talking about these types of experiences can be difficult. Do you think you would be comfortable telling me if it starts to affect you negatively?
  - This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?
  - Would you like me to stop recording?
  - I sense that this may be upsetting. We value what you’re sharing with us, but we don’t have to go there if you don't want to.
  - Do you want to just sit here quietly for a few minutes?
  - Would you like to pause, or are you OK with continuing?
  - Is this not a good time for this session?

### If resume after a break
I'm interested to hear more about...Are you up for continuing with that, or would you prefer to move on to the next topic?

### Handling other specific situations
- *If p isn't feeling well in the moment*
  - I'm sorry to hear that you're (not feeling well--repeat their words). Do you feel up for continuing? You will be compensated even if we stop early. 
    - *(If they want to keep going)* Please let me know if you change your mind.
- *If p describes something that seems unfair*
  - I hear you saying that this is unfair. It sounds incredibly frustrating. I'm sorry to hear that you've been going through this.
- *If MST (military sexual trauma) comes up*
  - I am so sorry that happened to you. I hear you, and I'm grateful you felt safe sharing this with me.

### If you notice something and want to make sure they know how to get mental health help
I want to remind you that VA can help connect you to mental health services--even if you're not enrolled in VA health care. To access services right away, call or go to any VA medical center at any time 24/7 or any Vet Center during clinic hours. You can also call 877-222-8387, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET. That's 877-222-8387.

### If the participant is fine to continue, but you're worried about their situation...
I realize I'm worried for you being in this situation. I don't have concrete help I can offer, but I do have a hotline number. Before we continue, would you like me to give you the number?
- If you need to talk to someone right away, you can contact the Veterans Crisis Line via phone, text, or chat anytime day or night. You can call 988 or text 838255. It's confidential and available 24 by 7.
- You could also call the Benefits Hotline at 800-827-1000.

### If I feel teary or emotional
*Turn off my camera and/or say,* I need to step away for a moment.

### When participant is fine to continue, but you're not sure you can
I hear that you're good to continue. Before we do, I realize that I need a minute--I'm going to go off video, mute myself, and get a glass of water. Is that OK with you? I'll be back in X minutes.

*(If I'm still not OK to continue)* After taking a breather, I realize I'm not able to continue. You didn't do anything wrong, and you will get paid for the full time. I appreciate your time and your willingness to share your experience.

### When a participant decides to stop the session
I don't know if you'd want to call, but the Veterans Crisis Line number is 988. It's confidential and available 24 by 7.

Thank you for your time in having this call. I honor your decision to stop and wish you well. *[Try to maintain a CALM tone]*

## User Tasks
Now I'm going to ask you to do some things... 

### Screen sharing
*(If **Dolphin** screen reader, won't be able to share screen on Zoom, so will need to open the prototype and listen to them and their screen reader while they navigate. Ask them to talk aloud about what's going on.)*

*(If we can't hear the screen reader)* Since I can't hear your screen reader and don't want to interrupt it, after I ask you to do something, I'll try to not say anything until you say that you're done or need help, OK?

I would like you to share your screen with me so that I can see what you do during this session. Before we start, I want to make sure you know that screen share will show me your own screen, so if you'd like to close any apps or turn off notifications that you don't want me to see, you could do that now.

- *(refer to Screen sharing instructions above, if needed)*
- *STOP TECH TROUBLESHOOTING **< 20 min into session** if want a replacement participant from Perigean b/c not likely to be successful*

We can help guide you through this if you need help. Please say what you're doing out loud so that if there are any issues, we'll know what they are.

1. Make sure that the Zoom application has focus

1. Navigate to the screen share button

1. Check the "share sound" checkbox (so we can hear their screen reader speaking)--may have to tab a LOT to get to this in the right pane

- *(If asked, reassure that this is a legitimate link to what I want you to test)*
- *(Might need to hold tablet horizontally so easier to read)*

Did you get the link? 

- *If “unsupported browser” error, ask to try a different browser or device, or share my screen (works for anyone) and mouse control (doesn't work w/iPhones)*
- *If prototype doesn't open, copy the URL and open in a new incognito window (Chrome), private window (Firefox, Safari) or InPrivate (Edge)*


### Task 2: [First impressions]
