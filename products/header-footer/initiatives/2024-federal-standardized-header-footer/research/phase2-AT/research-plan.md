# Research Plan for Usability Testing, Federal Standardized Header/Footer--Phase 2 (Assistive Tech users), January 2024

## Background
OFCIO and GSA (USWDS) designed a new federal standardized header and footer in an effort to standardize across all federal agencies. This new header and footer includes a new “USA” logomark that has yet to be released to the American public. A federal standardized header and footer directly contributes to the requirements of the [21st Century IDEA](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/M-23-22-Delivering-a-Digital-First-Public-Experience.pdf). The Department of Veterans Affairs has volunteered to be the first high-impact service provider (HISP) to attempt to adopt this new header and integrate into the department’s design system. 

Initial research will test with Veterans and beneficiaries to validate that it can be successfully adopted with minimal to no negative impact to site visitors.

### OCTO Priorities 

This research aligns with the following [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md)

- Solidify the VA.gov platform 
- Refresh VA.gov homepage and IA 

### OFCIO Priorities 

This research aligns with the [21st Century IDEA](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/M-23-22-Delivering-a-Digital-First-Public-Experience.pdf).
- Create a consistent user experience across government websites by creating a standardized header/footer that contributes back to the USWDS

### Veteran Journey
There are many potential touchpoints between the Veteran and this application throughout the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):
- Getting out
- Starting up 
- Taking care of myself 
- Retiring 
- Aging

## Research Goals	
The purpose of this research is to find out: 

- Wayfinding task success rate throughout header and footer menus
- How Veterans using screen reader or screen magnifier technology navigate the proposed header and footer IA  
- Veteran sentiment on USA logo and VA seal, with the dropping of the “VA” brand mark   


### Outcome
The findings from this research will create an understanding of how the header and footer design impacts the Veteran wayfinding experience.  

### Research questions
1. Are Veterans (and others) able to navigate the newly organized footer with new column headings, link names, and separate VA and Federal footer sections? 
    - What tasks, if any, do participants struggle navigating to?  
1. How does the new font family and increased font size impact readability?  
1. Do Veterans (and others) using screen readers or other assistive technology have a positive experience with information wayfinding and task completion?  
1. What do Veterans (and others) think of the integration of both the authenticated menu and main menu on mobile into one menu? 
    - Do they provide a better, positive experience or create confusion? (i.e., how to sign in, sign out, locate  auth menu items) 
1. What are Veterans’ (and others’) task success rates?  
1. What are Veterans’ (and others’) first impressions of the new header and footer? 
    - How do Veterans (and others) feel about the way VA is represented in the header without the letters “VA”?  
    - How do Veterans (and others) feel about the new USA logo? 
     

### Hypotheses
1. Veterans (and others) will be able to easily use the header and footer. 
1. Veterans (and others) won’t have any difficulty reading any of the text shown in the prototypes. 
1. Veterans (and others) who use assistive technology (screen reader or screen magnification software) will be able to easily use the header and footer. 
1. The new VA seal helps Veterans (and others) understand this is a VA website. 
1. Veterans (and others) will be able to easily find the authenticated menu when it’s integrated with the main menu in the mobile header. 
1. The new USA logo mark helps Veterans (and others) understand this is a Federal government website. 

## Method	
We will conduct **remote moderated usability testing** to observe research participants using mobile and desktop prototypes.   

Sessions will be conducted over Zoom with transcripts. 

We would like to test with both mobile and desktop users. 

There will be 2 phases of research: 

- **Phase 1: Non-assistive technology users**  
  - Both desktop and mobile users 
  - 2 Figma prototypes (mobile and desktop) 
  - 60-minute sessions 
  - [research folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/header-footer/initiatives/2024-federal-standardized-header-footer/research/phase1-no-AT)


- **Phase 2: Assistive technology users** 
  - Both desktop and mobile users 
  - 1 coded prototype that's accessible and responsive (CodePen) 
  - 90-minute sessions 
  - [research folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/header-footer/initiatives/2024-federal-standardized-header-footer/research/phase2-AT)

NOTE: We will consult with AuthExp team to have them lead usability testing for authenticated menu as a Phase 3.
