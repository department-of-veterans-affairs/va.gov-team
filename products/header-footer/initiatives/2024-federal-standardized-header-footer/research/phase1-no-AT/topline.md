This topline summary is a preliminary summary of research findings observed in the research sessions. The purpose is to share what was learned in the sessions before the holiday break and transition to planning Phase 2 of the research with assistive technology users.

## Introduction
The purpose of this research was to get user feedback on **wayfinding using the new Federal header and footer, as well as Veteran sentiment on the new USA logo branding**. 

## Participants
On December 15-21, 2023, we talked over Zoom with **10 people**--9 Veterans, 2 Caregivers, 2 family members, and 1 Service member (some people had multiple roles).
- Half (5 of 10) saw the **mobile** version of the prototype from a smartphone.
- Half (5 of 10) saw the **desktop** version of the prototype from a tablet or computer.
- Most (7 of 10) participants had **extensive experience using *VA.gov*** and/or the VA mobile app. Only one participant (a caregiver and spouse of a Veteran) had never used them before, and 2 other participants had used them only once or twice.  

## Preliminary Findings
### Usability Successes
1. **None of the 10 participants mentioned missing the "VA" logo**, so it seems to be fine to not have that on the page.
1. **Successful wayfinding to tasks seemed not adversely affected by the new header and footer**. 4 of 10 participants breezed through all the tasks, though others were challenged by some tasks, especially when too focused on only the header and missed links in the footer, or too focused on only the footer and missed links in the header. Tasks that were most challenging were FOIA and VA jobs (for participants not looking in the footer), VA location (for participants not looking in the header), and changing address (for participants who had difficulty finding the Auth menu).
1. None of the 10 participants commented on font size, but both pilot participants (who were Veterans) said unprompted that they **liked the font size**. 
   >*"I didn't have to get out my reading glasses to read anything, so that was a big plus for me" (pilot 1).* 
4. One participant noticed the different fonts between the header/footer and the page content. They **preferred the font in the header bar** and the *U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs* because of its sharp/clean edges (*vs.* the blurry/rounded letters in the life insurance content). Note that the blurry text may have been from screenshot images of existing content, which won't be used in Phase 2 of the research when the page content will be coded.


### Authentication task
5. Before signing in, 3 of 10 participants navigated to *VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu > Records > Change your address* (this link didn't work in the prototype) to learn how to change your mailing address.
1. After signing in using the prototype, **3 of 10 participants (2 on phone, 1 on desktop) didn't recognize that they were actually signed in** because the user interface didn't change much. The subtle change of "Sign in" to "Sign out" (mobile) or "Cameron" (desktop) wasn't enough for everyone to notice.
1. After signing in, ***2 of 5 phone users* had difficulty finding the Auth menu** (under "Cameron" in the mobile header menu); the other 3 found it easily.  
1. After signing in, ***2 of 5 desktop users* had difficulty finding the Auth menu** (by clicking on "Cameron"); the other 3 found it easily. Results might have been different if the menu had shown the participant's real name. Interesting that the same number of desktop and mobile users had difficulty.
1. After signing in and opening the Auth menu, **all participants readily clicked on the Profile menu**. However, 2 participants then wondered aloud if they should try *My VA* instead (which didn't work in the prototype).

### Footer
10. **Four of 5 participants on phones had difficulty understanding the differences between the accordions in the mobile footer** *(Information for, More resources, Connect with us, and Contact us)*. One person said that "Connect with us" and "Contact us" seemed too similar and thus confusing. During the sessions, all four opened up one accordion after the other, scanning for relevant links and not understanding what might be in each from its name. Perhaps the accordion names could be made more meaningful and distinctive.
1. **Four of 10 participants described the difference between the footer links with a blue *vs.* black background** as VA/you *vs.* legal/federal. The other participants didn't articulate a difference between the two sections.

### How recognize as an official government website
12. Most (7 of 10) participants said that they would **look at the URL to see if it's *.gov* or *VA.gov*** because the words and graphics could be spoofed. 
1. Participants also mentioned other features of the page:
     - **VA seal** (7)
     - "An official website of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs" in the footer (5)
     - "U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs" in the header (4)
     - "USA Government" in header (3)
     - Logo, typeface, and accordions of other VA pages (3) 
     - "USA" logo in footer (1)
     - "Veterans Crisis Line" (1)

### USA Logos 
14. **Six of 10 participants thought the colored USA logo in the header was unnecessary and maybe harmful** with varying degrees of sentiment: 
    - not telling you anything new (3 participants) 
    - **might be phishing** (2)
    - fake and cheesy (1)
    - taking up real estate on the page (1) 

     > *"Just cause it says USA Government don't mean nothing" (p11).*

     > *" I don't think the U.S.A. Government at the top is necessary...Why somebody would want it, I guess, to give them the warm and fuzzies that it's a government website...you gotta watch out for scamming scam websites and phishing and all that other stuff. Just putting U.S.A. Government at the top does not make it official to me" (p3).*

       > *"It's aesthetically pleasing, but it's not necessary. It could have been in all white on a black background" (p10).*
    
     > *"Amateurish to me, so I would immediately if I saw it on a .gov website think that I'm being phished" (p8).*

     > *"Am I getting spoofed right now, and I'm going to put in my information and have my identity stolen?" (p7).*

     > *"It looked weird there to me. Thought it was fake like it was just added on...It is redundant to me because it's the **US** Department of Veterans Affairs...We all know that we serve, so we know that it's part of the government...I just don't understand the importance of it being there" (p4).*

     > *"Just unnecessary real estate being used there at that point. So unless I'm able to click on it and go to another government resource, I don't really see a need for it...doesn't necessarily seem to blend in with the page. It's just like something added up top there (p8).* 


1. Only **one person loved the colored USA logo**, and this was a Veteran who had previously worked professionally on branding and logos. He had very specific reasons for liking it so much. One other person thought it looked nice but didn't need color.

   > *"It's interesting...The S is...a different..logo/type from the U and the A...It draws your eye to it because of the improbability of the mixed logos. It creates an improbability that creates curiosity, which increases time looking...When it's colored, it kind of dances...due to that odd S in the middle. It's sort of the perception...that it's moving...the S in the middle is wiggly. And the red...ordinarily would be red, white, blue, but it's blue, red, white. That's another improbable thing...Whoever's involved with that, tell them I said that they were smarty pants, and I like it...It's very well done. It's very well considered, and it's awesome. I've done a lot of this work in the past." (p2).*

   > *"It's aesthetically pleasing, but it's not necessary. It could have been in all white on a black background" (p10).*

18. **Two participants liked the black/white USA logo in the footer better than the colored one** in the header because it stands out, looks good, and seems more official. 
    > *"This bottom one seems a little bit more official to me...states an official website...more boring and professional" (p8).*

    > *"It's not some...scam website that at the top it looks cheesy to me...Looks very nice...at the bottom it's like a seal of approval, this is an official website...it just looks very good...it's simple. I like that. It's colorless. It has the eagle" (p4).*


## Next Steps
- Plan and conduct Phase 2 of research
- Do more data synthesis
- Write full research report for Phase 1 and 2
