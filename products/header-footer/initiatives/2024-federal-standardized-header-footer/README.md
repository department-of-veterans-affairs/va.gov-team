# Federal standardized header and footer

* Epic: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/14078
* [Decision log](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/header-footer/initiatives/2024-federal-standardized-header-footer/decision-log.md) 

#### Overview

This initiative will work to solve three problems:
1. Increase performance - The performance of the header should be reviewed and optimized as much as possible to better support Veterans and beneficiaries accessing VA.gov on low-bandwidth connected devices or those who are concerned about data plans. (Equity)
2. Use web components - The VA.gov header needs to be migrated to use web components in order to allow the update of the VA.gov Design System to USWDS 3.0. 
3. Prototype OFCIO's new global header and footer layout - attempt to adopt OFCIO's new experimental global header and footer and test with Veterans and beneficiaries to validate that it can be successfully adopted with no (minimal?) negative impact to site visitors.

## Outcome Summary
- Performance/data requirements of header is reduced
- Usability of the main navigation is maintained or improved, especially on mobile devices.
- Usability flow into authenticated experience(s) is maintained or improved, especially on mobile devices.
- Usability of the VCL is maintained or improved, especially on desktop devices.
- Larger font sizes help Veterans understand and interact with VA.gov
- Usability of the header and page is unaffected by font-family change
- Usability of the authenticated experience is unaffected (may be out-of-scope?)

OFCIOâ€™s goals with this work:
- Veterans have provided positive feedback about the USA brand mark.
- Veterans have provided positive feedback about the use of the VA seal.

## Problem
* How might we better support Veterans and beneficiaries on low-bandwidth devices?
* How might we modernize the header to 'unblock' the work on the VA.gov Design System move to USWDS 3.0
* How might OFCIO unify a Federal brand
* How might VA.gov migrate intent, design, and needs into the guardrails provided by this revised design with guardrails.


## Desired User Outcomes
* Faster page load time/interaction with page elements
* Increased trust in website

## Undesired User Outcomes
* Frustration/confusion

## Desired Business Outcomes
* Use of web components to better align with VA.gov Design System
* Fewer breaks of the injected header experience
* Ability to unify a Federal brand

OFCIOâ€™s goals with this work:
- Global header and footer, and global menus and navigation, code can be copy/pasted and used on other federal .gov websites
- USWDS team can copy/paste the code and design parameters, and refactor as necessary, to codify these updates in the design system


## Undesired Business Outcomes
* Decreased user satisfaction

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

* Performance of header on various page types:
  * VA.gov homepage
  * VA.gov health hub page
  * Injected performance on legacy teamsite page (e.g. https://www.va.gov/health/)
  * 10-10EZ form?
* Overall satisfaction score
* VA.gov experience rating

| Product KPI | Baseline as of **DATE** | Target | Link to data source (e.g. GA, Domo) |
| ----------- |  ----------- |  ----------- |  ----------- | 
| VA.gov homepage performance |   |   |   | 
| VA.gov health hub page performance |   |   |   | 
| Legacy Teamsite page performance |   |   |   | 
| Online form performance |   |   |   | 
| VA.gov Overall Satisfaction |   |   |   | 
| VA.gov Experience rating |   |   |   |

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks. Inspired by [SVPG's Four Big Risks](https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/).*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - .
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - .
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Examples:
    - Upstream/Downstream API/Data availability and reliability
    - Site performance impacts (see [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/), #-daily-lighthouse-scan)
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Examples: 
    - VA stakeholder testing, marketing, compliance requirements
