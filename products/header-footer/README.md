# Global header and footer

---

## Overview
The VA.gov header and footer are key navigational elements for VA.gov. They go beyond just a feature of the modernized VA.gov as the header and footer are also 'injected' to many non-modernized sites via script. Examples include: 
- https://www.cem.va.gov/ 
- https://benefits.va.gov/benefits/ 
- https://www.va.gov/health/

Note: Be aware that there are also "copycat" injected headers such as https://www.research.va.gov/ (as of 4/17/2023) that exist because the injection script cannot work on that site.

## Problem Statement

- How might we create and maintain a header that supports Veterans "browse" behaviors on the site that accurately reflect flows and information architecture?
- How might this header support the identity of VA?
- How might we create and maintain a header that increases the usage and throughput of VA services - especially that of self-service?
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- As a site visitor, I want to know that I am on a Federal website so that I have confidence in any information I learn from the site or provide to applications on the site.
- As a site visitor, I want to know that the content I am viewing is part of the official Veterans Affairs website so that I have confidence in the information I learn from the site or provide to applications on the site.
- As a site visitor, I want an intuitive menu so that I can easily navigate the site via my preferred "browse" site behavior.
- As a site visitor using a mobile device, I want an intuitive experience so that I can easily interact with the site without a header getting in the way of the content.
- As a site visitor, I expect content and actions in a header and footer to be consistent with best-in-class commercial websites to meet my expectations of interacting with VA.gov.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- High cognitive load
- Long page load times


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Facilitates the IA of VA.gov
- Easily maintained content that leverages the CMS and content publishing releases rather than code releases for most maintenance activities.
- Contains mandated information (e.g. FOIA, Privacy, No FEAR, etc) and supports Federal and VA policy (e.g. 21st century idea act, etc)
- Supports VA.gov design system needs
- Supports USWDS design system needs

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- Long turn-around times for content updates
- Link farm/dumping ground
- Creates site bloat that slows down the loading of the site

#### Product Ownership

The VA Design System Team will take ownership of the Header (including meganav) & Footer in July 2024, upon completion of Sitewide work to segregate the injected header code ([Slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C03LFSPGV16/p1719954937244809?thread_ts=1719849942.025859&cid=C03LFSPGV16))

The Sitewide team owns the design of the header while the Design System Team owns the code of the header going forward. Thus the Design System Team is currently building out the web-components and will be working with other teams to support web-components in TeamSites.
