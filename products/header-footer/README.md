# Global header and footer

---

## Overview
The VA.gov header and footer are key navigational elements for VA.gov. They go beyond just a feature of the modernized VA.gov as the header and footer are also 'injected' to many non-modernized sites via script. Examples include: 
- https://www.cem.va.gov/ 
- https://benefits.va.gov/benefits/ 
- https://www.va.gov/health/

Note: Be aware that there are also "copycat" injected headers such as https://www.research.va.gov/ (as of 4/17/2023) that exist because the injection script cannot work on that site.

## Problem Statement

- How might we create and maintain a header that supports Veterans "browse" behaviors on the site that accurately reflect flows and information architecture?
- How might this header support the identity of VA?
- How might we create and maintain a header that increases the usage and throughput of VA services - especially that of self-service?
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- As a site visitor, I want to know that I am on a Federal website so that I have confidence in any information I learn from the site or provide to applications on the site.
- As a site visitor, I want to know that the content I am viewing is part of the official Veterans Affairs website so that I have confidence in the information I learn from the site or provide to applications on the site.
- As a site visitor, I want an intuitive menu so that I can easily navigate the site via my preferred "browse" site behavior.
- As a site visitor using a mobile device, I want an intuitive experience so that I can easily interact with the site without a header getting in the way of the content.
- As a site visitor, I expect content and actions in a header and footer to be consistent with best-in-class commercial websites to meet my expectations of interacting with VA.gov.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- High cognitive load
- Long page load times


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Facilitates the IA of VA.gov
- Easily maintained content that leverages the CMS and content publishing releases rather than code releases for most maintenance activities.
- Contains mandated information (e.g. FOIA, Privacy, No FEAR, etc) and supports Federal and VA policy (e.g. 21st century idea act, etc)
- Supports VA.gov design system needs
- Supports USWDS design system needs

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- Long turn-around times for content updates
- Link farm/dumping ground
- Creates site bloat that slows down the loading of the site

## Solution Narrative

### Current Status

#### 2024-03-01
- Cindy finished drafting the [header/footer research report](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/header-footer/initiatives/2024-federal-standardized-header-footer/research/research-findings-phases1%262.md) and shared with @aklausmeier for feedback.

#### 2024-02-29
- Cindy's goal is to have the synthesis and reporting completed before the end of Sprint 105, and will then start the research readout and post-research tasks.

#### 2024-02-16
- Project placed on paus because the OFCIO wants to conduct a broadened research endeavor that will encompass more than just VA.gov
- Randi to finish working on the flattened injected header/footer; Design team to continue their work on the auth portion; will release only the injected header changes when the Design team is finished.
- Cindy to continue work on the synthesis and reporting.

#### 2024-02-05
- Jill/Fran/Randi met with Amanda to chat about the slight changes to the auth menu
- Wes's team to work on the user's displayed name only
- Randi is slogging through the injected header with help from Micah on the auth portion

#### 2024-01-22
- Decision [log](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/header-footer/initiatives/2024-federal-standardized-header-footer/decision-log.md) created regarding creating a flattened HTML for the injected header/footer.

#### 2024-1-10
- Randi created tickets for preliminary (head-start) build-out of the header and footer. The header story will be pulled into Sprint 102

#### 2024-01-08
- Header build out [Ticket ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/16815)was able to be pulled into Sprint 101; it will most likely roll over to Sprint 102
- Footer build out [ticket ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/16809)created, refined, and poised to be pulled into Sprint 102, if possible.
- Mega menu clean-up [ticket ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/16816)created and will be reviewed with Dave to get approval for style/markup cleanup.
- CodePen completion is on track
- Research tasks are on track

#### Status week of 01/02/2024
- The [Federal Header/Footer research topline summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/header-footer/federal-standardized-header-footer/research/phase1-no-AT/topline.md) has been revised by Cindy Merrill and is now ready for Dave / Amanda to share more widely.
- Cindy will be working on these two tickets during Sprint 101, which begins on 01/03
  - Draft Federal Header Footer Phase 2 research plan #[16611](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/16611)
  - Draft Federal Header Footer Phase 2 conversation guide #[16613](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/16613)
- Randi Mays and/or Chris Kim will be working on these two tickets during Sprint 101:
  - [Review Codepen for Federal Header #16571](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/16571)
  - and then: [#16573 Build Codepen Header/Footer Prototype screens](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/16573)

#### Status week of 12/27
- Cindy (on 12/22) met with Amanda K and wrote a [research summary report]( https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/header-footer/federal-standardized-header-footer/research/phase1-no-AT/topline.md.) that's somewhere between a topline and a full report
- Cindy will transition to planning Phase 2 of the research (in January
- Laura delivered the CodePen work she's done so far to Chris/Randi for review. Ticket to finish builing out the prototype is [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/16573)

#### Status week of 12/4/2023
* Cindy submitted her research plan and convo guide to Shane on 12/6
* Research dates identified: Dec 15-22 (10 completed sessions with a 25% overage like Perigean requests).
