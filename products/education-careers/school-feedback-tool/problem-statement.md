# Problem Statement
###### The GI Bill Complaint Tool is currently housed on a DoD website where Veterans can register a complaint regarding the use of their GI Bill. The current server is being retired and the tool is moving from DoD to VA on the Vets.gov platform. As part of this transition, we want to design a better experience for Veterans interacting with the tool.
