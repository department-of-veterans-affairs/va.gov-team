# Research Plan for [Team], GI Bill Complaint Tool, [date] 

## Goals
### 1. What product & team are you doing this research for?
This is the GI Bill Complaint Tool on behalf of the DSVA.  We are doing this research for the minimum viable product tool.  This version of the tool (prototype found here https://www.figma.com/file/FHoTbqOpW2ymjj3xo1V1gU0C/GI-Bill-Complaint-Tool-Userflow)
### 2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 
See <a href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/GI%20Bill%20Complaint%20Tool/Discovery%20Phase/Product%20Outline.md">Product Outline</a> for information.
### 3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 
1. Where can language/content be improved to simplify the process?
2. Does the user have a good sense of the process and what content will be shared vs. kept private?
3. Is the user comfortable with the tool and using this to help them if there are future issues? 
### 4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 
* Users will be more comfortable with the simplier version of the tool .
* The user will be able to answer how long before the VA follows up.
* The user will have an easier time navigating to the complaint tool. 
## Method
### 1. What method of research are you planning? 
  * Directed interviews (remote moderated)
  * High-fidelity prototypes via the figma mock up (remote moderated)
  * Card Sort (in-person / remote moderated)
  
### 2. Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 
Directed interviews allow us to gather first-hand research information from the user. Using a high-fidelity prototype (or in our case, the figma mock up) allows the users to work with something "tangible". We want to be able to see how users interact with the tool. 

### 3. Where are you planning to do your research?
Go To Meeting 
### 4. What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 
The current (pre-existing) GI Complaint Tool on DoD website
