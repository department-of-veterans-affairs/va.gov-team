<h1>Screening</h1>

Simple sign-up response

Hi [VETERAN NAME], thank you so much for expressing interest in the GI Bill Complaint Tool feedback session! I'd like to hop on the phone to ask you some basic questions, so we can learn more about you and make sure the feedback session is a good fit. It should just take 5 - 10 minutes. Is it alright for me to give you a call? Do you have a preferred time?

Thank you again!

Mariam

Script for the screening call

Hello,

Thank you so much for your interest in joining us for the GI Bill Complaint Tool feedback session! I don't know how much you already know about this project, but I'm part of a VA team working on Vets.gov a site that helps Veterans discover, apply, track and manage their benefits and we want to talk to Veterans as we create online tools so we can make sure we're getting it right. 

The sessions themselves usually last about 45 min to an hour, and we'll ask you to take a look at some online tools and provide feedback. Today, I just want to ask you some background questions to make sure it's a good fit for the Gi Bill Complaint tool sessions.  It should take about 5 - 10 min.

Does this sound good so far?
