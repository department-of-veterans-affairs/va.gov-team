## Intro (5 Minutes)
* Thanks for joining us today! My name is Mariam and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. We work with the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs on a website called Vets.gov, and we’re excited to talk with you today to get your feedback on the website.

* Before we start, a few things to mention:

* This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally move us along to the next topic.

* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the application to better meet Veteran’s needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

* You’ll be interacting with the current GI Bill Complaint Tool, but we will not be submitting any data from today's session.

* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

* Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start recording.*
