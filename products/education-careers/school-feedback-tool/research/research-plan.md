# Research Plan for [Team], GI Bill Complaint Tool, [date] 

## Goals
### 1. What product & team are you doing this research for?
This is the GI Bill Complaint Tool on behalf of the DSVA
### 2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 
See <a href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/education-careers/school-feedback-tool/product-outline.md">Product Outline</a> for information.
### 3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 
1. What information does the user want to include in their complaint?
2. What is the best question order for the user?
3. What makes a user more likely to use the tool through completion
### 4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 
* Users will be more likely to use the tool if the design is captivating.
* Better data will be acquired if the tool asks more specific questions.
## Method
### 1. What method of research are you planning? 
  * Directed interviews (remote moderated)
  * High-fidelity prototypes via the pre-existing tool (remote moderated)
  * Card Sort (in-person / remote moderated)
  
### 2. Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 
Directed interviews allow us to gather first-hand research information from the user. Using a high-fidelity prototype (or in our case, the pre-existing tool) allows the users to work with something "tangible". We want to be able to see how users interact with the pre-existing tool before creating an entirely new tool. Doing so allows us to see which areas of the tool need improvement and which areas are working well. A Card Sort will help us idenfity an optimal question order by way of the users themselves. 

### 3. Where are you planning to do your research?
Go To Meeting 
### 4. What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 
The current (pre-existing) GI Complaint Tool on DoD website
