Hello!  

My name is Mariam and my team at the Department of Veterans Affairs is currently working on a project to improve the GI Bill Complaint tool (https://afvec.langley.af.mil/pecs/VAPECS.aspx).  Our team is looking for Veterans or anyone currently attending university under the GI Bill (such as a Veteranâ€™s spouse or dependent) to participate in a feedback session about the current tool and how we might improve it.  Sessions usually last about 45 minutes and can be done in person (DC area) or online.  Please email natalie.moore@va.gov for more information and to setup a time to chat. 

Thanks!
