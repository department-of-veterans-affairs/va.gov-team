<h1> Observations </h1> 

## From Screening Calls...
+ Jeffery 
  + Felt like the VA didn't actually listen to his complaint because it was marked as resolved before he had a chance to even check his email 
     + he was frustrated with the entire process because he didn't know what to expect from the response team or how long to wait 
  + Also the form often timed out on him while he was trying to write his response and it was really frustrating for him too
  + He had a hard time condensing and writing out what happened
     + he said he was essentially a whistle blower for his school 
     + he claims has been grossly exploiting GI Bill Funds 
     + he was really upset that the entire thing got flagged and disregarded before he was able to talk to an actual person from the response/complaint processing team


## Possiable Improvememts 
+ Write out what "Next Steps" a person can take 
+ Give an anticipated timeling for processing and response 
+ Remind them to check email/mail in X number of days 
+ make sure the next form doesn't time out frequently/quickly
