## Intro (5 Minutes)
* Thanks for joining us! I'm Mariam, I spoke to you earilier, and I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. We work with the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs on a website called Vets.gov, and are so excited to talk with you today get your feedback on the website.

* Before we start, here are some quick reminders:

* This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I respect your time and don't want to keep you much longer than that, so I may occasionally move us along to the next topic.

* We want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the application to better meet Veteran’s needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express.  I invite you to think outloud and share any and all feedback.

* You’ll be interacting with the new prototype GI Bill School Feedback Tool so we will not be submitting any data from today's session.

* Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start recording.*
