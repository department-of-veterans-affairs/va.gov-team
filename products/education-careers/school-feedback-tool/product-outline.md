# Product Outline
## Problem Statement
###### The GI Bill Complaint Tool is currently housed on a DoD website where Veterans can register a complaint regarding the use of their GI Bill. The current server is being retired and the tool is moving from DoD to VA on the Vets.gov platform. As part of this transition, we want to design a better experience for Veterans interacting with the tool.


## Solution Goals
###### Our goal is to implement the GI Bill Complaint Tool on Vets.gov in an efficient, effective and visually appealing manner.

## Business Requirements
###### Veterans must be able to express varying types of complaints through an online form. 

## Research Insights
###### Display text here.

## Solution Approach
###### We plan on building a digital form with React.js on the frontend and a backend connection with Salesforce. This will enable users to quickly submit their complaints about their GI Bill on Vets.gov. Weâ€™re shooting to launch a first version (MVP) of this form on August 1st, 2018.

## Key Performance Indicators
###### * Decrease the time it takes for a user to submit a complaint
