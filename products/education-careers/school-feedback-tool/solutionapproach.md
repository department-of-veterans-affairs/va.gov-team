We plan on building a digital form with React.js on the frontend and a backend submission connection to the Central Mail API. 
This will enable users to quickly submit the 686 form with supporting documentation on Vets.gov. 
Weâ€™re shooting to launch a first version (MVP) of this form on June 1st, 2018.
