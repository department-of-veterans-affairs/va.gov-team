# Project Title: GI Bill Complaint Tool

The GI Bill Complaint Tool is currently housed on a DoD website where Veterans can register a complaint regarding the use of their GI Bill.  The current server is being retired and the tool is moving from DoD to VA.  The server is being retired and the front end needs to move to the Vets.gov platform.  As part of this transition we need to design a better experience for Veterans interacting with the tool.
