**VET TEC**

Veteran Employment Through Technology Education Courses (VET TEC) is a 5-year pilot program that matches Veterans with high-tech training providers. Veterans can start or advance their career in the high-tech industry with a training program that’ll take months—or just weeks—to complete. The pilot program started in 2019 and runs through March 31, 2024.

_HOUSING ALLOWANCE CONTENT REQUIRES APPROVAL FROM EDU / DEPO_  

**Your housing allowance is determined by where you take classes**  

Under the GI Bill you’re eligible to receive a monthly housing allowance. We calculate this monthly housing allowance based on where you take classes.  

If you use Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to take at least 1 in-person class, your housing allowance is based on where you do most of your coursework. If you take online courses only, your housing allowance is based on 50% of the national average.  

Through Dec. 21, 2020, current and new students can receive in-person allowance rates if their school’s approved program changed from in-person to online learning due to COVID-19.

**Cautionary warnings and school closings**

VA applies caution flags when we, or another federal agency, have increased regulatory or legal scrutiny of an educational program. We recommend students consider these warnings before enrolling in flagged programs.

When VA receives notice that a school or campus location will be closing, we add a school closing flag to that profile. Once the closing date passes, we remove the institution from the Comparison Tool during the next system update.
