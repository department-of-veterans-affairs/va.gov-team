# Product Outline: Comparison Tool Filter Enhancements 
---

## Overview
*After you've explored the problem and through testing / hypothesis have identified the ideal solution, write up one sentence describing the solution you'll be creating.*

## Problem Statement
The GI Bill Beneficiaries using the Comparison Tool are lacking additional nuanced data points that would help them find schools and training institutions that are a best fit for their education needs and make better education decisions. 

How might we include additional information within the Comparison Tool regarding unique institution attributes in order to provide more holistic information to GI Bill Beneficiaries that can inform their decisions about how to use their benefits?

## Desired User Outcomes
*Why would a user want to use this?*
*With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
- Identify school that best meets criteria quickly
- Quick and seamless process of filtering and locating needed information
- Users can sort and filter using a more robust set of criteria than is currently available; i.e., in-state/out-of-state, non-traditional semesters, etc. 

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Users are overwhelmed with the options in the search interface and don't use them. 
- Users have to go to multiple sites to get the information they need (VBA standpoint)
- User unable to quickly find applicable school

## Desired Business Outcomes
*Why would your business want this to exist?*
*With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
- Increase the number of Comparison Tool users (VBA standpoint) (this should be considered in KPI exercise)
- People are better able to find what they are looking for on the site (this should be considered in KPI exercise)

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Recreate the college scorecard

## Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### KPIs
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
- KPI: increase # of GIBCT users
- KPI: positive feedback from users

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

### OKRs
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

---

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumtion w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

## KPIs
- *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
--- 

## Go-to-market Strategy
- *How are Veterans and others using this product going to know it exists?*
- *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful?*

## Target Launch Date
- *What is your target launch date of your MVP/iteration?*
- *What is your date for when you'll evaluate impact after launch?*

## Solution Narrative
### MVP (These are MVP requests and serve as a wish list until research on each is complete)
The existing integration with College Scorecard already pulls in a subset of the College Scorecard data, so this would just be additional data points. We are planning for display and search:
- Display Data Elements on Search Results
- Allow for Data Elements to be filter-able
- Link to College Scorecard Profile (Include URL of college scorecard page as a Scorecard data elements)
   - The URL is one of the data elements (like a citation; it adds validity to the data)
- Display Data Elements on Profile Page
- Data Elements (The existing integration already pulls in a subset of the College Scorecard data, so this would just be additional data points. We are planning for display and search.):
   - Data Element: HBCU
   - Data Element: Men Only
   - Data Element: Women Only
   - Data Element: Religious Affiliation

### Nice to have/Enhancements
- Data Elements (The existing integration already pulls in a subset of the College Scorecard data, so this would just be additional data points. We are planning for display and search.):
   - Data Element: HCM2 (heightened cash monitoring, severe)
   - Data Element: Distance Only
   - Data Element: PCTFLOAN (Percent of Full-time, Firsttime Undergraduates Receiving Federal Loans)
- Filter Criteria: Program Level (i.e., Graduate vs. Undergraduate)
- Filter Criteria: In-State vs. Out-of-State (Location)

### Current Status

### Key Decisions

### Supporting Artifacts
- Attributes to consider displaying/incorporating into search in the Comparison Tool: https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/assets/FullDataDocumentation.pdf
