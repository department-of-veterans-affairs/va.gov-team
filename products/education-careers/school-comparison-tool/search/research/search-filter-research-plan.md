# Research Plan for Search/Filter
As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	(This should be filled out and maintained by the designer on the team & can be cross-linked and referenced in any issues.) 	
## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	
- Booz Allen research for Education Services / OIT
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

GI Bill beneficiaries using the Comparison Tool experience challenges as they search for institutions and lack nuanced data points that could help them find and filter schools and training institutions that are the best fit for their education needs.  The current search in the Comparison Tool requires users to enter an exact match in order to provide them with results.  If users search for content in the Comparison Tool and use an abbreviation or nickname, or if they misspell an institution, then the results they are searching for will not be returned.  Additionally, users are not able to easily identify and filter institutions by certain attributes (i.e. gender-exclusive, religious affiliations).  

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	

Search:
- Does the new search improve the experience of finding a school in the CT? 
- Does the search field update make it easier for users to find schools of interest in the GIBCT? 
- What are users expectations of what they should enter into the search text field to get the results they seek? 
- What types of location-based searching does the user perform (e.g. name of city, ZIP code)?
- How does the new search functionality impact type-ahead? 
    - Do users expect type-ahead to work for acronyms or nicknames?
    - Do users expect to see results if they misspell a name?

Filters:
- How do users naturally engage with the filters?
    - Are users interested in using the filters?  Which ones?
    - Do users know how to use filters (implement, change, clear)?
    - Are the users confused by any of the filters?
    - Do users open collapsed sections/additional info components?
    - Are there any other filters users would like to see?
- What are the users' thoughts and expectations on the filter tags?
   - What do users think of filter tags?
   - Do users find the tags on the school cards useful?
   - Do users expect the tags to be interactive/informative?
   - How important are tags to the user?
   - Do users expect all filters to have tags, some of them or none?  If some, which ones?
- What do users think of the search results after searching and filtering?


4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	

The new search and filtering capabilities will be more effective for users - giving them a better search success rate and enabling them to narrow down results more easily. 
## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  - Remote moderated usability testing in both production and staging environments
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	

Researchers need to see the search habits of users and their interaction with the filters.  We also need to be able to ask users what their expectations are for search and filtering - and how those expectations align with what they see on the screen.  We need to identify any pain points or UI elements that cause confusion or detract from the user's goals.

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? 
  Online

4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 
  Search, page, content

5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	
  Zoom

## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
- August 12-13, 2020 	
2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? 
- 30 minutes
4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.).
