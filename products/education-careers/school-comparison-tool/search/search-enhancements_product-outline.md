# Product Outline: Comparison Tool Search Enhancements 
---

## Overview
*After you've explored the problem and through testing / hypothesis have identified the ideal solution, write up one sentence describing the solution you'll be creating.*

## Problem Statement

The current search in the Comparison Tool poses challenges for users as they search for institutions since it requires that they enter an exact match in order to provide them with results.

      - If users search for content in the Comparison Tool right now and accidentally include a mispelling or an abbreviations or nicknames (such as UCLA or Cal State, state abbreviations) then the results they are searching for will not be returned.
      - The current search feature limits the ability to search on school type to just on the job training (OJT) and schools, which means people are not able to search exclusively for programs of specific length (like associates programs), VET TEC programs, and more.


How might we make it easier for people using the Comparison Tool to quickly find the content they are looking for using well known institution abbreviations, nicknames, portions of institution names, or partial matches?

## Desired User Outcomes
- Users find the school they are looking for the first time/Users spend less time searching for what they need
- It is easier for users to find what they are looking for if searching for an institution that isn't an exact match for their search criteria
- Users can successfully search for schools in the CT using the nomenclature that makes sense to them
- Users can use different types of content to search for their institutions (partial matches, institution type, location, etc)

- *Why would a user want to use this?*
- *With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Users get search results that are not relevant to their search
- Users are less satisfied with the new search than they were with the previous version of the search. 

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Improve Comparison Tool user satisfaction by making it easier for people to find what they are looking for in the tool
- Better understand the criteria that is important to Veterans when selecting an institution/program to apply GI Bill benefits to

- *Why would your business want this to exist?*
- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Users report a lower satisfaction rate with the new search

## Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### KPIs
- User time spent searching 
  - Maybe by tracking how many times people go back and forth between search results/profile page; time spent on page
- Decrease the amount of times 0 results are returned (this was feedback collected during PI planning and has since been determined not to be an issue). 
- The confidence level of beneficiaries utilizing the CT to search for benefit information about institutions/programs/etc has increased


* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

### OKRs
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

---

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumtion w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

## KPIs
- *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
--- 

## Go-to-market Strategy
- *How are Veterans and others using this product going to know it exists?*
- *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful?*

## Target Launch Date
- *What is your target launch date of your MVP/iteration?*
- *What is your date for when you'll evaluate impact after launch?*

---

## Solution Narrative
### MVP (These are MVP requests and serve as a wish list until research on each is complete)
- Search Criteria: Program Level (i.e., Graduate vs. Undergraduate)
- Search Criteria: Zip Code
- Search Criteria: In-State vs. Out-of-State (Location)
- Search Criteria: Alternate/Nicknames/ Abbreviations
   - WEAMS has a slot for nicknames that isn't currently being used in WEAMS (used to be... we can look at reusing this field)

### Nice to have/Enhancements
- Expose CT Search as an API
- Facility Locator Integration: https://www.va.gov/find-locations/
- Map-Based Search
- Luke T: On search, long term goal, can we include something like, if for example I searched for UCLA can we include other schools that people look at if they look at UCLA
