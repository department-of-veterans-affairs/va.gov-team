### About ratings 

We ask Veterans who have used their education benefits to rate schools they’ve attended on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, with 5 stars being the best rating. 

#### How ratings are collected

VA works independently to collect ratings from Veterans. We reach out to Veterans to provide a rating who have:
- Received a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) for benefits
- Transferred into or out of a school 
- Made a change to their program of study, **or**
- Completed their degree program 

Veterans rate schools on a number of categories. Those ratings are averaged to calculate the overall school rating. If a Veteran doesn’t rate a category, it has no effect on the category’s overall score. 

#### Veteran privacy

A school may ask us for a list of Veterans who rated their school, but we do not share individual ratings with schools. If an institution asks us for information on who rated their school, no information beyond what is publicly available on the Comparison Tool is shared with them that would tie an individual to their ratings.
