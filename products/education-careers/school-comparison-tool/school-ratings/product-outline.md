# Product Outline: School Ratings
---

## Overview
*After you've explored the problem and through testing / hypothesis have identified the ideal solution, write up one sentence describing the solution you'll be creating.*

## Problem Statement
When Veterans and other GI Bill beneficiaries are looking for schools within the Comparison tool, they want to know about the experiences of other Veterans and GI Bill beneficiaries to form a better understanding of what their personal experience at the school would be like. Ratings enable Veterans to quickly assess the suitability of a school (both pro and con), bolstering their confidence and level of comfort in deciding if a particular school is right for them.

How might we bolster GI Bill beneficiaries' confidence and level of comfort when picking schools using the Comparison Tool? Ratings enable them to quickly ascertain the experiences of other Veterans at a particular school and assess the overall suitability of that school for them.


## Desired User Outcomes
*Why would a user want to use this?*
- Incorporating a Rating System into the Comparison Tool would potentially provide information to prospective Veteran students that doesn't exist anywhere else - a rating of the experience from this specific consumer group of Veterans and their beneficiaries utilizing their GI Bill Benefits to attend institutions for higher education. There is a high level of importance to Veterans in gaining and understanding of the prescense of the Veteran community at the institutions they are considering attending. 
- Individuals who use the Comparison Tool want to know about the experience other Veterans and their beneficiaries regarding Veteran support when they are making a decision about what institution to attend to utilize their GI Bill Benefits. To quickly and easily see and hear the voice of their peers, which is highly valued within the community. 
- This has potential to increase in the confidence level of GI Bill beneficiaries when making a decision to attend an institution
- This would give GI Bill beneficiaries the ability to provide and review both positive and negative feedback

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Questions that are asked of Veterans to rate the institution do not reflect highest areas of interest to Veterans
- Individuals who do not have verified experience with institutions providing ratings of the institutions
- Individuals who do not have verified experience as a GI Bill Beneficiary providing ratings of the institution
- Ratings do not assess the institution at large, and instead reflect a personal conflict,subjective/inaccurate information
- Unbalanced ratings, for example too few ratings to be of value. 
- Discrepancies between the ratings in the Comparison Tool and other comparable sites

## Desired Business Outcomes
*Why would your business want this to exist?* 
- Features within the Comparison Tool align to those that are most valuable to the users
- Consolidating the resources that Veterans need to utilize to make a decision about how to utilize their GI Bill benefits
- Veteran impression that they are able to make better use of GI Bill Education benefits
- Increased usage of the Comparison Tool because it is more useful to Veterans
- Positive feedback from Comparison Tool users
- A decrease in complaints from schools
- Ability to utilize reviews to identify issues beneficiaries experience at GI Bill approved schools in order to launch investigations or compliance reviews
- Fewer payment errors (assuming poorly rated schools are schools that tend to have payment errors and therefore have fewer GI bill participants)
- Improved school performance in servicing Veterans/beneficiaries
- Reduction in utilization of poorly rated institutions
- A reduction in benefit utilization at poorly rated institutions

- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
   - Enhance the Comparison Tool by providing insight into the Veteran-specific experience

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- High level of effort related to maintaining and moderating ratings
- Managing comment resolution and follow-up
- Increased complaints on the part of institutions based on rating content
- Leverage the feedback system as part of this or not creating a separate experience; Important to differentiate the rating and feedback systems; we don’t want user confusion between the feedback tool and the rating system, (i.e., users don’t know where to put their feedback or comments.)

## MVP
### MVP
- Display rating within the comparison tool
- 5 star rating 
- Policy around how to handle content
- Ratings by Authenticated/Verified user only
- Specifically asking Veterans for data through the email blasts, collect that data; leverage GIDS or API to populate the data on the Comparison Tool
   - EDU: Want BAH to provide a recommendation regarding how best to get this information and share it.
- No specific time period for which we are allowing people to submit reviews (no limit on when benefits were exhausted)


### Nice to have/Enhancements
- Short Rater Narrative
- Moderate Short Rater Narrative Content
   - Need a policy, process, and people to manage this.
   - Issue resolution and negative review custom notifications.
- Medallia integration
- Is there a way to incorporate feedback tool findings in the Comparison Tool?
    - This comes up whenever the complaint breakdown portion of the page is tested in usability testing sessions
   
### TBD - Need to determine if these are MVP or nice to have
- Reporting
- Ratings by authenticated/verified users only
   - Can an authenticated user rate a school they are NOT attending?
- Possible ratings:
   - Overall institution rating
   - Quality of classes/education
   - Veteran friendliness
   - Employment preparation
   - Recruiting/marketing practices

## Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### KPIs
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
- Number of ratings
- Users view ratings by clicking jumplink from top of profile page
- Users scroll to / past About ratings content

Longer term KPI (can begin tracking after a viable number of ratings have been collected across schools)
- VA benefits to lower rated schools decrease

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

### OKRs
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumtion w/your initial set of functionality*
- Legal and policy approval will be acquired before this feature is launched on Production. There will be engagement from these organizations throughout the design and development process leading up to launch. 

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
   - 5-star rating system that can be utilized by Veterans and their beneficiaries who can verify their engagement with the institution they are rating. Include ratings of things like: 
      - Overall Institution Rating
      - Quality of Classes / Education
      - Veteran Friendliness
      - Employment Preparation 
      - Recruiting/Marketing Practices
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
   - This solution does not require a large amount of overhead for moderation or require as much legal or policy scrutiny because it does not include narrative reviews.
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
   - Narrative Reviews
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*
   - Potentially investigating how to allow for more narative reviews

## KPIs
- *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*

## Go-to-market Strategy
- *How are Veterans and others using this product going to know it exists?*
- *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful?*

## Target Launch Date
- *What is your target launch date of your MVP/iteration?*
- *What is your date for when you'll evaluate impact after launch?*

### Launch Considerations
- Legal or policy approval must be aligned before launch
