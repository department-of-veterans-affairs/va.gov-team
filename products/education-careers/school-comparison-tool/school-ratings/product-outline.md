# Product Outline: School Ratings
---

## Overview
*After you've explored the problem and through testing / hypothesis have identified the ideal solution, write up one sentence describing the solution you'll be creating.*

## Problem Statement
When GI Bill beneficiaries are looking for schools within the Comparison tool, they want to know about the experiences of other Veterans to form a better understanding of what their personal experience at the school would be like. Ratings enable Veterans to quickly assess the suitability of a school, bolstering their confidence and level of comfort in deciding if a particular school is right for them.

*How might we* bolster GI Bill beneficiaries' confidence and level of comfort when picking schools using the Comparison Tool?  Ratings enable them to quickly ascertain the experiences of other Veterans at a particular school and assess the overall suitability of that school for them.

## Desired User Outcomes

- *Why would a user want to use this?*
   - Individuals who use the Comparison Tool want to know about the experience other Veterans and their beneficiaries have had (i.e., whether or not the school provides great Veteran support) when they are trying to make a decision about what institution to attend to utilize their GI Bill Benefits. 
- *With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
   - Incorporating a Rating System into the Comparison Tool would potentially provide information to perspetive Veteran students that doesn't exist anywhere else - a rating of the experience from this specific consumer group of Veterans and their beneficiaries utilizing their GI Bill Benefits to attend institutions for higher education. 

## Undesired User Outcomes
- High level of effort related to maintaining and moderating reviews
- Reviews that do not assess the institution at large, and instead reflect a personal conflict
- Increased complaints on the part of institutions based on review content
- Legal scrutiny around development of narrative rating system
- Individuals who do not have verified experience with institutions providing reviews of the institutions

## Desired Business Outcomes

- *Why would your business want this to exist?* 
   - Enhance the information available in the Comparison Tool by providing insight into the Veteran-specific experience
- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

## Assumptions

   - 5-star rating system that can be utilized by Veterans and their beneficiaries who can verify their engagement with the institution they are reviewing. 
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
   - This solution does not require a large amount of overhead for moderation or require as much legal or policy scrutiny because it does not include narrative reviews.
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
   - Narrative Reviews
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*
   - Potentially investigating how to allow for more narative reviews

## KPIs
