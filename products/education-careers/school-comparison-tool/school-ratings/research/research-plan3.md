# Research Plan for School Ratings
As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	 	
## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	
- Booz Allen research for Education Services / OIT
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

When Veterans are looking for schools within the Comparison tool, they want to know about the experiences of other Veterans to form a better understanding of what their personal experience at the school would be like. Ratings enable Veterans to quickly assess the suitability of a school (both pro and con), bolstering their confidence and level of comfort in deciding if a particular school is right for them.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	

- What are users’ overall impressions of ratings?
   - What do users think of the ratings?
   - Do users think the ratings are useful?
   - Are there any aspects of the ratings design that users find confusing?
   - What’s users’ impression of how scores are calculated?
   - Do users think the “Not yet rated” scores affect the overall score?

- Do users understand the UI & supporting content?
   - Do users understand the “Not yet rated” indicators?
   - What do users believe “True to expectations” means?
   - What do users think of the “About Ratings” content?

- How do users (want to) engage with ratings?
   - Are users interested in filtering search results by star ratings?
   - Are users interested in sorting search results by star ratings? 
   - Do users engage with the ratings category accordions? 

- How do ratings’ impact decision making?
   - How does the overall rating weigh into the user’s perception of the school?
   - How do the individual ratings weigh into the user’s perception of the school?

- What are users’ impressions of the new school card layout?



4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 

We believe that Veterans will understand the rating categories and find the ratings useful, especially in determining the Veteran experience at a particular school.

## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  - Remote moderated usability testing	
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	

Researchers need to be able to see how users react and interact with school ratings.  We need to be able to ask about their impressions and expectations of those ratings to determine if the current design is meeting their needs.  We also need to identify any points of confusion and whether this feature will be valuable to Veterans.

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? 

 - Online using Zoom
 
4.	What will you be testing? 
 - Page and content
 
5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	
 - Zoom
