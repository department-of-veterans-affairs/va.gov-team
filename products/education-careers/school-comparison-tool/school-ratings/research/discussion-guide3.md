# School Ratings Discussion Guide


*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Amy and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we would be looking at the Comparison Tool and talking about ratings and what information is helpful for Veterans when determining if a particular school is a good fit for them.  
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?" 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
 - Are you currently using or have you ever used your education benefits?
   - If yes, which benefit are you using?  
       - When did you start school?  Where did you go?
  - If no, do you plan on using your benefits in the near future?  
       - Which benefit?  
       - Where are you in the school selection process?
       
 - What was most important to you when you were looking for potential schools?
       
 - Have you ever used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before? 
    - If yes, what did you use it for?
    
**As a disclaimer, we will be looking at ratings data for several schools.  This data is fabricated and does not represent the actual thoughts or experiences of Veterans. **

## First Task: Feedback on School Cards - 5 minutes

Let's say you've done your research and you're interested in attending **Dartmouth Collegeo**.  How would you go about finding **Dartmouth College** on the Comparison Tool?  When you find what you're looking for, you can say "I found it".
 
Things to watch for:
- Does the user notice the ratings on the school cards?

Upon completion of task:
- How did you think that went?
- What do you think of school card?
- What do you think of the ratings that you see?

Research questions:
- What do users think of the new school card layout?
- Are users interested in sorting or filtering search results by star ratings?
- What do users think of the ratings?


## Second Task: Initial Look at Ratings - 15 minutes

Since you've found the school, how would you go about determining if **Dartmouth College** would be a good fit for you?
 
 Things to watch for:
- How does the participant open the school profile page (School name or View Details link)?

Upon completion of task:
- How did you think that went?
- What do you think of the school now that you've seen the ratings?
- What do you think of the categories?
  - What do you think "True to expectations" means?
  - Some categories say that a certain number of individuals did not rate, what do you think of that?
- Where do you think the ratings come from?
- Do you have any questions about the ratings?

Research questions:
- What do users think of the star ratings?
- How does the overall rating weigh into the user’s perception of the school?
- How do the individual ratings weigh into the user’s perception of the school?
- Do users understand the “Not yet rated” indicators?
- Do users think the “Not yet rated” scores affect the overall score?
- What do users believe “True to expectations” means?
- What do users think of the “About Ratings” content?
- Are there any aspects of the ratings design that users find confusing?
- Do users think the ratings are useful?

 ## Third Task - Comparing Prestigious Schools - 15 minutes
 
Let's say you are considering attending either **Stanford University** or **Dartmouth College**. Both schools have the program you're interested in and you plan on moving to an apartment close to the school you attend.  Walk me through how you'd use the Comparison Tool to help you decide which school you'd attend.
 
Things to watch for:
- How does the user compare schools (look at them one at a time, open multiple tabs, etc.)?

Upon completion of task:
- How did you think that went? 
- What do you think of the schools now that you've seen the ratings?
- Which school would be a better fit?  Why?

Research questions:
- Are users interested in the different rating categories or just the overall score?
- Which categories are valuable to users?  Are there any categories that aren't valuable?  Are there any additional categories they would like to see?
- What do users think the different categories mean?
- How do users think the rating scores are determined (average of submitted scores, calculated value, etc.)?
- How trustworthy are the ratings?
- How do users think ratings are collected?
- What level of privacy do users expect if they would provide a rating?
- Do users think the ratings are useful?
