# School Ratings Discussion Guide


*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Amy and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we would be looking at the Comparison Tool and talking about ratings and what information is helpful for Veterans when determining if a particular school is a good fit for them.  
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?" 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
  - Have you ever used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before? 
    - If yes, what did you use it for?
 
 - Are you currently using or have you ever used your education benefits?
   - If yes, which benefit are you using?  
       - When did you start school?  Where did you go?
 
   - If no, do you plan on using your benefits in the near future?  
       - Which benefit?  
       - Where are you in the school selection process?
   
 - When you were trying to pick a school, what were you looking for in a school?  
    - How would you determine if it was a good fit for you?
    
 - If you knew a fellow Veteran who'd attended a school you were interested in, what would you most want to know from them?
  
## First Task: Initial Look at Ratings - 5 minutes

Let's say you received a scholarship for **Insert school** and are curious if the Comparison Tool has any information on that school.  How would you go about finding **Insert school** on the Comparison Tool?  
 
 Things to watch for:
- Does the user notice the ratings on the school cards?
- Does the user interact with any of the filters?

Upon completion of task:
- How did you think that went?
- What do you think of school card?
- What do you think that rating shows you?

Research questions:
- What do users think of the star ratings?
- Who do users think are providing the ratings?


 
 ## Second Task - Detailed Ratings - 15 minutes
 
You've heard great things about the Veteran experience at **Insert school**, but are curious about the quality of education you would receive there.  How would you use this Comparison Tool to see if **Insert school** would meet your needs?  

Things to watch for:
- How does the user select the school (School name or View Details)?
- Where does the user initially look for information?
- Does the user go to the ratings accordion without a prompt?

Upon completion of task:
- How did you think that went? 
- What do you think of the school now that you've seen the ratings?

Research questions:
- Are users interested in the different rating categories or just the overall score?
- Which categories are valuable to users?  Are there any categories that aren't valuable?  Are there any additional categories they would like to see?
- What do users think the different categories mean?
- How do users think the rating scores are determined (average of submitted scores, calculated value, etc.)?
- How trustworthy are the ratings?
- How do users think ratings are collected?
- What level of privacy do users expect if they would provide a rating?
- Do users think the ratings are useful?


 ## Third Task - Comparing Various Rating Aspects - 10 minutes
 
Let's say you want to attend the **University of California** and are trying to decide on the campus where you'll take classes.  You plan on living on-campus and all the schools offer the classes you want to take.  Walk me through how you'd use the Comparison Tool to help you decide which campus you'd attend.
 
 Things to watch for:
-  Does the user look at the overall rating or delve into the detailed ratings?
-  Does the user pause or read the caution flag?

Upon completion of task:
- How did you think that went? 
- What made you decide to pick that particular campus?

Research questions:
- Would ratings affect the school selection process?
- How does the number of ratings weigh into a user's perception of a particular school?
- Do users think the ratings are useful?


## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
-	Do you have general thoughts or feedback on the Comparison Tool that you’d like to share? 
-	Any questions for me?
- I want to give a chance for the other people on the line to ask a question.

## Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, thanks so much and enjoy the rest of your day!
