# Research Plan for Beta Testing for GIBCT
As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	

## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	

- Booz Allen research for Education Service/OIT

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

The VA team has fully redesigned the GI Bill Comparison Tool and conducted multiple rounds of testing to assess its effectiveness.  The team seeks to conduct a large scale usability test to ensure that the tool works well for a wide variety of users.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	

- Are users able to effectively utilize the search(es) to find institutions?
- Are users able to use the comparison functionality?
- Do users believe the information on the profile pages is valuable to them?
- Can users determine the specific benefits they would receive at a particular institution? (Customize to their situation)


5. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	

Researchers believe that individuals will be able to use the tool to find schools that accept VA education benefits, learn more about those schools and compare potential school options against one another.

## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  - Remote unmoderated usability testing with a follow-up survey
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	
- Researchers need to assess the effectiveness of the tool on a large scale audience in a realistic scenario.  Unmoderated usability testing allows users to interact with the tool in their natural environment and utilize the tool without input or prompting from a facilitator.

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? 	
 - Online using a sandbox for the tool (https://staging.va.gov/gi-bill-comparison-tool-sandbox/) and SurveyMonkey for the survey
 
4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 	
- We will be testing page content, navigation and general usability.

5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	
- GIBCT Sandbox (https://staging.va.gov/gi-bill-comparison-tool-sandbox/) and SurveyMonkey


## Participants and Recruitment
