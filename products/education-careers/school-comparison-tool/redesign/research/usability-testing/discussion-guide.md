## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Amy and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about searching and comparing schools on the GI Bill Comparison Tool. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions  - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Are you currently using or have you ever used your education benefits?
     - If yes, which benefit are you using?
          - When did you start school? Where did you go?
     - If no, do you plan on using your benefits in the near future?
          - Which benefit?
          - Where are you in the school selection process?
                    
 - When you were first looking for schools, how did you go about finding potential options? What was important to you?

- Have you ever used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before?
     - If yes, what did you use it for?


## Initial Take - 5 minutes ##
This is the GI Bill Comparison Tool, which allows you to see the benefits you can receive at various schools.  Can you tell me what your initial thoughts are when you see this page?  What do you think you can do here?


## First Task: Radius from Location - 10 minutes

- Let's say you aren't sure what you want to major in, but you live in **Daytona, Florida** and want to find a school within 10 miles of your location because you don't want a long commute.  How would you use the Comparison Tool to find schools that are within that driving distance?


### Things to watch for:

- Where does the user look to enter the search criteria?
- Do they click the search fields?
- What dropdowns (if any) do they open?
- What location format do users say they would input?

### Upon task completion:
 - How did you think that went?
 - On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very easy and 5 is very hard, what did you think of finding schools by distance from location?
 - Looking at the benefits for these schools, let's say someone had only served in the military for 2 years.  Do you think these numbers accurately represent the benefits they would receive?  
       - If not, how would they go about determining what benefits they would receive?
 - How do you think the school search results were sorted?
 - Was there any other information you were expecting to see?
 
 **Can you please return to the GI Bill Comparison Tool Home Page?**
 
 ### Things to watch for:

- How does the user try to get back to the home page?
 
 
## Second Task: Degree / Program Search - 10 minutes

- Let's say you've recently heard of someone who received a Bachelor's in **Citizenship Activities**. You don't know of any schools that offer this program, but  are curious about what the program would be about.  How would you use the Comparison Tool to see if any schools covered by the GI Bill offer this as a program of study?

_Prompt_ You see that **Indiana University-Bloomington** is highly rated by Veterans. If you wanted to ask a few questions about the school, how would you use the Comparison Tool to find out who to talk to?

_Prompt_ Where would you go to see how much tuition would be covered at **Indiana University-Bloomington**? 


### Things to watch for:

Part 1
- Where does the user look to enter the field of study?
- Do they click the search fields?
- What dropdowns (if any) do they open?
- Do they open the "Level of degree" dropdown?

Part 2
- Does the user click any of the jumplinks or just scroll?

### Upon task completion:
 - How did you think that went?
 - On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very easy and 5 is very hard, what did you think of finding schools by program of study?
 
 - What do you think of the school cards?
 - How do you think the school search results were sorted? (Why were some schools higher or lower on the list?)
 - Was there any other information you were expecting to see?


## Third Task: Compare Schools - 15 minutes

Looking at these search results, let's say you're interested in **University of Massachusetts-Amherst** and **Indiana University-Bloomington**.  How would you go about comparing these two schools to see which school would be a better fit for you?

_Prompt_ After looking at these two schools, **University of Massachusetts-Amherst** doesn't look like a good option for you.  How would you remove that school from the comparison and add another in its place?

### Things to watch for:

- Is the user able to successfully add schools to the gutter to compare?
- Is the user able to navigate successfully to the Compare page?
- How does the user try and navigate back to the search results?

### Upon task completion:
 - How did you think that went?
 - On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very easy and 5 is very hard, what did you think of comparing schools?
 - How many schools would you want to be able to compare at one time?
 - What information is important for you to see when comparing schools?
 - Was there any other information you were expecting to see on the Compare page?
 - Was there any information you didn't think was necessary?
 - What did you think of the general layout of the page?

## Post-Task Interview - X minutes
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
