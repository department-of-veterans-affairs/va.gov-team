# Research Plan for CT Redesign - Search, Compare and Initial Profile Page
As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	
## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	
  - Booz Allen research for Education Service / OIT
  
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	
3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	
4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	
## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  - Remote moderated usability testing with high-fidelity prototypes 	
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	
3.	Where are you planning to do your research?
      - Online using Zoom 	
4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 
    - We will be testing the design, content and flow of the prototype
5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use	
 - Zoom
## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)	

Please list your participant criteria in two categories-
1. **Primary criteria / Must have** - what absolutely must be true in order to run your study? The clearer you can write this criteria, the easier it is to find matches for your study. (i.e. if your study will only work if you're talking to Veterans who have My HealtheVet premium accounts, mention that here. OR, if you are using a prototype tool that will not work well with screen readers, mention that as well.) 

2. **Secondary criteria / Would like to have** - what other criteria would strengthen your results?

*Pro tips for writing recruiting critera:* 
- If you have specific screener questions that YOU would ask a potential participant to determine eligibility for your study, list them here. For example, instead of saying "We want someone who has been to an urgent care facility recently", say "Have you been to an urgent care facility in the last 6 months? (Answer should be yes)"
- Do not assume that your recruiters or the participants know your products or requirements as well as you do. Provide links to products, clear descriptions, specifics, etc. 

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
 - Recruitment will be performed by Perigean Technologies

## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 	
2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	
3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.
4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.	Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.
5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	
## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker**
