# Discussion Guide for Comparison Tool Redesign (Veterans and Beneficiaries)

*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Amy and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your education journey - what's important to you in selecting schools, how you go about finding information and ways to streamline your experience with the VA. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

   - From what you see here, what information would be most helpful to you?
   - What information is NOT important to you?
   - Is there anything else you would like to see here? 

 Are you familiar with any of the following programs:
  - Student Vet Groups
  - STEM Scholarship
  - Yellow Ribbon
  - Would you be interested in learning more about these programs? 

## Final Topic: Making It Easier - 5 minutes

We've talked about researching and picking a school and also the Comparison Tool.

- If you could make the process of selecting a school simple and easy, talk me through what the ideal process would look like.
   - What type of information about a school would be critical to know?
   - What people or websites would you talk to to help make a decision?
   - Are there any parts of the Comparison Tool that you would change?

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
