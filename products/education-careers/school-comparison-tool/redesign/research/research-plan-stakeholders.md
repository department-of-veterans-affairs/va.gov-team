# Research Plan for Comparison Tool Redesign for Stakeholders
As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	
 - Booz Allen research for Education Services / OIT
 
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

Many changes and improvements have been made to the Comparison Tool over the past few years.  EDU would like to gain a better understanding of all the different users that utilize the Comparison Tool and their respective needs.  From this research, EDU hopes to fully redesign the Comparison Tool to better meet the needs of its users.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	

 - How are users currently using the Comparison Tool?
    - What information are they looking for?
    - What does it do best?
    - What challenges do they have with it?
 - Do users use/reference other tools to perform similar tasks?
 - Do users have any concerns or questions about the Comparison Tool?
 - Is any information or functionality lacking from the Comparison Tool?

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	

Researchers believe that the design of the Comparison Tool can be optimized by identifying the users of the tool and redesigning the tool to meet their associated needs.

## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  - Directed interviews, questionnaires and possibly group discussion
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 
  - Due to the wide variety of Comparison Tool users and their availability, Booz Allen will have to take multiple approaches to obtain the information needed.
  
3.	Where are you planning to do your research? 
 - Online using Zoom, WebEx or Microsoft Teams for interviews and group discussion; questionnaires for individuals that the Booz Allen team cannot reach directly.
 
4.	What will you be testing? 
 - Researchers will be determining the functionality, features and content that should be housed on the Comparison Tool.
 
5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	
 - Zoom, WebEx or Microsoft Teams
