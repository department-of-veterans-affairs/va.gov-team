## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jen and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about discovering information about schools on the GI Bill Comparison Tool. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- What is your military status (e.g. Veteran, child, spouse)?

     - If Veteran, which branch of service?


- Are you currently using or have you ever used your education benefits?

     - If yes, which benefit are you using? When did you start school?
     - If no, do you plan on using your benefits in the near future?
      - Which benefit? Where are you in the school selection process?

- Have you ever used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before?

  - If yes, what did you use it for?

## First Task: Notre Dame - 15 minutes

You've been interested in going back to school to study **Statistics**.  A friend of yours recommended **University of Notre Dame** in **Notre Dame, Indiana** to you.  How would you use the Comparison Tool to determine if **University of Notre Dame** would be a good fit for you?


### Things to watch for:

- What type(s) of search does the user conduct?
- Does the user notice the jumplinks?
- Does the user click the jumplinks?
- Does the user notice the Compare functionality?
- Does the user notice the religious affiliation in the heading?

### Upon task completion:
- How do you think that went?
- On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very easy and 5 is very hard, what did you think of finding more information about University of Notre Dame?
- What types of information would be important to you in looking for a school?

## Second Task: Covering Expenses - 10 minutes

You've noticed that the GI Bill won't fully cover the tuition at **University of Notre Dame**.  You've heard that some schools offer the Yellow Ribbon program, which offers additional financial assistance to GI Bill beneficiaries.  How would you use the Comparison Tool to see if **University of Notre Dame** offers the Yellow Ribbon program?

Follow-up:  Do you think you would be eligible for the program?  If so, how much of the remaining expenses do you think would be covered?


### Things to watch for:

- Where does the user look to find the Yellow Ribbon program?
- Does the user see the Yellow Ribbon program listed under EYB?
- Does the user find the Yellow Ribbon calculation in EYB?

### Upon task completion:
- How do you think that went?
- On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very easy and 5 is very hard, what did you think of discovering what financial assistance is offered by University of Notre Dame?
- If you finished researching University of Notre Dame and thought the school was the right fit for you, what would be your next step?

## Third Task: Compare Religious Schools - 10 minutes

- You're interested in taking a few classes on religion and you're curious what schools in the **Notre Dame** area might have a religious affiliation.  You know that **University of Notre Dame** is a Roman Catholic institution.  How would you use the Comparison Tool to find schools in **Notre Dame, IN** that have a religious affiliation and see how they compare against **University of Notre Dame**?  

### Things to watch for:

- Where on the tool does the user go to find religious schools?
- Does the user see/say anything about the religious affilation in the header?

### Upon task completion:
- How do you think that went?
- On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very easy and 5 is very hard, what did you think of comparing schools with religious affiliations?

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
