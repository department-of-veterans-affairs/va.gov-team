## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jen and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about discovering information about schools on the GI Bill Comparison Tool. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- What is your military status (e.g. Veteran, child, spouse)?

     - If Veteran, which branch of service?


- Are you currently using or have you ever used your education benefits?

     - If yes, which benefit are you using? When did you start school?
     - If no, do you plan on using your benefits in the near future?
      - Which benefit? Where are you in the school selection process?

- Have you ever used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before?

  - If yes, what did you use it for?

## First Task: Notre Dame - 15 minutes

You've been interested in going back to school to study **Geology**.  A friend of yours recommended **University of Notre Dame** in **Notre Dame, Indiana** to you.  How would you use the Comparison Tool to learn more about **University of Notre Dame**?


### Things to watch for:

- What type(s) of search does the user conduct?
- Does the user notice the jumplinks?
- Does the user click the jumplinks?
- Does the user notice the Compare functionality?
- Does the user notice the religious affiliation in the heading?

### Upon task completion:
- How do you think that went?
- On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very easy and 5 is very hard, what did you think of finding more information about University of Notre Dame?
- What types of information would be important to you in looking for a school?
