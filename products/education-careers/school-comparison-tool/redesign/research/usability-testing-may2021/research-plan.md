# Research Plan for Search Functionality for CT Redesign
As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	

## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	

 - Booz Allen research for Education Service / OIT

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

- The Booz Allen team has been working on a re-design of the GI Bill Comparison Tool.  Initial designs for the tool were created and tested in a prior iteration.  Due to several struggles that users encountered during testing, the team completely re-designed many of the pages and is now conducting a new round of usability testing to assess the new design.


3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 

General:
- Can users effectively interact with the search interface?
- What types of searches are users interested in running?
- What challenges do users have with the new interface (if any)?

Search Results and Filters:
- Do users think their search results are relevant?
- What do users think of the layout and information on the search results cards?
- Are users able to find and effectively engage with the filters?
- Do users believe the available filters are useful?
    - If so, which ones?
    - Are any filters missing?

Location search
- Are users able to effectively utilize the location search?
- Do users find the autocomplete helpful for location search?
    - If not, what would make suggestions more useful?
- How do users engage with the map and list view?
- Are users interested in using the radius option?
- Can users effectively use the radius option?


Estimate your benefits:
- Do user notice the benefit controls?
- Do users interact with the controls if settings aren't accurate?

Future investigation (unable to test due to functionality limitations):
- Do users understand the interaction between the map and list view?
- Are users interested in the "Use my current location" option?
   - If so, are they able to find the functionality?

5. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 
 - Since many of the designs have been simplified in the new design, researchers believe that users will be able to effectively search for schools using both name and location searches.
 	
## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  - Remote moderated usability testing in a staging environment
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 
- Remote moderated usability testing will allow us to observe how users interact with the search functionality. We will be able to see what the user looks at, clicks on and how they expect the functionality to work. It also allows researchers to ask questions about what the user is thinking as they are completing the tasks to gain better insight into their thoughts, actions and expectations.


3.	Where are you planning to do your research? 
 - Online using Zoom

4.	What will you be testing?

- We will be testing the design, content and flow of the screens.


5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)

 - Zoom
