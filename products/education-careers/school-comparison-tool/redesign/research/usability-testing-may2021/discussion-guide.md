## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jen and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding schools on the GI Bill Comparison Tool. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- [IF APPROPRIATE:] **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Are you currently using or have you ever used your education benefits?
     - If yes, which benefit are you using?
         - When did you start school? Where did you go?
     - If no, do you plan on using your benefits in the near future? 
         - Which benefit?
         - Where are you in the school selection process?

- Have you ever used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before?
    - If yes, what did you use it for?

## Initial Take - 5 minutes ##
This is the GI Bill Comparison Tool, which allows you to see what education benefits you can receive at various institutions.  Can you tell me what your initial thoughts are when you see this page?  What do you think you can do here?

## First Task: Location Search - 15 minutes

- Let's say you recently moved just outside of **San Antonio, TX** and you're curious what education options are available to you. You aren't sure what you want to study, but wanted to see what was in the area.  How would you use the Comparison Tool to see what opportunities are available in your area?  

### Things to watch for:

- Does the user click on Search by location or try to use the Search by name option?
- What search criteria format does the participant use (city, "city, state", "use my current location" etc)?
- Does the participant use the autocomplete?
- Does the user notice the "Update housing and tuition" accordion?

### Upon task completion:
- What do you think of the view you see here?
- What education options do you see here?
- How do you think the search results were sorted?
- What information would be important to you if you were choosing where to take training?
- Do you think these benefit estimates are correct for your situation?
- Was there any other information you were expecting to see?

- How did you think that went?
 - On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very easy and 5 is very hard, what did you think of searching for educational institutions by location?
 

## Second Task: Map Utilization - 10 minutes

- You found some good opportunities in San Antonio, but you know that Austin is northeast of San Antonio and might have some additional options.  How would you use the Comparison Tool to see all the training opportunities offered in both San Antonio and Austin?

_Prompt_ To help narrow down your search, you're interested in institutions that participate in the Yellow Ribbon program.  How might you go about narrowing down the list of search results? 


### Things to watch for:

- How does the user expand/interact with the map?
- Does the user try to enter any additional search criteria into the search fields?

### Upon task completion:
 - How did you think that went?
 - On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very easy and 5 is very hard, what did you think of finding educational institutions?
 - What do you think of how the map showed your results?
 - What do you think of the filters offered?  Which ones would you use?  Are there any you wouldn't use?

## Third Task: Find a Campus - 5 minutes

- Before you moved to San Antonio, you took a few classes at **ECPI University** and were close to completing an Associate's degree.  You want to see if there is a campus in your area so you can finish your degree.  How would you use the Comparison Tool to determine if **ECPI University** has a campus in your area? 

### Things to watch for:

- Which search option does the user attempt to use (name or location)?
- Does the participant use the autocomplete?
- How does the user attempt to search/filter results? 

### Upon task completion:
 - How did you think that went?
 - On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very easy and 5 is very hard, what did you think of finding educational institutions?
 

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
