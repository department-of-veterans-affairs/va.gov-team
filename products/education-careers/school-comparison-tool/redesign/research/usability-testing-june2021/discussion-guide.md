## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jen and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about looking for schools on the GI Bill Comparison Tool. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- [IF APPROPRIATE:] **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- What is your military status (e.g. Veteran, child, spouse)?
    - If Veteran, which branch of service?
    
- Are you currently using or have you ever used your education benefits?
    - If yes, which benefit are you using?
         - When did you start school?
    - If no, do you plan on using your benefits in the near future?
         - Which benefit? Where are you in the school selection process?
         
- When you first decided to go back to school, what factors were important to you in picking school options?
    - Do you remember any of the schools you were considering?

- Have you ever used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before?
    - If yes, what did you use it for?

## First Task: Finding schools - 5 minutes

- Let's travel back in time and say you found the GI Bill Comparison Tool when you were first exploring schools. Could you show me how you'd use the Comparison Tool to learn about schools you might be interested in attending?


### Things to watch for:

- What type(s) of search does the user conduct?
- Does the user notice the Compare checkbox?

### Upon task completion:

- How do you think that went?
- On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very easy and 5 is very hard, what did you think of finding schools on the Comparison Tool?
- Can you talk to me about the school cards you see here?
- For the benefit estimates you see here, do you believe these are accurate for your situation?

## Second Task: Comparing schools - 20 minutes

- Let's say you want to get a better idea of the differences between the schools you're considering. How would you use the Comparison Tool to determine which school would be the best option for you?

### Things to watch for:

- What type(s) of search does the user conduct?
- Does the user notice the Compare drawer?
- Do users notice the sticky header?
- Do users notice the "Highlight differences" functionality?
- Is user able to easily add schools to the compare tray?
- Is the user able to easily navigate to the compare page?

### Upon task completion:

- How do you think that went?
- On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very easy and 5 is very hard, what did you think of comparing schools on the Comparison Tool?
- Looking at the compare page, what do you think of the information you see here?  Which ones are most important to you? Is anything missing that would be important to you?
- What do you think of the process of comparing schools?
- What do you think of the "Highlight differences" functionality? Is it useful?
- 

## Third Task: YAY Harvard! - 5 minutes

- You found out that you were accepted into **Harvard**.  Even if you don't end up going, you're curious about how **Harvard** stacks up against some of the other schools on your short list.  How would you use the Comparison Tool to see how **Harvard** compared to some of your other school options?  

### Things to watch for:

- *If applicable,* can the user easily remove schools from the comparison?
- Where does the user go to remove schools (compare tray, compare page, search results)?

### Upon task completion:

- How do you think that went?
- On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very easy and 5 is very hard, what did you think of adding Harvard Law School to your school comparison?
-
## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
