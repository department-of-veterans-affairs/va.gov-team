# Research Plan for Compare Functionality for CT Redesign
As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	 	
## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	

- Booz Allen research for Education Service/OIT

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

- The Booz Allen team has been working on a re-design of the GI Bill Comparison Tool. One of the major updates for the re-design was to add functionality to enable users to compare schools. The team has created this new functionality and would like to test the design with users to see how well it performs.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 

Compare Drawer:
 - Do users notice the Comparison drawer?
 - Is comparison drawer behavior effective when the user conducts multiple searches to select schools?
 - How many schools do users think they can compare at once?
 
 Navigation:
 - Are users able to easily navigate between the search results, the comparison drawer and the comparison page?
 - How do users interact with the interface when they need to conduct multiple searches?
 - Which components/pages do users prefer to use to add or remove schools from the comparison?  Are they able to do this effectively?

Compare page:
- What data fields are users interested in comparing?
    - Which ones are most important?
    - Any fields they aren't interested in?
    - Any additional others they would want to see?
- Do users notice the sticky header?
- Do users believe the sticky header is useful?
- Do users notice the "Highlight differences" functionality?
- Do users find the "Highlight differences" functionality useful?

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 

- Researchers believe that users will be able to easily find, select and compare schools that they are interested in.  We believe that the fields being compared are important to users and will be useful in determining which school they would like to attend.

## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  - Remote moderated usability testing in a staging environment	
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	
 - Remote moderated usability testing will allow us to observe how users interact with the compare functionality. We will be able to see what the user looks at, clicks on and how they expect the functionality to work. It also allows researchers to ask questions about what the user is thinking as they are completing the tasks to gain better insight into their thoughts, actions and expectations.

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? 
 - Online using Zoom
 
4.	What will you be testing?
 - We will be testing the design, content and flow of the screens.
 
5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	
 - Zoom
