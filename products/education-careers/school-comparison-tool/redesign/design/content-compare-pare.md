Accreditation ([Learn more])

    { learn more modal, Learn more aria label: "Learn more about the different accreditation types and why it matters" }
    
    #### Accreditation and why it matters
    
    The goal of accreditation is to ensure the education provided by institutions of higher learning meets acceptable levels of quality. Accreditation matters if you plan to start school at one institution and transfer to another to complete your degree. Be sure to ask any potential school about their credit transfer policy.
    Schools are accredited regionally or nationally by private educational associations. While the Department of Education (ED) doesn't say whether regional or 
    national accreditation is better, a recent ED study revealed that, “Nearly 90 percent of all student credit transfer opportunities occurred between
    institutions that were regionally, rather than nationally, accredited.” Read the ED report on credit transferability to learn more about the accreditation
    process and types of accreditation, visit the [About this Tool] (https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/comparison_tool/about_this_tool.asp#accreditation_type)
    page.

    ####GI Bill students
    
    The number of Veterans, service members and family members using their GI Bill benefits attending this school in the last calendar year. This includes all
    chapters of the GI Bill program (e.g., Post-9/11, Montgomery GI Bill, Reserve Education Assistance Program, and Veteran Readiness and Employment). Keep in
    mind that differences in attendee numbers don’t necessarily mean one school is more military friendly than another. This information will be updated
    annually.

    {Size of institution modal, Learn more aria label: “This is the aria label”}
    #### Size of institution
    The size of institutions is based on calculation of full-time equivalent students (FTEs) which considers both full-time and part-time students. Two-year colleges are classified using a different scale than four-year and higher institutions 
    Two-year college sizes
    •	Very small two-year—fewer than 500 FTEs attend this institution
    •	Small two-year —at least 500 but fewer than 2000 FTEs attend
    •	Medium two-year —at least 2000 but fewer than 5000 FTEs  
    •	Large two-year—at least 5000 but fewer than 10000 FTEs attend  
    •	Very large two-year —10000 or more FTEs attend  
    
    Four-year college sizes
    •	Very small four-year – fewer than 1000 FTEs attend this four-year institution
    •	Small four-year —at least 1000 but fewer than 3000 FTEs attend
    •	Medium four-year —at least 3000 but fewer than 10000 FTEs attend
    •	Large four-year —more than 10000 FTEs attend

Active-duty service members and their spouses aren’t eligible for this program. (An active-duty service member’s dependent child using transferred benefits may be eligible if the service member is qualified at the 100% rate.)

    •	Provide students with a personalized form covering the total cost of an education program.
    •	Provide educational plans for all military and Veteran education beneficiaries.
    •	Provide accommodations for service members and Reservists absent due to service requirements.
    •	Assign a point of contact for academic and financial advising.
    •	Make sure all new programs are accredited before they enroll students.

    Foreign schools, high schools, on-the-job training and apprenticeship programs, residency and internship programs, and those who don’t charge tuition and fees aren’t asked to comply with the Principles of Excellence.
    We try to make sure this information is accurate, but prospective students should only use this as a planning tool. Principles of Excellence schools are updated quarterly.

    #### 8 Keys to Veteran Success
    The “8 Keys to Veterans’ Success” are steps that postsecondary institutions can take to assist Veterans and service members in transitioning to higher education, completing their college programs, and obtaining career-ready skills.
    Postsecondary institutions listed here have stated their support for the 8 Keys. However, this isn’t an assurance by the U.S. Department of Education that an institution has actually implemented the 8 Keys. It also doesn’t mean that these institutions are endorsed by the U.S. Department of Education.
    To learn more about accreditation, visit the U.S. Department of Education’s [8 Keys to Veterans’ Success page](Link to http://www.ed.gov/veterans-and-military-families/8-keys-success-sites)
