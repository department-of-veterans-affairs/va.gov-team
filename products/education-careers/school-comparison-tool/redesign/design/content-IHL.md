### About ratings 

We ask Veterans who have used their education benefits to rate schools they’ve attended on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, with 5 stars being the best rating. 

#### How ratings are collected

VA works independently to collect ratings from Veterans. We reach out to Veterans to provide a rating who have:
- Received a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) for benefits
- Transferred into or out of a school 
- Made a change to their program of study, **or**
- Completed their degree program 

Veterans rate schools on a number of categories. Those ratings are averaged to calculate the overall school rating. If a Veteran doesn’t rate a category, it has no effect on the category’s overall score. 

#### Veteran privacy

A school may ask us for a list of Veterans who rated their school, but we do not share individual ratings with schools. If an institution asks us for information on who rated their school, no information beyond what is publicly available on the Comparison Tool is shared with them that would tie an individual to their ratings.

#### Accreditation and why it matters
 
The goal of accreditation is to ensure the education provided by institutions of higher learning meets acceptable levels of quality.  Accreditation matters if you plan to start school at one institution and transfer to another to complete your degree.  Be sure to ask any potential school about their credit transfer policy.
 
Schools are accredited regionally or nationally by private educational associations. While the Department of Education (ED) doesn't say whether regional or national accreditation is better, a recent ED study revealed that, “Nearly 90 percent of all student credit transfer opportunities occurred between institutions that were regionally, rather than nationally, accredited.” [Read the ED report on credit transferability](http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2014/2014163.pdf)

#### Principles of Excellence

The [Principles of Excellence](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2012-05-02/pdf/2012-10715.pdf) are guidelines for educational institutions receiving federal funding. Schools that agree to participate will:

* End fraudulent and aggressive recruiting techniques and misrepresentation.
* Provide students with a personalized form covering the total cost of an education program.
* Provide educational plans for all military and Veteran education beneficiaries.
* Provide accommodations for service members and Reservists absent due to service requirements.
* Assign a point of contact for academic and financial advising.
* Make sure all new programs are accredited before they enroll students.
* Align institutional refund policies with those under Title IV.

Foreign schools, high schools, on-the-job training and apprenticeship programs, residency and internship programs, and those who don’t charge tuition and fees aren’t asked to comply with the Principles of Excellence.

We try to make sure this information is accurate, but prospective students should only use this as a planning tool. Principles of Excellence schools are updated quarterly.
