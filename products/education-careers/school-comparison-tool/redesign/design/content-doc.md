### Cautionary information

~Student feedback~ (remove heading)

#### NN student complaints in the last NN months 
Complaints displayed here are the number of closed, Principles of Excellence-related, complaints submitted to VA through the GI Bill Feedback Tool in the last 24 months. [Learn more or submit a complaint](https://www.va.gov/education/submit-school-feedback/introduction).

Before displaying complaints, VA confirms each school's identification using the Department of Education's (ED) [Database of Accredited Postsecondary Institutions and Programs](https://ope.ed.gov/dapip/#/home). We verify our facility codes against 2 ED identifiers -- the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE) -- to ensure the complaints are attributed to the correct institution.
