# Product Outline - Comparison Tool Redesign Discovery
---

## Overview
*After you've explored the problem and through testing / hypothesis have identified the ideal solution, write up one sentence describing the solution you'll be creating.*

## Problem Statement
###  Education services needs to understand who the users of the Comparison Tool are so they are better able to prioritize enhancemetns and new features that best meet the user needs. 
- **Who?** Education services
- **What?** Need to clarify who their target user is 
- **Why?** To better be able to define priority when it comes to enhancements to existing feature/creation of new features in the tool so that the tool that is created best meets the needs of the target user.
- **Where?** GI Bill Comparison Tool
### How might we build a tool that will be more widely utilized by the target user?
 
## Desired User Outcomes
- Define & prioritize customers (primary, secondary with Veterans as primary)
   - Veterans
   - Non-veteran beneficiaries
   - Service Members
   - School Officials
   - Congressional Members/Staff
   - Call center/help desk
   - GI Bill Monthly Stakeholder Meeting (Groups include VSOs + Veteran Education Success, Student Veterans of America)
   - VA Employees
   - Data providers
   - Schools as data providers
- List of critical functionality for the user has been captured. Consider the following: 
   - Compare schools
   - "logical searching" for schools
   - Apply for benefits from the CT
   - Geolocation/Mapping
   - Record updates by verified School Official
   - Could VA.gov app incorporate CT?
   - Reporting features
   - Most popular programs/degrees
   - School-specific costs & data  (beyond tuition & housing)
- The reasons why people use the tool is well understood
   - Understand customer needs and requirements
   - Understand government needs and requirements

## Undesired User Outcomes
- A representative group of users is not included in the discovery effort
- Critical functionality of the tool is missed in the discovery effort

## Desired Business Outcomes
- The target user of the reimagined comparison tool has been identified 
- Understanding of who is using the GIBCT now and for what reasons
- Identify a list of "must have" functionality in the tool
- Ability to prioritize functionality based on 
- Clarify the mission of the tool 

## Undesired Business Outcomes

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
#### Short-term: number of stakeholders engaged in the discovery effort, diversity of stakeholders involved
#### Long-term: 
 - A tool that is more widely used by the target audience
   - A challenge with this approach might be the ability to differentiate the types of users who are visiting the site now. 
   - Potentially utilize direct user feedback on the tool (Medallia / Foresee)
   - Increased utilization (Google Analytics)
   - More use of GI Bill benefits
   - Increased Yellow Ribbon usage
   - Number of users who apply after searching/from the GIBCT
   - Increasing rates of those who attend schools found using the tool
   - Fewer help desk calls/questions

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

## Assumptions
