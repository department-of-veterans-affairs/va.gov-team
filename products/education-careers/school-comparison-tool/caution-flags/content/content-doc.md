**Cautionary warnings and school closings**

VA applies caution flags when we, or another federal agency, have increased regulatory or legal scrutiny of an educational program. We recommend students consider these warnings before enrolling in flagged programs.

When VA receives notice that a school or campus location will be closing, we add a school closing flag to that profile. Once the closing date passes, we remove the institution from the Comparison Tool during the next system update. 

To learn more about caution flags, [visit the About this Tool page](https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/comparison_tool/about_this_tool.asp#CF).
