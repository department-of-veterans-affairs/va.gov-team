Includes several concepts that we could explore for our work on the Search Results page and the School Profile page.

## Questions for DEPO

* Has any research or testing been done on your behalf with users for Caution Flags or other card patterns specifically?

#### Search results page

* In the Comparison Tool Search Results page, two types of yellow flags are typically used in the school cards: Caution Flags and School Closing flags. In figure 3 above, you have an example showing a caution flag. Do you plan on sticking to a more generic warning alert or having more specific language about the type of warning, such as specifying when a warning is a school closure? If so, any thoughts on how multiple warnings could be displayed?

* Figure 3 above displays tags for Veteran Programs. We currently have 9 listed Veteran Programs with two of them potentially being removed (Distance Learning and Online Only). Even if the tags wrapped, that would still increase the height of the cards significantly if all 7 programs were listed. Many schools provide a great deal of Veteran Programs. Is the plan to include a summarized view of them and maybe show only the top 2/3 programs or potentially having an expand option there that users can click on? 

* Are you moving towards a singular, uniform display height for all cards regardless of the card's details? We have some institutions with very long names that can wrap over 4 or 5 times on mobile displays. See examples below:

* Language change for "You may be eligible for up to" and shifting the "monthly/annually" indicators next to the figures, eliminating icons
