# Caution Flag Prototype & Reduce Veteran Risk Discovery - Research Plan

Feb 18, 2019 – March 13, 2020

### Background

Within the GI Bill Comparison Tool, military-connected students continue to view profiles of institutions that have increased regulatory or legal scrutiny, even when those schools are flagged with “Caution” labels. They may apply to and even attend the institutions without being aware of these potential hazards.

### Problem Statement 

As a GI Bill beneficiary who is using the GI Bill Comparison Tool to compare schools, I'd like to know which schools have received cautionary warnings and may pose potential risks, so I don’t waste, or even lose, my benefits attending an institution that’s known to have critical issues. I'd like to make good use of my education benefits and receive a high quality education.

### Solution Hypothesis

By enhancing the design and content of the caution flags that appear on the Search Results and School Profile pages of the GI Bill Comparison Tool, potential GI Bill Beneficiaries will be deterred from considering schools with cautionary warnings. In addition, the content changes will help GI Bill beneficiaries better understand the nature of the cautionary warnings.

### Research Questions

The research is designed to answer the following questions:

#### Caution Flag on Search Results page and School Profile page

* Do the caution flags sufficiently deter GI Bill beneficiaries from exploring schools with cautions? 
* What, if any, content or design modifications would increase the effectiveness of the caution flags?
* Under what circumstances do GI Bill beneficiaries click through to the school profile page to learn more?
* Which flags, if any, are less of a deterrent to GI Bill beneficiaries?
* Do GI Bill beneficiaries feel they receive all of the necessary information at the moment they need it?
* What questions do GI Bill beneficiaries have regarding the content and meaning of the cautions flags?
* Are GI Bill beneficiaries interested in following the links to learn more about the cautions?

#### Reduce Veteran risk during school section

* TBD
* TBD
* TBD

### What knowledge will make us feel like the research process has been successful?

Observing that participants are quickly deterred from exploring schools with cautionary warnings as they engage with the GI Bill Comparison Tool will make us feel like the research process has been successful.

### What kinds of users do we need to talk to answer our questions?

The following users have been identified:
* GI Bill beneficiaries who are interested in obtaining an undergraduate degree and have not yet enrolled in a school.
   * 6 Veterans
   * 2 Dependents  

### What specific questions do we need to ask on our Usability Testing screener to get the right kinds of users to test the form?

In addition to the standard questions, which ensure a representative mix of participants, the screener should include the following questions and responses to recruit:

### Screener questions

1.	Are you a Veteran or a family member or both?  
    * If more of this type of user is needed, to Question 2        
    * If not, end call  
2.  Are you eligible for GI Bill education benefits?  
    * If yes, to Question 2  
    * If no, end call  
3.	Have you enrolled in an undergraduate degree program?  
    * If no, would you like to participate?  
    * If yes, end call  

### What kind of user research do we want to conduct?

The following research methods will be used:

* Remote usability testing of a prototype with 6-8 GI Bill Beneficiaries

### What testing and recording tools do we need to run the research sessions?

Usability test sessions will be recorded via Zoom.

In-person notes will be taken by hand and/or on a computer.

### What artifacts do we need to support the research effort?

The following artifacts will be developed:
* Veteran Discussion Guide  
* Interactive Prototype

The Discussion Guide will be ready by: February 24, 2020.
The Interactive Prototype will be ready by: March 2, 2020.

### Who will fill the team roles?

* Screener writers: UX Team
* Recruiter: Perigean Recruiting Firm
* Discussion guide writer: UX team
* Moderator: UX Team
* Note-taker: Amy Knox and Cindy Cruz
* Observers: UX Team, Education Services & DEPO
* Research readout writer: UX Team

### When do we want to conduct the testing?

Usability Testing will be conducted on March 3rd & 4th, 2020.

Timeslots will be: 
* Mar 3: 11AM, 1PM, 3PM, 5PM 
* Mar 4: 9AM, 11PM, 1PM, 3PM, 5PM 

Each session will last no longer than 45 minutes.  

A debrief among team members will be held immediately after each session.  

Findings from will be synthesized once all sessions have occurred and a findings report will be made.  

### When will recruiting occur?

Recruiting needs to be complete by: March 2, 2020
