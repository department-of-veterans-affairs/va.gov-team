# Caution Flag Prototype & Reduce Veteran Risk Discovery - Research Plan - Prototype Research Discussion Guide  

## Introduction 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME]. I also have several colleagues on the line.  They’ll be observing and taking notes to ensure that we capture your feedback accurately. 

We work with a team at the VA that is enhancing the VA.gov website.  We're interested in speaking with you today about the process of selecting a college. Specifically, we'll be looking at the GI Bill Comparison Tool on VA.gov. We're reviewing a new feature of the Comparison Tool with people who plan to use their benefits soon to ensure that it's easy to use.

The entire session should take less than 45 minutes.

Throughout the process, we are interested in hearing your honest opinions. We are in no way testing your knowledge or ability. We just want to hear your ideas and be sure the form meets Veterans’ needs. You are welcome to express any opinions you wish. We welcome your feedback. If for any reason you want to pause or stop the session, please let me know. I'd be happy to do so. Do you have any questions before we get started?

**Recording**

We like to record sessions in case we need to confirm  we captured your opinions accurately. Are you comfortable if I record the audio and screen movements as we talk? 

Great! I'm going to turn the recording on now.  Once it starts, I’ll ask again if you are okay if we record, so we have your verbal consent.

[The meeting host will begin audio and screen recording.] 

Are you comfortable if I record the audio and screen movements today? Thank you. 

**Warm-up Questions**

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions 

1.	We are curious to know where are you on your educational journey. Have you already decided what you'd like to study and where you'd like to go to school, or are you just starting the process?

2.	As you think about comparing colleges, what 3 factors are most important to you?


**Think Aloud**

While you are going through the site, we ask that you please think aloud and vocalize your thoughts, and decisions. We are interested in your first reaction to each page.  The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn.  Thinking aloud may seem strange at first, but it helps us understand what aspects of the design work well and where we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free to ask them along the way.

### Scenario 1: GIBCT with full functionality   [Production site]. 

Let's say you've heard great things about Arizona State University's online degree program.  Starting on this page, how would you research Arizona State University?  

**Questions**  
1. What are your thoughts on that process?  

**Prototype**  

So far, we've been looking at the real VA.gov website.  Now we're going to shift gears and review a clickable prototype that has some new functionality.  

Just so you know, the prototype is a mock-up, rather than a real website.  This means only certain links have been activated and you’ll see pretend data in some areas. In some cases, as soon as you click you'll see an example of what someone might type in the fields.  We do this to save you time and eliminate the need for you to type.  If you click something and nothing happens, we can talk about what you expect might happen.

### Scenario 2: School with one warning   [Prototype]  
  
Let's say your friend is studying cybersecurity at Atlantic Institute and you're thinking about enrolling in the same program.  Using this site, how would you learn more about Atlantic Institute?  

**Observe***
* How did the participant react to the caution flag?
* Is the participant naturally interested in clicking the record or learning more about the warning.  

**Questions**  
1. What were your thoughts when you first noticed the warning message?  
2. As you read the warning message, what thoughts, questions, or reactions come to mind?  
3. What additional information would help you determine whether or not to attend Atlantic Institute?  

&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 

### Scenario 3: School with multiple warnings   [Prototype]  
  
Let's say you've just moved to Arizona and would like to compare schools.  Using the comparison tool, how would you determine what schools you might be interested in attending in Arizona?  

**Questions**  
1. Which of these schools might you consider and why?  
2. What are your thoughts on <Name of school with multiple caution flags>? Might you attend that school? If not, why?  
3. What questions do you have about the warning messages you see on this page?  
4. Under what circumstances might you attend a school with a warning message?  
[If they haven't already, have them click into the School Profile page]  
5. What are your thought on the warnings you see at the top of this page?  
[If they haven't already, have them view the flags in the accordion]  
6. What are your thoughts on the warnings you see further down the page?  

**Observe***
* How did the participant react to the caution flag?
* Did the participant, click the school with the caution?  If yes, to learn more about the school or the caution? 
* On the School Profile page, did the participant automatically click the jump link

&nbsp;

### Scenario 4: Refine search   [Prototype]  

Looks like there are [56] schools in [City]. Let's say you want to focus your search on specific types of school that meet your criteria, how might you narrow down the list of schools?  

[Let the participant know that on the real site, the number of results will change as they make selections.]  

**Observe***
* Does the participant understand that the left column controls the right column?
* Does the participant use the exclude schools with warnings filter?

**Questions**  
1. Did you notice the filter that let's you exclude schools with warnings?  
2. What are your thoughts on this filter?  
3. How likely would you be to use this filter?

&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 


### Task 5: Review Caution Flag Language   [Graphic with pairs of Caution flags]  
There are actually 17 possible flags. We'd like to hear your thoughts on the language of these flags.  Specifically, we'd like to know if you think people would find any of the wording confusing.  Our goal is to make sure each message very easy to understand.  

1. What wording might others find confusing? 
2. Do any of these warning seem so minor that you might consider going to the school? 
3. Would you like to see the detailed version of the flag on the Search Results page, or would you prefer to click into the School Profile page to see it?
