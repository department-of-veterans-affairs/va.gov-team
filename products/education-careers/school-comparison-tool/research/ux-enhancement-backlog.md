##### *Questions about some labels (meaning and significance):
* single point of contact for veterans: "true", ---"I don't know what to make of that"
* SOC - servivemember opportunity college member popup is totally unhelpful, still dont' know what it is
* ED ipeds/ope "is wonky, I'm sure that's helpful for someone.. but not useful causally"
* not sure what the purpose of complaints were -- wanted to read/know what it was
* kicker feels vague, I'm not sure if this is right. I don't know where I would go to find this information (""I never found it I just got higher checks"")
* wasn't sure what heightened cash monitoring label was -- wasn't expecting explanation of a warning flag)
