# Notes

## Session1: Edgar
Joined Navy out of High School
Corp man of Marine Corps – 2011 (up until 9-11)
Masters in Linguistics and Political Science

### Experience with VA Benefits
- 2012 – Medical Appt at the VA
- Mont. GI Bill – given pamphlets but in college, there were good information centers and people were good at answering questions
- Would go through people he knows for help instead of calling the VA or the channels available. 

### Sites user visits
-	LinkedIn – For career
-	Facebook – Personal
-	Twitter -- for work
-	Instagram –catalog all running adventures 

Education Info
-	Reason for choosing University of Florida:
	 - Wanted to be academically challenged
  - Be near family
  - Florida is home
-	Stayed away from other Veterans at school
  -	Veterans had a snobbiness around them – “these students are kids”
-	Primary things looking at for schools - Rankings of US news and websites
-	Didn’t know anybody who had taken GI Bill path so asked people at Veteran Centers at school

### Prototype
- When asked to look for GI Bill, user talks about having a 4th box – Probably label it “school”
- First Impressions of Education Benefits Page:
 - “There is not enough information on it”
 - "The design doesn’t really pop out at you."
 - There should be a link to a tool that allows you to access benefits. 
 - Whole tools and program section could pop up more. 
 - They look like sidelines (after thought?)
 - User had used GIBCT before and had to call to find it on the site

### Applying for School
- Described it to be "Clear and Concise"
- Estimated benefits (cost) is most important on the page; Other things: Ratings
- Most unnecessary information: Veteran summary, 
- Ratings – I see why it’s helpful but not enough. It needs to be more like estimated benefits. The actually ratings do not pop out.
- Purpose of ratings is to inform Veterans. 
- Rating is for the Veteran
- Utilize ratings to find a school of choice
- Veterans may see this as a “VA rating” – it’s bad in that it can be misleading, it’s good in that it might help Veterans find a school
- Should be more specific like student rating instead of average rating
- Veteran Friendliness- Ambiguous term. How well they take care of veterans. Different veterans will interpret that in different ways
- Veterans Preparation- How school preps veterans to get a job
- Recruiting might be the most unnecessary


Current Vets.gov
- User is a "reader"
 -	Have more on benefits. More descriptions on GI Bill and Mont. GI Bill and how they are different. 
 -	The GI Bill page feels like an afterthought. “I need more information”
-	Veterans student organization information can be helpful
-	Including groups or student veterans center.  Something that is more one-on-one

## Session2: Ryan
- Digital Communications Manager Veterans Students Org.
- Undergrad – Florida U – Policy Sci
- Grad – Syracuse – Master of Public Administration
- When choosing school, looks into school alumni, students, administration

### School Page
- Expects all 1 stars to disappear at yellow ribbon checkbox on School Features
- Assumes ratings are coming from students from school
- Trust reviews; Volume of Ratings matter
- People are more likely to leave negative reviews
- Veteran Friendliness: Veteran staff friendliness, more around school and campus 
- Recruiting Marketing Practices: Tactics admissions office would use to recruit. Experience vs. what was actually marketed to students


## Session3: Kristen
### Background
- Active Duty Navy from 2010-2015, now Navy Reserves
- Deployed 4 times (Kuwait, Bahamas, Africa, some other island)
- Vice president of SVA at her school
- Student @ Alburtus Magnus (CT) -- pursuing a BA in Health Management, wants to work as a patient navigator at the VA
- Online often - uses Facebook, MyPay, School website, not really any social media sites, yelp sometimes to find businesses (reads the reviews)
- Prefers to look for answers to questions online rather than looking for a phone number to call
- Has left a few reviews for businesses on Facebook that she thinks are exceptional, never leaves a negative review unless something was really really bad. 
- 

### Services at the VA
-	Vocation Rehab counselor meeting – Yearly meets face to face and does video counseling
-	Use Healthcare at VA;	Private doctors sends record to VA
-	Use eBenefits daily but currently frustrated Won’t let me update address 


### Applying for school
- got help and advice from mentors in her batallion + family
- only applied to 1 school
- least important things to her is campus life
- things that are important to her:
 - Veteran friendy (like if they take yellow ribbon or have a veteran student group..)
 - Small student/teacher ratio
 
 
### Navigation
- From homepage, clicked on Education *"I'd just click on this quickly to see if there's a quick link before I use search."* **DID NOT find anything that would help her find any information that would help her chose a school.**
- Next, went to search to type in "Argosy" *"I wouldn't click on GI Bill because I'd save the application step for last."*
- (What if we change the label of GIBCT??)

### School page
- Thought the information must come from another trusted government site, like dept. of education
- most helpful/important information:
 - Tuition $
 - Housing $
 - Veteran friendliness (one of the ratings)
 - # of veterans is the school
- "I wish there was a tool to tell us about our benefits remaining and tells you what you can do with the remaining credits you have"
- thought ratings were from a survey of veterans (and then rendered manually by the VA?)
- Said she'd trust the ratings, but would google search to confirm that they are in fact correct

### Argosy Task:
- Would go to school website to 
- Caution Flag expect a dropdown or pop up with information
- Resolution to the student complaints 
- Reading Average rating is helpful 
- It’s hard to cluster a group of veterans and rate friendliness because everybody has a unique experience
- Benefits calculator is the ballpark of what user is looking for
- User leaves good ratings


### Suggestions:
- "The VA doesn’t tell students that they can apply for FAFSA. Students should know what all benefits are." 
- Instead of GI Bill Comparison Tool to: 
  - School Comparison
  - Compare Schools 
  - Search Approved Schools
- Love school features – Student veterans group** AND # of GI Bill Students 
- Wish there was link under the tools & program – living allowance calculator 
- Consider for those who are moving
- Some people need the allowance of cost of living
-	Copy change: Apply to “use” your GI Bill
-	Having a link to guidelines about payment, transfer and extra credits
-	Defining your benefits link or content would be great
-	Add a “What if” section because there are a lot of rumors around education benefits and eligibility around students
