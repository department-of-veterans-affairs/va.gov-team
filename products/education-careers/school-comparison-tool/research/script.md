# GIBCT Ratings User Research
*April 28, 2016*

## Objectives ##
The team will conduct sessions with 4 to 5 users to evaluate the concept of ratings feature. 

The purpose of each session is to explore: 

	1. Veteran's attitudes and preferences related to ratings features
	2. Veterans reactions to a rating feature on the GI Bill Comparison Tool
	3. Liklihood that veteran's would use this feature in real life


### Welcome and Opening Remarks (5 minutes)###
*[When the participant is ready, the moderator will begin the session with the following introduction.]*

Thank you for joining us today. My name is [NAME] and we also have [NAME OF OTHERS OBSERVING] observing and taking notes for this session. We are doing this website feedback session on behalf of the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs working to build Vets.gov.  

The team wants to evaluate the some parts of the vets.gov website related to education — to make sure that the site is helpful and easy to use.

In this session, I’ll ask you to look at some things on the site and then we'll have a conversation. 

Before we begin, I’d like to make a few things clear and explain how the session will work.  

  * We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.  
  * We aren’t testing your ability. We’re just trying to figure out what works well on the website, and what doesn’t work well. So there are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions and what you think so that we can make the site better. I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.  
  * This entire ession should take about 30 minutes or less. 
  * We’ll be recording the screen activities as we look at the site. Recording our discussion today will help us capture everything you say accurately.  
  * If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop. 
  * As we're going through the session, I'd like you to think out loud....   

Do you have any questions at this stage?

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.  

* Tell me about the last time that you accessed a service from the VA. 
* What other services have you used from the VA? [PROMPT: GI Bill? Disability benefits? Healthcare?]  
* Where do you usually go if you have a question about services available to you as a veteran from the VA?  
 * Do you ever go online for this information? If so, what websites do you usually go to?
* What kind of things do you do online? (What websites and apps do you use the most?)
* Tell me about what it was like to apply to school. 
* How did you decide what schools to apply to?
* What were the important factors you looked for in a school?
* What would you say was most important to your decision?
* What was least important to your decision?
* What kinds of resources did you use to look at schools?
* What kind of people did you get advice from? Who did you trust the most?


### GIBCT Prototype (15 minutes)###
Okay, now I'm going to show you a draft website. Not everything is working quite yet, so if you click on something and it's not working, just tell me what you would expect to happen. 

Thinking back to when you were looking at schools — I'd like you to use this website to look for a school and find some information that might help you decide if you want to go there. So let's say that you are looking at Argosy University in Chicago — can you show me how you would find more about this school to decide if you'd want to apply?
