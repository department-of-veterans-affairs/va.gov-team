### Protection against late VA payments

If VA is late making a tuition payment to a GI Bill school, the school can’t prevent a GI Bill student from attending classes or accessing school facilities. 

Schools may require students to provide proof of their GI Bill eligibility in the form of:

*	Certificate of Eligibility (COE) **or**
*	Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and additional criteria like an award letter or other documents the school specifies

**In addition, schools can't charge late fees or otherwise penalize GI Bill students if VA is late making a tuition and/or fees payment.** This restriction on penalties doesn't apply if the student owes additional fees to the school beyond the tuition and fees that VA pays. Students are protected from these penalties for up to 90 days from the beginning of the term. 

Contact the School Certifying Official (SCO) to learn more about the school’s policy. [Read our policy on protecting students from late VA payments](https://benefits.va.gov/gibill/fgib/transition_act.asp).
