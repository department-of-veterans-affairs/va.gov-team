# 2016-12-09 Meeting Notes
Review of usability findings & other improvements

- Initial search screen
  - Order of operations doesn't match user need
  - Recommendation: reverse the order of steps 1 & 2
- Additional resources sidebar
  - Doesn't really help with the task at hand: finding my benefits by school
  - Users expected the links to be within vets.gov, surprised when most of them went to va.gov
  - Recommendation: Remove it!
- Review tooltips - which can we pull text out to show inline?
- Calculator data is skipped over
  - Blue box is not our normal usage - dynamic content changes and people don't notice
- Look at College Scorecard - https://collegescorecard.ed.gov
  - Good example for how to organize institution detail page
  - We should link to this somewhere in our tool - maybe the footer?
