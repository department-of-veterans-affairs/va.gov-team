### Questions

#### Search results page

- Listings
  - Looking at this page, what's the most important thing you want to know about each school or employer?
  - (look at a school with a warning label) What do you think this warning might mean?
  - (estimated benefits) What do you think these dollar amounts represent?

#### School/Employer detail page

- What information do you expect to find on this page?
- Calculate your benefits
  - What do you think this is for?
  - If you plan to go to school only part-time, how would you find out how much the GI Bill would pay you?
- Collapsed sections below calculator
  - What do you think these are for? (is it apparent to users that they are expandable?)
  - What kind of information do you think you would find in each of these sections?
