      <div><h2>accredited</h2>
        <h3>Is your school accredited</h3>
        <p>Accreditation matters if you plan to start school at one institution and transfer to another to complete your degree. Be sure to ask any potential school about their credit transfer policy. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) maintains a&nbsp;<a href="http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/" id="anch_384" target="_blank">database</a>&nbsp;of accredited postsecondary institutions and programs. Accreditation is a recognized credential for schools and some programs. As stated by the ED, the goal of accreditation is to ensure that the education provided by institutions of higher education meets acceptable levels of quality.</p>

        <h3>Accreditation types (Regional vs. National vs Hybrid)</h3>
        <p>Is the school regionally or nationally accredited at the institution level?</p>
        <p>Schools are accredited by private educational associations of regional or national scope. While the Department of Education does not say whether regional or national accreditation is better, a recent ED study revealed that, “Nearly 90 percent of all student credit transfer opportunities occurred between institutions that were regionally, rather than nationally, accredited.” <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2014/2014163.pdf" id="anch_386">http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2014/2014163.pdf</a></p>
