## InVision Caution Flags Prototypes:  

DEPO is moving towards a singular, scalable approach to cards throughout VA.gov. Part of that approach is creating a consistent alert system throughout the cards. Our task is to leverage some of the initial exploratory work they've done for  the display of caution flags on the search results of the GI Bill Comparison Tool so Veterans are less likely to explore schools with cautionary warnings.
