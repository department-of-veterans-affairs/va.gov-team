### Feedback & Outcomes

#### Initial Design/508 Review with DEPO:
02/21/2020  
Attendees: Cindy Cruz, Crystabel Reiter, Trevor Pierce, Theresa McMurdo, Jen Jones, Amy Knox

Outcomes
* DEPO Design: VA recommends not showing so many alerts at once as users start to gloss over their content
  * BAH UX: mentioned schools are not often flagged, and when they are, most flagged schools contain 1, maybe 2 alerts. It's rare to see schools with a greater number of alerts. The school closing alert is also quite rare in the Comparison Tool. Schools with many alerts are quickly taken off search.
* DEPO Design: Consider red warning alert for school closing flag
  * BAH UX: The guidance VA gives for the use of red alerts wouldn't necessarily apply in this context, as red error alerts are typically reserved for when there is a system issue or user error. 
* DEPO 508: Consider tier of alerts for assistive technologies. Would alerts be ranked in order of importance? Flag priority of alerts in the data, the API (eg. Priority 1, Priority 2, etc).
  * BAH UX: We will be discussing priority of alerts with EDU at a later meeting. School closing alerts are definitely the most urgent.
