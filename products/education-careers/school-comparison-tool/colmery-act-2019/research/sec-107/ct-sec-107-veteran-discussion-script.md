# GIBCT Colmery Act Sec 107 Veteran Discussion Script
*July 9, 2019*

### Welcome and Opening Remarks (5 minutes)
*[When the participant is ready, the moderator will begin the session with the following introduction.]*

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [name], and I also have two colleagues on the line, Amy and Cindy.  They are observing and taking notes. We work with a team at the VA that is enhancing the VA.gov website and we're interested in speaking with you today about the GI Bill Comparison Tool. 

The GI Bill comparison tool allows Veterans to learn about education programs and compare benefits by school. We’d like your thoughts on what aspects of the website work well and where we might make improvements to make things even easier for Veterans.

Before we start, I’d like to mention a few things:

*  We are interested in hearing your honest opinions. We are in no way testing your knowledge or ability. Our goal is to be sure that application meets Veterans’ needs. You are welcome to express any opinions you wish.  We welcome your feedback and look forward to hearing your thoughts and ideas.
*  By testing the site thoroughly, we hope to ensure that it’s written in a thoughtful way and gives Veterans all of the information they need to make informed decisions.
*  If for any reason you want to pause or stop the session at any time, just let me know. I'd be happy to do so.
*  Do you have any questions so far? 
*  Lastly, we generally record sessions, in case we need to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. 

Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today? 

Great! I'm going to turn on screen and audio recording now.  Once it's on, I'll ask again, as we like to have your verbal consent

[The meeting host will begin audio and screen recording.]

Are you comfortable if we record the audio and screen movements today? 

### Warm-up Questions (5 minutes)
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.  

1. Are you interested in using VA Education benefits in the future?
2. Have you used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before? If yes, what was your experience?
3. What factors are most important to you as you compare schools or institutions?

Okay, let's go ahead and walk through a few scenarios.

#### Think Aloud
While you are going through the site, we ask that you please think aloud and vocalize your thoughts and decisions. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn.  We are interested in your first reaction to each page, as well as what you are thinking as you engage with each page.   If you have questions about what information needs to go in a particular field, it’s likely that many other Veterans will too. Sharing your thoughts aloud may seem strange at first, but it helps us understand what you are thinking and give us valuable information.

#### Prototype
Okay, now we're going to look at the va.gov website and walk through a few scenarios.

Just so you know, this is a prototype, rather than a real website.  We create mock-ups like these and share them with Veterans in sessions like this to be sure we have everything right before we code the actual website.   You'll notice that only certain links have been activated and you’ll not need to enter any data.  When you click a field, text will appear automatically.

2. What aspect of the page or the process might other Veterans find confusing or unclear? Why?

### Scenario #2 (10 minutes)

Let say most of your classess at UC Davis will be held across town at the UC Davis Technlogy Center. Using the site, how would you determine what amount of housing you'd receive?

### Potential Probing Questions 

1. What are your thoughts on the question on the left ("Will the majority of your classes be on the main campus?")?
2. What would you expect to happen if you selected "Other"?

### Scenario #3 (10 minutes)

Let say you're interested in checking out University of California at Irvine. Using the site, how would you determine how much housing allowance you'd receive if you attended UC Irvine?

[If the participant navigates to UC Irvinte via the Search Results Page or search box, ask if there a way to access the UC Irvine page from the School Profile page?]

### Potential Probing Questions 

1. What are your thoughts on the listing of all campuses in the locations section?
2. Under what circumstances would you review a list like this?

### Scenario #4 #116 VET TEC Benefits Panel (10 minutes)

https://bahdigital.invisionapp.com/share/BXIAAZ0PHY3#/screens

The last scenario has to do with another version of this page that we are creating to support a new pilot program called VET TEC.  VET TEC allows Veterans to advance in IT careers by enrolling in high-tech training programs. 

Let’s assume you'd like to advance your IT career by taking advantage of the VA's new high-tech program. You have located a course that matches your interest and would like to determine what benefits you'll receive while attending the course. 

{ If we have time to start on the landing page, present the following scenario }

Let’s assume you're moving to Detroit, Michigan and you'd like to advance your IT career by taking advantage of the VA's new high-tech program.  Using the GI Bill Comparison Tool, how would you find a training course in Detroit and determine how much money you’d receive to help pay your rent while attending the course? 

### Potential Probing Questions 
1. What questions do you have regarding the tuition breakdown?  
2. What aspect of the Benefits panel might other Veterans find confusing or unclear? Why?  
3. What are your thoughts on the logo?  What does it mean to you when you see it? What do you wonder when you see it?
4. What are your thoughts on the Preferred Provider logo?

### Thank-You and Closing
*[The moderator concludes each session by thanking the participant for their time and for offering his/her opinions and suggestions.]*

Thank you very much for taking the time to give us your feedback today. We really appreciate your help!
