# GIBCT Colmery Act Sec 107 Round 3 
# IHL Veteran Discussion Script
*August 14-16, 2019*

### Welcome and Opening Remarks (5 minutes)
*[When the participant is ready, the moderator will begin the session with the following introduction.] *

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [name], and I also have two colleagues on the line, Amy and Cindy.  They are observing and taking notes. We work with a team at the VA that is enhancing the VA.gov website and we're interested in speaking with you today about the GI Bill Comparison Tool. 

Do you have any questions before we get started?

The GI Bill comparison tool allows Veterans to learn about education programs and compare benefits by school. We’d like your thoughts on what aspects of the website work well and where we might make improvements to make things even easier for Veterans.

By testing the site thoroughly, we hope to ensure that it’s written in a thoughtful way and gives Veterans all of the information they need to make informed decisions.

Before we start, I’d like to mention a few things:

*  We are interested in hearing your honest opinions. We are in no way testing your knowledge or ability. Our goal is to be sure that application meets Veterans’ needs. You are welcome to express any opinions you wish.  We welcome your feedback and look forward to hearing your thoughts and ideas.
*  If for any reason you want to pause or stop the session at any time, just let me know. I'd be happy to do so.
*  Do you have any questions so far? 
*  Lastly, we generally record sessions, in case we need to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. 

Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today? 

Great! I'm going to turn on screen and audio recording now.  Once it's on, I'll ask again, as we like to have your verbal consent

[The meeting host will begin audio and screen recording.]

Are you comfortable if we record the audio and screen movements today? 

### Warm-up Questions (5 minutes)
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.  

1. Have you used VA Education benefits in the past, or are you interested in using them in the future?
2. Have you used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before? If yes, what was your experience?
3. What are the 3 most important factors you consider as you compare colleges or universities?

Okay, let's go ahead and walk through a few scenarios.

#### Think Aloud
While you are going through the site, we ask that you please think aloud and vocalize your thoughts and decisions. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn.  We are interested in your first reaction to each page, as well as what you are thinking as you engage with each page.   If you have questions about what information needs to go in a particular field, it’s likely that many other Veterans will too. Sharing your thoughts aloud helps us understand what you are thinking and provides valuable information.

Okay, now we're going to look at the va.gov website and walk through a few scenarios.  All of the scenarios we look at are going to focus on housing allowance benefits. So, while there will be a lot of interesting information on the screen, we're really going to focus in on determining housing allowance.

#### Prototype 
[Skip if testing occurs in a live environment] 
Just so you know, this is a prototype, rather than a real website.  We create mock-ups like these and share them with Veterans in sessions like this to be sure we have everything right before we code the actual website.   You'll notice that only certain links have been activated and you’ll not need to enter any data.  When you click a field, text will appear automatically.

### Scenario #1 (10 minutes)

Let's say you're interested in going to the Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College in Jefferson MS (University of California at Davis). Using the GI Bill Comparison Tool, how would you determine how much money you'd receive to help pay your rent while taking classes at the Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College in Jefferson (University of California at Davis)?

Please talk aloud and let us know what you are thinking as you explore the site.

Great, now let's review the left column without clicking, let's talk through what values you might enter or select.

1. What would you expect to happen as you make that selection or enter that data?

2. What is your sense of why you are being asked to answer these questions?

[After the participant has explored the calculator fields and benefits panel]

### Potential Probing Questions 
1. What are your first impressions of the process of determining your benefits?
2. What aspect of the page or the process might other Veterans find confusing or unclear? Why?  	
3. [If calculator fields were not used] 
   Is there a way to make the estimate even more specific to your particular situation?
   [If calculator fields were used]
   What would make the process of refining the benefits estimate easier?
   What are your thoughts on the 2 choices: "This location" and "An extension campus"?
4. Would you expect to receive the same benefits if you were to attend University of California in another city?


### Scenario #2 (10 minutes)

Let say you're interested in checking out Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College in Jackson MS (University of California at Irvine). Using the site, how would you determine how much housing allowance you'd receive if you attended Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College in Jackson MS (UC Irvine)?

### Potential Probing Questions 

1. How'd you think that went?
   [If the participant navigates to UC Irvine via the Search Results Page or search box]
   Is there a way to access the UC Irvine page from the School Profile page?
2. What are your thoughts on the School locations section?
3. Why do you imagine that some are nested under others?
4. What benefit do you see in having a list like this?  


### Scenario #3 (10 minutes)

Let say you've decided that you prefer the Jefferson branch.  The information technology classes you'd like to take are held at the BRYANT CENTER (UC Davis Technology Center) Bryant, MS is a suburb of Jefferson, that is 45 minutes away. Using the site, how would you determine what amount of housing you'd receive while taking classes at the Bryant Center (Technology Center)?

### Potential Probing Questions 

1. How'd you think that went?
2. [If they use the campus calculator field]
   What are your thoughts on the question on the left ("Will the majority of your classes be on the main campus?")?
   [If they use the School Locations list]
   On this page, is there a way to make the benefits panel at the top update to show this housing amount? 
3. What would you expect to happen if you selected "Other..."?
4. What would make the process of selecting a campus easier?
5. What is the difference between the short list in the drop-down and the longer list at the bottom?

### Scenario #4 (10 minutes)

Let say you heard that UC Davis is open a brand new 45 minutes away, in Riverside, CA. Using the site, how would you determine what amount of housing you'd receive while taking classes in Riverside, CA?  (Davis 31539. Riverside 92505) 

### Potential Probing Questions 

1. How'd you think that went?
2. What thoughts do you have on the process of determining your housing allowance for a location that is not in the list?
3. What are your overall thoughts on the Comparison Tool?
