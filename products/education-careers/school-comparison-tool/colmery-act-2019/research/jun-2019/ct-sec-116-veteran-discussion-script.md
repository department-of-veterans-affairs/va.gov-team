# GIBCT Colmery Act Sec 116 Veteran Discussion Script
*June 3, 2019*

### Welcome and Opening Remarks (5 minutes)
*[When the participant is ready, the moderator will begin the session with the following introduction.]*

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [name], and I also have two colleagues on the line, Amy and Cindy.  They are observing and taking notes. We work with a team at the VA that is enhancing the VA.gov website and we're interested in speaking with you today about a pilot program called VET TEC. 

VET TEC is a tuition assistance program designed to help Veterans advance in IT careers by enrolling in high-tech training programs.  

We’d like your thoughts on what aspects of the website work well and where we might make improvements to make things even easier for Veterans.

Before we start, I’d like to mention a few logistical details:

*  We are interested in hearing your honest opinions. We are in no way testing your knowledge or ability. Our goal is to be sure that application meets Veterans’ needs. You are welcome to express any opinions you wish.  We look forward to hearing your thoughts and ideas and welcome your feedback.
*  If for any reason you want to pause or stop the session at any time, just let me know. I'd be happy to do so.
*  By testing the site thoroughly, we hope to ensure that it’s written in a thoughtful way and gives Veterans all of the information they need to make informed decisions.
*  Do you have any questions so far? 
*  Lastly, we generally record sessions, in case we need to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. 

Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today? 

Great! I'm going to turn on screen and audio recording now.  Once it's on, I'll ask again, as we like to have your verbal consent

[The meeting host will begin audio and screen recording.]

Are you comfortable if we record the audio and screen movements today? 

### Warm-up Questions (5 minutes)
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.  

1. What interest, if any, do you have in pursuing a career in the high-tech industry? 
2. If you were interested in attending a high-tech training program, how would you decide what course to attend?
3. What factors would be most important to you when selecting a course?
4. Have you used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before? If yes, what was your experience?


Okay, let's go ahead and walk through a few scenarios.

#### Think Aloud
While you are going through the site, we ask that you please think aloud and vocalize your thoughts and decisions. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn.  We are interested in your first reaction to each page, as well as what you are thinking as you engage with each page.   If you have questions about what information needs to go in a particular field, it’s likely that many other Veterans will too. Sharing your thoughts aloud may seem strange at first, but it helps us understand what you are thinking and give us valuable information.

### Review the VET TEC Overview Page (5 minutes)

https://vagov-content-pr-433.herokuapp.com/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/vettec-high-tech-program/

To give you a little more background on the VET TEC program, we'd like to share an overview page with you. Feel free to take as much time as you like reading the page and let us know when you are ready to continue.

Do you have any questions about what you’ve read?


#### Prototype
Let switch over to the Comparison Tool.  

Just so you know, this is a prototype, rather than a real website.  We create mock-ups like these and share them with Veterans in sessions like this to be sure we have everything right before we code the actual website.   You'll notice that only certain links have been activated and you’ll not need to enter any data.  When you click a field, text will appear automatically.


### Scenario #1 (10 minutes)
Let’s assume you'd like to advance your IT career by taking advantage of the new high-tech program.  You are interested in finding a local training course to attend.  Using the GI Bill Comparison Tool, how would you find a training course and determine how much housing allowance you’d receive while attending the course?

Please talk aloud and let us know what you are thinking.

*[After the participant has selected a program and shared thoughts aloud.]*

1. What are your first impressions of the process of searching for VET TEC providers and programs 
2. What led you to select [Program Name] over the others?
3. What information on these pages is the most valuable to you?
4. What aspect of the page or the process might Veterans find confusing or unclear? Why?  	


### Scenario #2 (10 minutes)

Let say you're interested in taking a web-based course to build your technical skills. Using the site, how would you find a couple of web-based courses?

*[After participant finds at least two online programs.]*

If you were going to attend one, how would you decide between the two?
