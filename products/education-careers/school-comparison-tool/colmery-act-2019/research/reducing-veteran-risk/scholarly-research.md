# Notes from Scholarly Research on Veteran School Selection #

Abbey, Derek.  Dissertation. “How Navy and Marine Corps Veterans Make Meaning of the College Choice Process in the Post-9/11 GI Bill Era” University of San Diego.  19 May 2019.

## Primary motivation for choosing college/university:
-	Location (Primarily Resident students)
  -	Factors/attachments tie them to a particular area – family, work, assets (own a home)
>	“Ten of the 12 participants focused their exploration on one region or city. Sometimes their reason for this focused search was because they did not want to return to their home region. However, most of the participants had established ties to the region they were in.”

-	Convenience (Primarily Online/Hybrid students)
  - Individuals who are still in military/may experience relocation due to job or other factors. 
>	“The two students that selected and continued their education at hybrid and online programs, selected these programs because the programs provided the flexibility to move and continue their education”

>	“For those without a tie to the region, convenience replaced this influence. Participants striving to complete their degree on active duty or who expected to move, selected programs, like online or hybrid programs, that allowed them to travel or move while continuing their studies with the same institution.”

## Factors in making a decision:
-	Social circle/relationships are a MAJOR influence
>	“10 of the 12 participants sought out and placed significant weight in these relationships while going through the college choice process.”

>	“The search phase for the students that participated in this study did not include an in-depth analysis of multiple programs and was heavily weighted on the input and perceived trust of others”

-	Internet was primary information gathering tool, but was research was cursory
>	“When exploring which university to attend in order to attain their four-year degree, the participants in this study did not conduct in-depth searches. The majority of the participants selected a region or city and then did brief research of local universities using online search engines or websites.”

-	Participants lacked knowledge related to higher education and the benefits they were intending to use
>	“Donald shared that he avoided private colleges because he was not aware of the Yellow Ribbon program”


## Search process:
-	General Process for Finding School: 
	1. Individuals searched by location and/or received recommendation from a social contact.  
	2. Individual confirmed that the institution had the major they were looking for 
	3. Individual applied (in many cases – only applying to ONE institution)
>	 “Although most of the participants attended more than one college, all of the participants only applied to one university when accessing the institution from which they would ultimately strive to attain their four-year degree. The participants decided on the college they wanted to attend, confirmed that it had the degree that they were seeking, and applied without a backup plan for their education”

>	“Participants did verify that their major of interest was offered at the college they were considering. However, the participants simply were confirming that the university offered the major they were interested in studying, it does not appear to be a significant influencing factor.”

-	Most participants did not seek a particular educational model (resident, online, etc.) – instead they focused on what they DIDN’T want (online classes, for-profit institutions).
>	“When the participants were asked if they sought out a specific educational model, most expressed that they wanted to take resident classes or did not seek a specific model. The two participants that applied for an online university and a hybrid university, sought the flexibility of these models because of their potential for traveling or moving while they were still in the military”

>	“More common in the participants’ answers were the models or systems that they were trying to avoid. Multiple students expressed that they did not want to attend an online university and many said that they were avoiding for-profit universities. David said, “I knew I wanted nothing to do with a for-profit institution.” One participant expressed that she did not want to go to a college that was a nationally accredited institution. When asked if she knew the difference between nationally and regionally accredited programs, Lynn expressed, “I just know that [nationally accredited programs] are bad.” Connected to the trusted relationships discussed above, these students avoided these models because someone they trusted told them to not go there, not because they understood the difference between the models they listed and others”

## Noted Limitations:
1. Only looking at students transferring from community college to public research universities
2. Only looking at students that had transferred to University of California schools

## Important Factors
-	Major
> Almost every survey respondent (91.2%) reported that that college major was “essential”or “important” to his/her college search. 

> “For the students who indicated that their major was important in their search phase, the simple offering of that major was what students cited as important to them when looking at transfer institutions”
	
-	Academic Quality / Prestige
> “In the survey, a quarter (25.9%) of respondents indicated that prestige was an essential factor in their college search process, and more than a third (40.7%) of respondents indicated that prestige was a very important factor in their college search”

> "All but three interviewees (85%) reported they were influenced chiefly by the academic quality of the institution, citing overall prestige, perceived quality of the faculty, and the availability of a particular major as particularly critical considerations"

-	Location
> “Specifically, when asked about the important of location in their college choice decision, many survey participants felt that the location of campus was very important or essential in their search (73.3%, n= 135) for a transfer institution”


## Sources of Information

- Internet
> “According to the survey results, 68.1% of participants reported that they used the Internet to a great degree and 25.5% of participants reported that they used the Internet to some extent when seeking out information to learn about the requirements and process for applying to a UC institution"

- Community College Transfer Centers
> "The survey results found that 33.3% of participants reported using their community college transfer center to a great degree,and 40.7% of participants reported that they used their community college transfer center to some extent when seeking out information to learn about the requirements and process for applying to a UC institution. Similarly, 17 out of 20 (85%) of students said that had used their community college transfer center at some point to seek out information to learn about the requirements and process for applying toa UC institution"

- Community College Veteran Center
> “The survey results found that 21.5% of participants reported using their community college veteran center to a great degree and 31.9% of participants reported using their community college veteran center to some extent when seeking out information to learn about the requirements and process for applying to a UC institution. Eleven out of 20 interviewees (55%) reported using their campus veteran center to learn about the requirements and process of transferring to a UC institution”

## Final Choice

- Major
> “The survey results found that more than half (57.5%) of participants reported that major was an extremely important factor used to make their college choice and more than a quarter (28.4%) of participants reported that quality of their major was very important to their college choice. Similarly, 16 of out of 20 (80%) of interviewees shared that academic major was influential to their final college choice.“

- Academic Reputation
> “The survey results found that more than half (57.5%) of the participants reported that academic reputation was an extremely important factor used to make their college choice and nearly a quarter (23.9%) of participants reported that the school’s academic reputation was very important to their college choice. Similarly, all but two of the 20 interview participants (90%) indicated that the institution’s academic reputation was important in their final selection of a transfer institution“

- Quality of Faculty
> “The survey results found that close to one half of participants (42.5%) reported that the quality of the institution’s faculty was an extremely important factor used to make their college choice and a third of participants (33.6%) reported that the school’s quality of faculty was very important to their college choice“


## Other factors
 > “Survey respondents rated that influences from faculty (58.2%), family (55.3%), friends (38.3%), and a community college counselor (34.6%) were extremely important or very important in their college choice“



Hill, Regina L. Dissertation. “Factors Affecting College Choice and Transfer: A Study of the Decision-Making Process of Student Veterans” Old Dominion University. Spring 2016.

## Factors to attend private for-profit institution 


-	Program offerings
> “One of the characteristics of for-profit institutions is that students are provided a clear and flexible pathway to degree completion including accelerated programs and on-line courses (McQuestion & Abelman, 2004)”

-	Ease of admission
> "Wilson (2010) asserted that the admission process at for-profit institutions is quick and easy to navigate with prospective students receiving a call from admissions within 15 minutes of making an inquiry.”

-	Receiving transfer credit for military experienced
> “Mary and other participants were concerned about receiving transfer credit for military experience. Transfer of military credit was an important factor in the college selection process for participants.”

-	Quick Time to Degree Completion
> “Participants noted that duration was an important factor in college choice; they indicated they were eager to start college but also welcomed the quickest route to degree completion.”

-	Location
> “Participant responses regarding location included, the college was close to work and home, it was in the area, and the college was conveniently located close to after school activities”

## Factors to transfer to community college

-	Location
> “Location was mentioned again as a reason for attending the community college.”

-	Social Relationships/Connections
> “Factors affecting decisions to attend a particular community college included: small class size, availability and flexibility of online courses, multiple locations, articulation agreements with four-year institutions, and positive experiences of family and friends who had attended the same community college.”


-	Convenience
> “The availability of online courses was especially important to single parents.”

> “Factors influencing the specific selection of Parkview Community College as the transfer school included multiple locations, flexibility, transfer opportunities, and creditability”
