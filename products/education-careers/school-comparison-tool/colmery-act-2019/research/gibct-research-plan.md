# Sprint Research Plan #
## GI Bill Comparison Tool ##
March 25, 2019 – June 7, 2019

#### Problem Statement 
As a Veteran or active duty service member, I want to learn about education programs and compare benefits by school. I want to be able to easily research colleges and employers approved for the GI Bill. I’d like to receive an estimate of my GI Bill benefits, as well as information about the facility’s value and affordability, so I can make an informed decision. 

#### Solution Hypothesis
By presenting current eligibility information and housing rates, displaying information that relates to the Veteran's specific situation, and presenting contextual help to guide the Veteran through the process of using the tool, VA.gov will simplify and improve the process of researching GI Bill benefits. 
Increasing Veterans’ satisfaction with the process will allow them to feel more confident in their ability to compare and understand their GI Bill benefits.

#### Research Questions

The research is designed to answer the following questions:
 
*	Do Veterans understand how to engage with the tool to see relevant GI Bill benefit information?
*	What challenges or common pitfalls do Veterans face when attempting to compare GI bill benefits by school and learn about education programs?
*	Are Veterans able to use the tool to compare benefits easily? 
*	Where can we use conditional logic and branching to display only those questions that are relevant to the Veteran?
*	Are there opportunities to streamline the form by pre-populating data from other sources?
*	What additional information or contextual help would ensure that users provide the correct inputs and are able to leverage the tool’s full capabilities?
*	What aspects of the GIBCT Calculator could be improved to enhance user understanding?

#### What knowledge will make us feel like the research process has been successful?

Developing a thorough understanding of how Veterans use the Comparison Tool and validating design solutions in the prototype to address issues uncovered during discovery activities will show our research process has been successful. 

#### What kinds of users do we need to talk to answer our questions?

The following users have been identified:
*	Veterans
*	Active duty service members
*	National Guard/Reservists 
* Dependents
*	VA Education Stakeholder
*	Military & Veterans’ Services Specialist at educational institutions

#### What specific questions do we need to ask on our Usability Testing screener to get the right kinds of users to test the form?

In addition to the standard questions, which ensure a representative mix of participants, the screener should include the following questions and responses:
1.  Are you interested in or planning to use your GI Bill benefits in the next 1-3 years? 
    * If yes, to Question 2
    * If no, thank caller, end
2.  Have you decided what institution you’d like to attend yet?
    * If no, schedule participant
    * If yes, thank caller, end
    

#### What kind of user research do we want to conduct?

The following research methods will be used:

Research Phase 1

Bi-weekly Requirements Sessions 
* VA Education Stakeholders

Interview and live site walk-through with:
*	2 Military & Veterans’ Services Specialists and/or VSOs (BAH will recruit)

Remoted Moderated Usability Testing of the live site and a conceptual prototype with:
*	2 Veterans 
*	2 Service members
*	2 National Guard/Reservists 
* 2 Dependents

Research Phase 2

Remote Moderated Usability Testing of a revised high-fidelity prototype with:
*	2 Military & Veterans’ Services Specialists and/or VSOs (BAH will recruit)
*	2 Veterans 
*	2 Active duty service members 
*	2 National Guard/Reservists
* 2 Dependents

If applicable to scope and available, the following may be reviewed:
* Review Google Analytics to measure performance and user progress through the service
* Review site performance data
* Review user feedback collected from the Contact Center


#### What testing and recording tools do we need to run the research sessions?

Remote Interviews will be recorded via WebEx
Usability test sessions will be recorded via WebEx
In-person notes will be taken by hand and/or on a computer. 

#### What artifacts do we need to support the research effort?

For Research Phase 1 Interviews with Veteran Service Specialists, the following artifacts will be developed:
*	Military & Veterans’ Services Specialists Questionnaire 

The questionnaire will be ready by: 4/7/2019

For Research Phase 1 testing with Veterans, the following artifacts will be developed:
*	Veteran Usability Testing Script
* Conceptual Prototype

The test script and conceptual prototype will be ready by: 4/10/2019

For Research Phase 2, the following artifacts will be developed:
*	A revised high-fidelity, clickable InVision prototype
*	Veteran Test Script

The InVision prototype will be ready by: Date TBD

The Test scripts will be ready by: Date TBD
