# GIBCT Colmery Act Veteran Discussion Script
*April 11, 2019*

### Welcome and Opening Remarks (5 minutes)
*[When the participant is ready, the moderator will begin the session with the following introduction.]*

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [name], and I also have two colleagues on the line, Amy and Cindy.  They are observing and taking notes. We work with a team at the VA that is enhancing a website called VA.gov and we're interested in speaking with you today about the Education section of the website. 

We’d like your thoughts on what aspects of the pages work well and where we might make improvements to make things even easier for Veterans.

Before we start, I’d like to mention a few logistical details:

*  We are interested in hearing your honest opinions. We are in no way testing your knowledge or ability. Our goal is to be sure that application meets Veterans’ needs, so we are interested in hearing your thoughts and ideas. You are welcome to express any opinions you wish. We welcome your feedback.
*  If for any reason you want to pause or stop the session at any time, just let me know. I'd be happy to do so.
*  By testing the site thoroughly, we hope to ensure that it’s written in a thoughtful way and gives Veterans all of the information they need to make informed decisions.
*  Do you have any questions so far? 
*  Lastly, we generally record sessions, in case we need to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. 

Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today? 

Great! I'm going to turn on screen and audio recording now.  Once it's on, I'll ask again, as we like to have your verbal consent

[The meeting host will begin audio and screen recording.]

Are you comfortable if we record the audio and screen movements today? 

### Warm-up Questions (5 minutes)
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.  

1. Are you interested in using VA Education benefits in the future? 
2. What factors are most important to you as you look as schools?
3. Do you happen to know which Education benefits are you eligible for?
4. Would you expect the VA website to offer any resources to help you decide which school to attend? If so, what type of resources would you find helpful?
5. Have you used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before? If yes, what was your experience?
6. What would you hope to learn by using a GI Bill Comparison Tool?
7. What factors are most important to you as you compare schools or institutions?


Okay, now we're going to look at the va.gov website and walk through a few scenarios.

#### Think Aloud
While you are going through the site, we ask that you please think aloud and vocalize your thoughts and decisions. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn.  We are interested in your first reaction to each page, as well as what you are thinking as you engage with each page.   If you have questions about what information needs to go in a particular field, it’s likely that many other Veterans will too. This may seem strange at first, but it helps us understand what you are thinking and helps us so much with our work.


### Scenario #1 (10 minutes)
Do you have a dream school?  Using the GI Bill Comparison Tool, how would you find out what benefits you would receive at that school?

Please talk aloud and let us know what you are thinking as you explore the site.

*[After the particpant has explored the site and shared thoughts aloud.]*

1. What are your first impressions?  
2. What information on these pages is the most important to you?
3. What is confusing or unclear? Why?  	
4. How trustworthy and reliable do you consider this information to be?



### Scenario #2 (10 minutes)

Let say you signed up for the GI Bill last April so you could take a couple of classes at your local community college.  After taking the classes, you decided that you'd like to get a degree in engineering.  The two schools you are considering are University of Florida and Florida State.  You'd like to maximize your benefits. Using the site, how would you decide which school offers you the greatest benefits?

*[After the particpant has explored the prototype and shared thoughts aloud.]*

### Section 501 Follow up questions 

1. What are your thoughts on the contents of the gray box on the right?
2. What are your thoughts on receiving an estimate vs. an exact amount for your housing allowance?
3. If logging in would give you a more precise estimate, would you take the time to do so, or is the estimate sufficient?
4. What are your thoughts on the questions on the left? How they might be useful? 
5. What are your thought on the 2nd to last question on the left ("Did you use your Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit before January 1, 2018?")?
	
### Section 107 Follow up questions

1. If you chose a large state school with campuses in multiple cities, would you expect the housing allowance to be the same or different for each campus?
2. How would you decide which campus you'd like to attend?
3. What are your thoughts on the last question on the left ("Will the majority of your classes be on the main campus?")?
4. Let's look at the results page for a moment.  As you think about large schools like the University of California, would you expect to see a card for each University or one for each branch of a university?


### Scenario #3 (2 minutes)

[If the participant is eligible for multiple GI Bills] 
How would you use the Comparison tool to determine which GI Bill to apply for?  

### Follow up questions

1. What are your thoughts on the process of comparing GI Bill?  
2. What was easy and did you find challenging?
3. What would make the process of comparing GI Bills easier?


### Post-Task Interview (5 minutes)
Now that you’ve had a chance to explore the site, I’m going to ask you a few final questions. Some of these questions I’ve already asked you, but I want to ask them again, now that you’ve seen the website.  

*  What do you like most about this website? 
*  What enhancements or features would you recommend to improve the overall usefulness of this site? 
*  Would you use this website in real life? Why or why not?
*  Would you recommend this tool to your friends? Why or why not?
*  On a scale of 1-5 with 5 being the highest, how would you rate the tool's ability to give you the information you need to make a decision on which school to attend based on the benefits you'll receive?
*  On a scale of 1-5 with 5 being the highest, how likely are you to use a tool like this?
*  Assuming you had access to all three, would you prefer to view a site like the comparison tool using a desktop, tablet or mobile? 
*  Do you have any additional thoughts or comments you'd like to share?


### Thank-You and Closing
*[The moderator concludes each session by thanking the participant for their time and for offering his/her opinions and suggestions.]*

Thank you very much for taking the time to give us your feedback today. We really appreciate your help!
