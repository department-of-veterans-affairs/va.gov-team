## GI Bill Comparison Tool Non-Veteran Discovery Interview Preliminary Findings

The following preliminary findings for the GI Bill Comparison Tool were gathered during Discovery Interviews with School Certifiying Officials that were held April 8-9, 2019. Participants included 4 School Certifying Officials from institutions in CA, FL, MD, and AZ.

#### Sec 107 Zip Code
* School Certifying Officials (SCOs) do not differentiate between main campus, branches and extensions.  Having a profile page for each would be useful
* Overseas Students can enter 99999 to obtain the overseas rate for schools (Investigate further to understand if UI adjustments are needed)
* Seeing the BAH for all branches on one page would be helpful

#### Section 501 DOD or VA Rate for BAH
* Like that it allows students to see what their housing allowance is in a different location
* FSU's housing rate does not match the DOD site

#### Yellow Ribbon
* Veterans have misconceptions about the Yellow Ribbon program.  They assume it's a supplemental scholarship.  It's only relevant for private institutions and out of state waivers.

#### Basic Housing Allowance/Profile Page
* BAH is among the top 3-4 questions veterans ask
* Students are most interested in the housing allowance rate as they use the Comparison Tool.
* BAH works well and is useful to Veterans
* A lot of veterans are looking to optimize their BAH rather than necessarily choosing the right school for them.
* Many students make decisions based on BAH
* Some use the site to figure out which benefit to use, however the percentage is dropping.
* Evaluating the total cost is the most effective use of the tool

#### Data Accuracy
* Having no data would be better than having inaccurate data.  This has been brought to the attention of lawmakers in DC
* Data is skewed because students start at Community colleges and finish at other schools.  Neither school gets credit for the graduation
* Some SCOs tell Veterans to se the CT with caution as there is invalid information
* Would be good to see how many Veterans are certified in a year and how many graduate each year
* Several Veteran Organizations have mentioned that it could be done better.
* For school 1
    * The Estimate rate per term for tuition for school 1 equates to 13.1 hrs and does not make sense
    * Priority enrollment is missing
    * Yellow Ribbon is missing
    * Principles of excellence is missing
    * "The graduation rate is grossly inaccurate." (Shows 0% while 86% actually graduate)
    * Data looks bleak
* For school 2
    * Grad rates pretty close
* For school 3
    * Guesses that data is pretty close, but this is the first year they've entered data and he admitted that he's not the best person to ask.
    * Believe admins pull data from the site

#### Compare Different Schools Simultaneously
* Having the ability to pick several schools and compare them side-by-side would be helpful

#### Compare Branches of a single school simultaneously
* Would like all cards for a school to appear adjacent to others on the Search Results page (Some of the newer schools do not appear)
* Provide access to other branches on the profile page

#### Military Connected Community
* Would be nice to illustrate each school's military community by showing a break down of the population -- Veterans, Active Duty, Guard/Reserves, Spouses, Dependents, ROTC.
* The average age of military connected students is going down as more dependents use benefits
* Parents of dependents like to see that there is a readily available community as they transition - make it a lot more apparent  
*  School 3 had 700-900 that receive Veteran benefits.  If Active duty students are include, the number is even higher.

#### Total Cost of Education
* Gives a pretty good representation of out of pocket costs, especially for state schools.
* Out of State fees are a significant factor, incorporating them in the out of pocket cost area would be helpful (important as the number of students choosing out of state schools is increasing)
* Provide access to external links that can provide data for actual housing costs, which may differ from the BAH amount.

#### Point of Contacts
* Provide contact information for POCs.  This information is available in WEAMS

#### Usability
* Improve the usability of the site as the average age of students is going down and expectations of usability are going up.

#### Map of Campus Locations
* Having a map of campus locations would be helpful, especially in big metropolitan areas where traffic is a major concern.

#### External Links
* Consider displaying external links to helpful resources (Low priority as school websites may be a better location for such links)

#### Rate of Pursuit Calculator
* The rate of pursuit calculator in spreadsheet format was helpful. Is it already on the site?
	
#### Complaints
* Would be nice to see the content of the complaints so we can address issues

#### List of Majors
* Displaying the top 5 majors would be useful
* Would be great to display a list of all Certified, Pending and Unapproved programs - Data exists in WEAMS and is accurate,

#### WEAMS
* A lot of effort is needed to ensure that the WEAMS data is up-to-date.  As the data goes through many hands, it's not uncommon to find mis-spellings, and other inaccuracies, especially for schools with 800 programs.

#### Deciding between GI Bills
* Some students use the tool to figure out which benefit to use (Montgomery or Post 9/11).

#### What works well
* "It's already such a great tool, it's really life changing to be able to refer people to it."
* "Generally pretty easy for people to use and helpful for students to understand where theyâ€™re going to get the most of their VA benefit."
* "How much housing allow am I getting? What type of learning is offered? Online only , face to face, etc.. Easy to see what they'll get if they are face to face" 

#### Follow-up Questions for Veterans
* Would you prefer 1 card or many for large schools with multiple campuses?

#### UI Considerations
* How to address display of BAH Based on 99999 ZIP Code for overseas schools
