# COMPARISON TOOL SEC 107 UPDATE #
This content appears as “Learn more” text along with the question that asks where a Veteran will be taking the majority of classes and includes a Zip code field. 
 
## Final Recommendation, Approved by Edu and DSVA 6/28 ##

### Location where you'll take classes ###

VA pays monthly housing allowance (MHA) based on the campus location **where you physically attend the majority of your classes**.

A campus could include:
* **A main campus**: the location where the *primary teaching facilities* of an educational institution are located
* **A branch campus**: the location of an educational institution that is *geographically apart* from and *operationally independent* of the main campus of the educational institution
* **An extension campus**: the location that is *geographically apart* from the main or branch campus but is *operationally dependent* on that campus for the performance of administrative tasks

## Parenthetical notes for implementation ##

By clicking on the "Location-Based Housing Allowance" link, it takes you to an anchor on an existing page, where the rate-explainer copy (below) should exist or be added. Here’s the recommended page to add this content to; it should be added after How can I use my Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits section: https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/

Here is another page where that content could be added and linked to within the Monthly Housing Allowance section:
 https://www.benefits.va.gov/GIBILL/resources/benefits_resources/rates/ch33/ch33rates080119.asp.

Note, the recommendation is that this content is added on BOTH pages consistently.)

### What is the Location-Based Housing Allowance (Section 107)? ###

Previously, GI Bill beneficiaries were paid Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA) based on the main or branch campus of the school they were enrolled. If a student attended classes at more than one location, they were paid the rate that was most advantageous.

Now, the MHA is based on the campus location **where the student physically attends the majority of his or her classes**.

The VA defines a campus as one of the following:

* **Main campus**: A location where the *primary teaching facilities* of an educational institution are located.
* **Branch campus**: A location of an educational institution that is *geographically apart* from and *operationally independent* of the main campus of the educational institution
* **Extension campus**: A location that is *geographically apart* from the main or branch campus but is *operationally dependent* on that campus for the performance of administrative tasks.
