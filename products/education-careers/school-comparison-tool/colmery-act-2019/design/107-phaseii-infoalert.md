### Attending classes at an extension campus? ###

Under the Forever GI Bill, the Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA) is calculated based on the campus location where you physically attend the majority of your classes.

To estimate your MHA benefit, you can go to a school or employer's profile page in the GI Bill Comparison Tool and answer the question "Where will you take the majority of your classes?"

To learn more about the Location-Based Housing Allowance, [visit the Post-9/11 GI Bill website](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/#location-based107).
