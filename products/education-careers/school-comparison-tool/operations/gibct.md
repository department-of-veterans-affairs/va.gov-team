# Vets.gov Product Specific Operations and Maintenance Plan

Vets.gov maintains the GI Bill Comparison Tool (GIBCT). GIBCT does not maintain formal support relationships with any other VA systems. If it creates those in the future, they will be documented here.

When a Veteran or Institution (University, Trade School, etc.) reports an issue about GIBCT it will be received by HRC and subsequently routed to the Vets.gov on-call team for that day. If the reported issue involves Vets.gov code the primary on-call individual will fix the issue or direct the issue to the respective team. If the GIBCT issue reported does not involve Vets.gov code the on-call team should forward the issue/Veteran to 224A.VBACO@va.gov and capture the following set of information to assist the GIBCT team is solving the issue:

### Veteran
1. Veteran's Full Name
2. Email Address
3. Phone Number
4. What benefit is the Veteran inquiring about (Chapter 33, tuition assistance, etc.)

###  Institution

1. Full Name of Institution Representative
2. Official Title
3. Name of Institution
4. Email Address

All Veteran-reported issues reported on GIBCT will handled using the standard procedures and call flows documented in the main Operations and Maintenance plan. Once the incident is resolved in the issue tracking software, the contact center will be notified and can contact the Veteran to notify them of the resolution.

## VA Stakeholder inputs
VA Employees will utilize the standard vets.gov contact center process staffed by the Health Resource Center (HRC). HRC will provide "help desk" reporting for VA employee on vets.gov and report those issues to vets.gov using the standard processes for handling user reported issues.

If a VA employee reports a break/fix or administrative request through a separate channel (email, GitHub), they should be directed to lodge the request through the help desk so that the request can be tracked and managed most efficiently by our team.
