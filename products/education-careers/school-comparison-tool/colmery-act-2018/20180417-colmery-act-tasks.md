# GIBCT tasks

[As a Veteran eligible for “Yellow Ribbon” status, I need the estimator tool to display the actual rate.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/9365) - #9365

- [x] New Yellow Ribbon section in the school profile that shows:
  - Maximum scholarship amount
  - \# of scholarships available
  - Which programs (less important)
  - Should be close to the YR calculator field so user can fill in details there
- [x] Remove link to YR rates in vet programs section

[As a user, I need a Tool Tip to explain the basic allowance for housing (BAH) changes made by the Colmery Act.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/9367) - #9367

- Need from Edu team:
  - Content explaining BAH changes for those starting Jan 1 2018
- The policy change:
  - Those who start using GI Bill on or after Jan 1 2018 get a reduced rate; those who started using it before get the old, higher rate
  - What do we show in the calculator since we don't ask if they were enrolled prior to Jan 1?
  - Difference between 2017 vs. 2018 rates is anywhere from an increase of of \$246 to a decrease of \$429/mo. Most areas with a decrease can expect to get $50-100 less per month
  - The MHA payments you receive for the Post-9/11 GI Bill are based on the military's Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) rates for an E-5 with dependents
- [x] Determine which rate to show
  - Ideal option: 
    - Ask an aditional question "have you used the GI Bill prior to Jan 1 2018?" (defaulted to no) to determine which rate to show
    - Link to modal explaining rate changes
  - Alternate options:
    - Show the 2018 rates only
    - Show a range w/ link to modal explaining the 2018 rate changes

  - Content to help them determine what "majority" means in this case
- [x] Calculator
  - (toward the top) ask a question like "will you be attending the campus for your studies for the majority of the academic year?"
  - If no: show zip code field
  - Need to think through how to explain "majority" in a simple way
