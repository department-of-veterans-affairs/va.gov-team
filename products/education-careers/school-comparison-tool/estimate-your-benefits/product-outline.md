## Overview
*After you've explored the problem and through testing / hypothesis have identified the ideal solution, write up one sentence describing the solution you'll be creating.*

## Problem Statement
GIBCT users who are estimating benefits, especially those with accessibility challenges or those on mobile devices, may not detect the changes they’re making to the estimated benefits on Profile Pages because those changes could be happening outside their field of view.   

How might we create an improved user experience for GIBCT users, particularly those with accessibility concerns or on mobile devices, that ensures they can accurately detect changes they’ve made to their estimated benefits on profile pages?

 
## Desired User Outcomes

- *Why would a user want to use this?*
- *With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

-	508 compliant
-	Easily view changes to estimated benefits in GIBCT profile page
-	Not impeded by screen or device sizes
-	More engagement with GIBCT calculator controls 
-	More correlation between making changes and displayed results 
-	Able to adjust the calculator fields without confusion as to where the changes are reflected
-	Better awareness of which controls influence the changes in estimated benefits
-	Users may become aware of additional sources of funding that they hadn’t previously considered


## Undesired User Outcomes

-	Impeded from viewing estimated benefits
-	Users may focus more on the benefit than the quality of education
-	Users may be distracted by benefits estimator
-	Users may see high estimates and feel bad that they’re not getting as much at their school
-	Users will expect similar improved accessibility in other parts of the GIBCT
-	Users may expect changes to benefits estimator to happen as they’re making adjustments, in the manner the tool operates now.  
-	Users who are familiar with how the tool operates now may wonder if it’s malfunctioning when changes to estimated benefits don’t happen simultaneously with their modifications 


## Desired Business Outcomes

- *Why would your business want this to exist?*
- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

-	Addresses critical user need to provide accurate estimates of benefits regardless of users’ accessibility concerns or device use
-	VA needs to comply with Sec. 508
-	Fewer requests to VA for benefits estimation – frees up call center resources
-	Fewer requests to schools for benefits estimation – frees up local school resources to provide additional support to Veteran students
-	Continued modernization of the GIBCT, an important resource for VA Education Service, reflects well on the VA and their reputation 
-	*COME BACK TO THIS: Any legislated changes to how education benefits are calculated can be made in a timely manner* 


## Undesired Business Outcomes

-	Could make it more confusing for users without accessibility issues
-	Less use of the tool due to user dissatisfaction
-	Lost opportunities to provide direct counseling to prospective students may result in less informed users
-	Updates to estimated benefits may cause unanticipated changes in other parts of the tool


## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumtion w/your initial set of functionality*

- Users will understand how to calculate their benefits with the updated UI
- #### Our solution will be an improvement over what exists currently. Tool will work better for most people – not degrade the current experience ####
- All accessibility concerns will be addressed
- The data that is being controlled and displayed won’t change.  The questions and UI are the focus of this effort. 
- Any legislated changes regarding how education benefits are calculated are excluded from this scope of work.  
- Work will be performed on the GIBCT profile page, does not include search results page. 
- Work will be focused primarily on the Estimate Your Benefits accordion, may include Program Selection accordion in VET TEC profile pages. 


## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*

Improved UI to address accessibility concerns with explicit Estimate Your Benefits controls which change displayed benefit values.

Starting there based on 508 accessibility feedback from VSP. 

- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*

We decided to do this over leaving as-is because we don’t want to leave out individuals with accessibility issues. 

- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*

Cannot redesign the full GIBCT due to project scope. 

Cannot include Search Results Page in this effort due to project scope. 

- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

We’ll be prepared to iterate on the solution based on usability testing and user input. 

## KPIs
- *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
--- 

-	Analytics to evaluate GIBCT overall usage – does not decrease
-	Analytics to track calculator-button clicks - ??
-	Call Center calls – potential for decreased calls about how to use the GIBCT profile benefits estimator (need to determine if this is tracked & establish baseline before formalizing) 
-	Potential for ForeSee integration (not there currently, no baseline to measure satisfaction up or down)


## Go-to-market Strategy
- *How are Veterans and others using this product going to know it exists?*
- *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful?*

- VA should alert Veterans, other users, and institutions listed in GIBCT & SCOs that work at those institutions.
- Communications via VA.gov, Email, social media.


## Target Launch Date
- *What is your target launch date of your MVP/iteration?*

NLT June 19, 2020

- *What is your date for when you'll evaluate impact after launch?*

Ideally, July 20, 2020
