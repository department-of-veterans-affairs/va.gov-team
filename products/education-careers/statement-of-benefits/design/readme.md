# Reducing Errors on the Post-911 GI Bill Statement of Benefits

In an attempt to reduce errors on this page, the team proposed adding a troubleshooting wizard to give Veterans an idea of why their benefits were not showing up.

## Current planned flow

## Proposed Visual Styling
This is an example of how the wizard might work, delivering custom alert messages based on the user's responses to the wizard questions.

**Note**: The styling for alerts overall has changed. The suggestion here is to use the yellow warning style.
