## Story

- This person used the benefit 5 years ago.
- He attended a 2-year college then transferred to get his bachelors.
- Surgeries related to his disability delayed his schooling.
- His benefit ran out before he could graduate. (months lapsed)

## Communication

There is a VA representative at every university that deals with the GI Bill.

You have to give this person your COE. Maybe emailing it to this person would be helpful if secure.

## Technology

MO cautioned us about new technology and the promises of syncing information across the VA + creating new accounts for websites. 

MO said registration can be a barrier. He registered to get into a new portal with his login card. This assured him the login was secure. He questioned the safety of his information without the PIV login. They said it was safe and secure. MO updated his address in this system. However, this information was not passed to the VA.  

VA only communicates via US mail. So, when his address wasn't updated, this resulted in him missing important mail about money he owed the VA. 

## My Questions

GI Bill covers tuition at the school + get stipend. You get enough months to equal 120 credits or 4 years of college. What is the translation of months -- how many credits do I need to take a month?

Why is the GI Bill based on time and not credit. 

GI Bill can be used for vocational or college. 

Enrollment History on UI: information is hours -- should be same data as what is above in "entitlement" or what you qualify. 

This many months of eligibility, I have this many credits now, help me understand how to project the rest of my education?

Vocational will be checked on months. College tracks on semester. 

How many people do vocational, university and how many people both? 

HMW help Mike better plan his progress so he graduates before his monthâ€™s run out?

What is all of the criteria? [Look here](http://inquiry.vba.va.gov/weamspub/buildSearchInstitutionCriteria.do;jsessionid=qtMbSxQFpzyL7GpnQrtnNGv6G9CGQQvb2YqM9Cvw3vB2pv2lXhfJ!-1531379871)
