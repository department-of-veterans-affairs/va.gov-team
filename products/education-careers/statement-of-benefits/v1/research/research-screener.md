# Recruiting Checklist

## Step 1: Define Your User
Assigned: Laura

It is important to be selective when looking for research participants. Finding people that are real users will get you better data to work with and you'll waste less time.

To start this process, you can define a set of user perspectives you need to get. Think of this as your "[circle of extremes](http://www.designkit.org/methods/45)." 

User Extremes:

Veterans currently using the Post 9/11 GI Bill or Chapter 33. 
Veterans that used the Post 9/11 GI Bill or Chapter 33 in the past. 
Veterans that have never used the Post 9/11 GI Bill or Chapter 33 but are considering using it in the future. 

User Extremes to Avoid: 

People that used or are using an education benefit that is not the Post 9/11 GI Bill, such as the Montgomery GI Bill or Chapter 30. 
People that help Veterans use the Post 9/11 GI Bill but are not eligible to use it themselves. 

## Step 2: Write Screener 
Assigned: Laura

The screener should help you find the right people for your study. The screener should include these elements:

- Intro:

- Times they can attend with 2-hour slots defined. Example: 9 a.m. ET to 11 a.m. ET

- Questions that help you narrow your users to match your study, users you want to talk to and users you should avoid.
   - Are you currently enrolled in training eligible for Post 9/11 GI Bill Chapter 33 benefit compensation?
      - Yes: How often do you go online to find information about your Post 9/11 GI Bill enrollment?
      - No: Are you eligible to use the Post 9/11 GI Bill Chapter 33 benefit? When do you plan to start using it?


## Step 3: Create Schedule, Confirm Testers
Assigned: Kristin

The schedule should be accessbile to everyone and created in such a way that allows you to monitor when you have found someone that maps to your circle of extremes and slotted into an available time slot. 

Variables on a schedule include:

- Time Slot
- Type of Extreme
- Email
- Session Link
