## Post-9/11 Stakeholders Sync

## Context
* for pre-9/11, people with Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill) benefits can see enrollments/hours; dates of window in which you have to use benefits; entitlements
* WAVE (W? Automated Verification of Enrollment) is the monthly attendance verification system -- under Ch. 30 students had to verify their attendance on a monthly basis. In place to prevent overpayment.
* Chapter 33 (Post 9/11 GI Bill) needed a long-term solution to provide same service
* LTS - "long term solution"
  * where all Chapter 33 benefits are processed (eligibility, benefits enrollment, service/tour-of-duty info, school enrollment info)

### Users

Who is the primary user of this page? Who are the secondary users?

* Anyone using Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. 
* They can use this information to see how much they have left of their benefit, for purposes of planning or going back to school.
* e.g. a user goes off to work for a few years and decides to go back to school; can log in to see what benefits they are still entitled to
* also helps user know what they (vs. VA) will need to pay for


### COE
* One of the most frequent requests to the contact center is "can I get a copy of my COE?"
* Needed by school verification officer to know what amount VA will pay
* Even though the beneficiary can print off (or show) the status page in lieu of the COE, often times the individual AND THE SCHOOL want the actual letter. Sometimes the school will insist on the COE, even if the eBenefits page is better, more up to date data. 
* The COE never expires, and you get it when the benefit is issued -- it doesn't update even though the data that backs it does.
* Status page is actually more accurate/current than COE

### Enrollment History 

What is included in enrollment history? Why are some things not included?

* Type of change/date effective is when a student adds or drops a class in a given period -- the school has to report that to VA.
* They categorize schools. The majority are "institutes of higher learning." That's what most of the students are enrolled in. There are non-college degree courses, like HVAC training. 
* Very few people take correspondence training -- different from distance learning. Still approved for VA funds but rarely used.
* Flight training, OJT, apprenticeship, correspondence is processed in different systems -- not LTS, so that's why those types are not available in this interface.
* It's less than 20% of users who are doing ^^. Certain schools are approved that are just flight schools. If they're in that type of training, they can get _entitlement_ information, just not _enrollment history_ (i.e., dates of attendance).


### Opportunities

What do you see as the biggest opportunities to improve this page?

* "I can understand how that date would be nice for school certifying officials." (re: including something like "Information current as of <date>")
* In WAVE, there's a "remaining as of" because it's always as of the last date of the enrollment period. 
* "I don't see a lot of ways to make it better; I would like to see it more utilized." -- particularly in terms of gettin schools to accept a status page screenshot
* The status page clearly states that it's equivalent to the COE, but that doesn't appear to convince some certifying officials
  * in the plast, have tried to get eBenefits to make it possible to print the COE letter from here, but did not pan out
  * no official link exists at the VA where it is explained that these 2 things are equivalent and the screenshot is acceptable

### Risks

What should we know about the risks of changing this page?

* Your "delimiting date" can change -- it's based on the date you're released from active duty, so if you go back on active duty that date will change. All award letters, etc use that terminology.
  * Gloassary is meant to help with that, but open to suggestions for making it more clear
