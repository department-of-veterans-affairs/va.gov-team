### Welcome and Opening Remarks

Thank you for joining us today. My name is [NAME] and we also have [NAME OF OTHERS OBSERVING] observing and taking notes for this session. Today we are hoping to learn more about your process for finding and using your education benefits.

In this session, I’ll ask you to tell me about your experiences and it’ll feel like you are talking a lot. That is good! Today is all about you and the more we learn about your experiences, the better. There are no right or wrong answers.

Some quick admin notes: 

  * This entire feedback session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question or task.
  * We’ll be recording the screen activities as we look at the site. Recording our discussion today will help us capture everything you say accurately.
  * If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
