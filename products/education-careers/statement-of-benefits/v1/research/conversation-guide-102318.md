## Intro (2 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Katelyn. I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes.
Today we're going to talk about viewing your statement of benefits for the Post-911 GI Bill.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about xx minutes.**
I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**
If you've had a frustrating experience or find something we show you to be confusing, we want to hear about it. Your honest insights help us to figure out how we can improve the veteran experience, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express.
- **In this session, we will be looking at a prototype.**
This means that we are looking at something that looks like a real website, but it functions a bit differently.
For example, some links will work while other links won't.
This is for the purpose of testing so we can focus on observing specific tasks.
Do you have any questions about this or what a prototype is? 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start recording.*

## Warm-up Questions (x minutes)

1. Before we start, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work).
2. Do you have a Vets.gov account? If so, about how often do you use the website?
