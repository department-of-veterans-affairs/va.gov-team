How does a person land on this page?
- Do veterans typically log in, then get redirected to dashboard? Other option is the authenticated homepage.

Yellow Ribbon:  The Yellow Ribbon GI Education Enhancement Program (Yellow Ribbon Program or YRP) allows institutions of higher learning in the United States to voluntarily enter into an annual agreement with VA to fund tuition expenses that exceed the highest public in-state undergraduate tuition rate. The institution can contribute up to 50% of those expenses and VA will match the same amount as the institution. The Yellow Ribbon Program is a provision of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008. If a Yellow Ribbon appears next to the enrollment dates, your school contributed Yellow Ribbon funds for this term. See more information about the program.
