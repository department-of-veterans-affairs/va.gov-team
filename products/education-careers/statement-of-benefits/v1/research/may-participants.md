## What We Shouldn't Forget

- Top learnings/surprises	
   - Teresa negotiated her Enlistment Contract so that she could get the right about of education benefits to get a civilian career after the Army. 
   - She joined to go to college so that she could get the training she needed to be either a broadcast journalist or linguist. "Not into blood." At the time, in the 80's, a 4-year degree was how you did this. "Be all you can be."
   - Today, "Career Technical Education" is the focus. The Army helps you "learn what you need to learn to do your job." "That's cool." Today, training is what you need. 
   - Her post-Army goal was to get a bachelor's degree because that is what you did in the 80's and she wanted to get it in as little amount of time as possible. The primary decision point for her was how "receptive" a university was, or rather, how many credits they gave her for her coursework during the military. Also, they must offer her the degree she wanted.
   - She used her leftover "resources," or money, to go to graduate school. This seemed more like a bonus but she wanted to use every drop of her benefit. 
   - If you are "entitled" the university sees you as a pain. Entitled because you are a vet, but maybe compensation or financial aid would translate better in this environment. 
   
    - Privilege is real — she kept mentioning how she was able to grease the system because she was smart, connected, etc
    - She joined up specifically to go to college, and so knew about the GI Bill and edu benefits before even signing her contract — how does that differ from people joining up 10+ years later?
   
- Main takeaway	
- Other people we should interview
   - Dana from her nonprofit.

### Teresa

**Experience**

- Became a broadcast journalist in the Army — joined knowing that the GI Bill was the most important reason she was joining the military. 

* Describe your process for [deciding, applying and using] this benefit? When did you have to share your certificate of eligibility? How did you get it?
    - “The Army in particular has always done a good job on the radio and tv saying ‘this is a method to go to college.’…recruiters came to my school, there was commercials. Be all you can be! I always knew that was a way that you could pay for college.”
    - “They spend gazillions of dollars to do it…they know what attracts kids to them; they’re not stupid!”
    
* Were you always interested in [education path]? What did you want to do before? 
     - Because she had a good GPA and a good GT score, “I really could have done pretty much what I wanted in the Army. They gave me several options, but I wasn’t interested in anything medical…I don’t like blood, bleh! I knew I wanted to do something that would translate to a civilian career…I didn’t want to be in the army for 100 years….I was presented with broadcast journalism and linguists.”
     - Linguist would have sent her to California, which was exciting, but she got sent instead to her hometown! Defense Information School was fantastic. “I learned more in the three months I was there…than the four years I went to college for. It was joint service…fantastic.”

**Language**

   -  “I don’t think military training would ever be accused of being well-rounded — you’re being trained for a job. That’s cool, that’s what it is.”

* Were there any options you knew right away were not a good fit? Why?

    - “I knew that I definitely wanted something that would translate into a career…so my father was drafted in the Army in Vietnam…mortar maggot, but that doesn’t really translate to a career feel once you get out.”
    - “I knew that I wanted a job that was going to be minimal transition. I knew I might need a college education. What people in the military struggle with sometimes is that civilian folks don’t know what the job is, so they make you start over and feel like you don’t have any experience when you do.”
    - “I had a great recruiter…and I had an uncle who was in the Army too…I went in a little more of an educated consumer, and I had great scores. I was almost a dream recruit….I made their numbers look good that month, so they wanted to help me and help me get what I wanted. And I was smart enough to know that if I don’t get what I want, I’m not going to sign. And some kids don’t have that option.”
    - There were pamphlets explaining Montgomery GI Bill, what will it cost me (had to pay into it). Exited with $25K, which was enough to graduate with a bachelor’s without taking out loans. Had done some classes in the Army when it was offered. 
    - One of the reasons she chose her university was that they were super friendly to her military schooling — they helped her translate journalism schooling into college credits. Indiana University.
    - Filled out a normal application (to IU). Called somebody in the registrar’s office and said “I have a GI Bill, Army College Fund, these transcripts, I need help figuring out what I have to take to get out of here [in the shortest amount of time].” Was 26, not interested in “hanging out and being a sorority girl….I wanted the piece of paper and out, thanksverymuch.” Did it in 2.5 years and went through the summers — had the money to do it, didn’t have to work full-time. 
     - “The military took all those barriers away from me, because I had the cash.”
     
* What were the different milestones you knew you had to pass along the way?
    
     - To finish her college degree. “At the time I believed that a four-year college degree was the absolute door-opening piece of paper that I needed. Now I would tell you that training in some sort is your door opener…to financial success, homeownership, whatever you want, without a four-year degree. But in the 80s, [you were told you needed a college education.]”
     - You had to be smart with your dollars and take the classes they would give you. Did a lot of things to get as much college credit in the military as possible. Those were also promotion points to get to the next pay grades. 
     - The Army has an education department/center for tracking goals & progress. Took classes through a variety of institutions that were available on post.
     - When you separate, the edu center works with your new college. “Honestly, that process was pretty easy for me.”

* Re: x amount of dollars, how did you know how much you had?
      - Knew from her enlistment contract, because that’s what she enlisted for. “You will pay $1200, and…when you complete four years of service and have honorable discharge and do everything you’er supposed to do, then this is what we’ll give you. And then I worked with my university, there’s a VA liaison at every college in this country, and they want your money, so they’ll help you quite well figuring out how to access those benefits.”
      - They take the amount of money that you have (when she was in school), you get a monthly stipend based on the credit-hours you’re taking. “I actually had money left over in my GI Bill account when I graduated, so I actually went to grad school — you had to use it within a 10-year time span — and I actually used the last bit of my GI Bill and Army College Fund in grad school. If I was enrolled, it sent me a stipend until it ran out. And it was a lot! $700 - $800 a month. I lived in an apartment and had a roommate and worked part time. I didn’t have to bust my hiney to get this education, which was a clear advantage…”
      
* What’s one thing that would have helped you in this process? 
     - “I think it’s hard for — and I”m sure the military has gotten better — I just think it was hard for them at the time to help people transition out…we were encouraged to get out [during the Clinton era] and there wasn’t a lot of support in that transition process. I was a journalist, I had more resources, I was able to ask a lot of questions and dig into some stuff that maybe other people weren’t. But I don’t think the process of transitioning out of the Army and [accessing] services was very clear. There’s just so much conflicting information [among websites]. There’s no clear, good portal that says [bangs on table] this is what you do.”
     
* What was unclear?
    - What exactly was required. The university said you need x, y, z, education person in the Army said something different. What paperwork is required, what forms. “What exactly do you need to get in order to collect your benefit….there needs to be a book, and every university needs to follow the same process…it’s a government process, everybody should be following the same process to get those dollars. It shouldn’t be that hard. And one place for students to go and find that information!” Because they might apply to [a few] universities before they pick one — what’s good enough for one university should be good enough for all of them.

* Why did you put entitlement in barriers?
    - Viewed entitlement as not a benefit, but as an “I get something you don’t.” Might be perceived as a pain in the butt, and sometimes universities don’t like to mess with that. 

* What is another word you’d use for ‘entitlement’?
    - compensation, fee remission, financial aid, something clearer. 
    
* Started a non-profit a few years ago to help Veterans navigate the “nightmare” system. Excited that we’re doing this — “this is so useful.” 
    - Different states offer different things, it might be nice to add a line about how they should check with state VAs — her son, who’s graduating this year, gets his in-state Indiana tuition paid 100%. 
    - Most people probably want to be close to family or support. My number-1 choice was how receptive IU was to military training. “I got more credit, if you will, given to me by Indiana than I did the other universities I applied to. And in my mind, that’s less stuff I have to take and pay for and wade through. But secondarily, I could get the degree I wanted from there.” Would have been a dealbreaker otherwise.

## Notes

Experience
* Tell me a bit about yourself and what led to you seeking information about the Post 9/11 GI Bill.
    * Left active duty (Army) about 3 years ago. Knew that he wanted to go to college but wasn’t sure how to go about it, and then found out about Ch. 33. Other Vets had heard about it and spoke highly about it, so he looked into it. “I’m glad that I did it because it helped me tremendously.”

* Describe your process for [deciding, applying and using] this benefit? 
    * When active duty gets ready to separate, military “does a great job of preparing them for their future endeavors, whatever they might be.” Edu benefits is one of the things they went over in detail — GI Bill, voc rehab, etc.
    * Went to VA Benefits website — my Benefits and applied there
    * Went to Arkansas Tech, selected it because he wanted to go into nursing after leaving active duty. Chose AT because they have a nursing program, but because they were in the city he lived in. Convenient. Has since changed school and major. “Knowledge is never wasted…I learned things that I’ll be able to use forever.”
    * Changed major because the courses were so difficult. It was a huge strain on him. Marriage was ending simultaneously — was married for 15 years; after leaving active duty that marriage started coming apart. Wife was addicted to Rx pills — he was dealing with that, AND nursing school, and it was just too much. He was _almost_ graduated when he dropped out. “Which was kind of a bummer. I wanted to graduate, but then again, I feel like everything happens for a reason.”
    * Wish he’d started his GI Bill in his current major, because he almost ran out of it because of nursing school. Had to start using vocational rehab benefits to do the current degree
    * Being in nursing school was heartbreaking — paying for everything he had to pay for and then not graduating. Major exit exam that he didn’t take. “That money that I spent was just flushed down the toilet. It was for nothing.”
* How did you plan/track? How did you know how much had left?
    * I didn’t know how much I had left until I left Tech and started going to another school, inquiring about other financial resources from the VA. That’s when he found out about vocrehab. “I never planned it to be this way. I planned on staying in the nursing field and making that a career.”
* Where do you go to get info on Voc Rehab?
    * “Before I was going to Little Rock” where his case worker is. They were e-mailing and calling. His university now has a VA Voc Rehab staffer that he can go to, instead of going to Little Rock.
* What type of paperwork did you need, and how did you get it?
    * Basic stuff that you would need when you start college — ACT score, vaccination record, state background check (for nursing). “The online part of it, with the VA” — on ebenefits. It’s how you apply for [benefits] — downloaded a PDF, filled it out and mailed it in. eBenefits told him where to go and what to fill out. 

Language
* When you were thinking about all of the education benefits -- the different types and paths you could take, what were your options? Describe your process for determining what was right for you.
    * Groupings: trades, benefits, be aware of. “Private schools tend to be expensive.” Went to Kaplan and used GI Bill, and those classes were very expensive. Doesn’t exactly know how the benefit payout works. Used a different chapter of the GI Bill for Kaplan, not Post-9/11 — this is while he was on active duty.
* What helped you understand what benefit you were using for what, and what benefits you had left? 
    * “Luckily for me, and for military personnel, every base that you’re on has an educational counselor. When I was on active duty, I spent a lot of time at the edu office…asking them questions about education, the different chapters, the process….they set me up [with a plan].” 
    * “They kind of laid the framework for my future endeavors.” 
    * They gave him pamphlets, they’re very well-trained — but they couldn’t tell him not to go to Kaplan!
    * Didn’t do any cost-comparison when it comes to tuition. 

Showing eBenefits

    * “I don’t remember viewing this entitlement page when I went to AT. I think it’s for people who are using post-9/11 to look up where they’re at, how much they have left…all of that kind of thing.”
* How would you use this page?
    * “I would use this page to keep updated on when my benefit expires and how many months I have remaining.”
    * “I almost ran out, this kind of thing would be very helpful to me.”
    * The first thing that seems foreign is the “delimiting date” — “it just seems like a weird, strange word to use, and at first glance I’m not 100% sure I know the exact meaning of the word ‘delimiting.’”
    * “If I had to guess I’d say it’s the opposite of eligibility date, which is above it.”
    * “I’m not sure I know what distance hours are” versus residence hours.
    * Residence hours “aren’t those the hours you spend in the classroom, on campus?”
* Given your trajectory, what’s missing from this page for you? What one thing would you change about it?
    * If I could change anything, I would change the enrollment history. I would list my current enrollment period and other periods that I’ve used VA benefits, not just 9/11, so that I could get a bigger picture of a steady progression towards where I”m going. “Sometimes you can’t get a clear direction of where you’re going until you know where you’ve been.”
    * “I don’t know what it refers to — COE letter.”
* Have you gone to eBenefits to get letters?
    * On Voc Rehab they pretty much look everything up for you — they have files for everything, so the amount of paperwork you have to submit is very little if any.
    * For post-9/11, you do have to submit a little more. When active duty, can’t remember what he had to submit but doesn’t remember it as being much.
* Why nursing school?
    * Felt a calling to help people. Wanted to be military since he was a kid; was in for 16 years, felt it was right and honorable as a citizen of the US. After leaving the service, wanted to continue that direction and sense of purpose — of making the world a better place. “I’ve always felt a calling to help people in need. That’s what I loved about being in nursing. I’ve always been told that I’m a good people person, I’m a good communicator, I’m easy to talk to, I’m a good listener. These skills that I have…will help me, whether it be in nursing or social work. Social work is my major now.” 
    * “When I leave this world, I want to leave it a letter better than when I found it.”
    * Was a fueler in the military. Before he started nursing school, looked up careers and jobs and employment opportunities that were most needed in the state of Arkansas. Also took a career personality test, the result was one of these “helping” careers, such as nursing, or social work. “I felt like I was best suited for that, from taking this exam.”
    * If there was any way to improve post-9/11 GI Bill: before the application process, I would just make sure that the Veterans have a plan. “Having a plan — that’s a big deal. I feel bad for any Veteran that would go to school…just for the money. And not with a certain goal, a direction in mind.”

## What We Shouldn't Forget

- Top learnings/surprises
   - Abby was mailed information on her benefits usage once a month. This is how she knew how much she had left. The information is similar to what is on eBenefits Post 9/11 Status page. 
   - Abby tells people to create a timeline and use the benefits when you most need it financially. I.E. don't use it for community college. Use another benefit for the cheap stuff.
   - Abby didn't know until she was almost finished with her bachelors that she could use the benefit to get her pilot license. Her vet counselor on campus, Cheryl, told her this. She seemed super bummed she didn't end up being a pilot but very happy with where she is at today.
- Main takeaway
   - There is so much you can do with the Post 9/11 GI Bill that people do not know. 
   - People should not navigate benefits in silos, but rather be able to see how they can use them together to get the greatest gain. 
- Other people we should interview
   - Cheryl, the FSU liaison

## Notes

Top 3:
* Having an experienced certifying officer is a huge advantage
* GI Bill is measured in months/semesters, not credit-hours 
* GI Bill can be used for non-traditional four-year university training

Experience
* Tell me a bit about yourself and what led to you seeking information about the Post 9/11 GI Bill.
    * Got out of the Air Force and was going to save the GI Bill (Chapter 30) at the end of 2007. Then Post-9/11 was signed in, and “I was like, weeeeelll, this is better, so maybe I’ll do that! So I did.”
    * The stipend, flexible amount — if she wanted to take more coursework to get done more quickly, she could. This made post-9/11 better than Ch 30.
    * “I read the legislation, because I”m a giant nerd! When they released it, I read it, and weighed the option. Ended up applying and enrolling at FSU…when it went into effect in 2009.”
    * Was airborne intel, assigned to learn/use Chinese
    * After service, was working for a lighting manufacturer in China but didn’t like the job, even though it was good money. 
    * “Kind of felt that post-9/11 GI Bill was a sign that now’s the time!” Got a BA in Chinese, and then her Master’s. 
    * Divorced, but when they moved to Tallahassee they weren’t. Moved because of FSU and his family. “I didn’t really think about it, but living here, [decided to go]. Went and talked to a couple of people in the modern languages department to see what would transfer. And really nothing did, which was (sarcastic?) awesome. I could say “ICBM” in Chinese, but I couldn’t say ‘it’s snowing’ so I figured I could use a refresher.”
    * Took Chinese 1, 2, 3 simultaneously in the same semester. “To get the credits to count, because nothing transfer.”
    * “I had the AA though, so all of the gen-ed stuff was done.”
    * Talked to the certifying official. She’d been doing it for a while, answered all her questions. The CO is the person who says “yeah, you’re taking classes” and sends that info to VA. Point person between VA and school for education benefits.
    * Around 10/11, “they said, hey this job doesn’t exist anymore, sorry about your life.” So one of her professors suggested she go to grad school. Had four semesters of GI Bill left  — just long enough for masters. Int’l affairs, because she still wanted to work for State.
    * VA would send a letter once a month that says, “You have this many months left, this is your rate…” info on GI Bill. “It has a bunch of technical stuff..the first page is useful!”
    * Ran out literally in April when she graduated in May (2013) — great timing.
    * The rate is 100%, or if you get less — it just gives you the percentage that they cover. Her rate never changed for the duration of her benefit.
    * The rate is decided by time in service.

* What did you know then, v. What you know now?
    * “I was fortunate, because…Cheryl’s [certifying official] amazing and knows everything. She makes it her business to know everything about…all of the benefits.”
    * “My biggest question was — I didn’t have enough benefits to cover the last two weeks of school.” Cheryl had an immediate answer. “I never had anything that was a looming question, because I could just ask her. Now, the only bummer was that it was cut right when I was done with my bachelor’s and starting my master’s, so the gaps between classes went away.” [gap pay] Took out loans to cover the gaps. 
    * Is currently a PhD candidate. “Oh, fun story! Because I was a Presidential Management Fellow and was supposed to start that position in 8/2013 but there was another sequester…most of the positions were cut…but mine, they said they could still give it to me at a much lower pay rate. I was like, no I’m good.” Same professor suggested PhD. “I think eh just wants to keep me here forever.”
    * A while ago, “there was that thing called Wave. I think that was just for Chapter 30. My husband used 30 because he started before 2009.” But I’ve been on eBenefits, and it’s awesome.
    * Uses eBenefits to check her benefits status. The layout is the same as the letter. 
    * If you go through Tallahassee CC and get your AA you get auto admission to FSU. A lot of people will go to TCC if their scores aren’t high enough for FSU. Abby will also suggest people look into a Pell Grant, which will cover most CC tuition in Florida. Do that and save GI Bill for FSU, which has higher tuition. Also save it for grad school. eBenefits can help you plan this. 
    * GI Bill will cover 18 hours just as much as it’ll cover 12 — it’s time-based, not credit-hour based.

* How do you “plan your timeline”
    * “I don’t plan anything for people.” FSU sees a lot of Veterans who want to go to grad school but have run out of GI Bill. She works with people at TCC to nudge people to save their GI Bill. 

Looking at eBenefits

* What’s most useful?
    * “The right column!” [Entitlement Duration]
    * “You know exactly how much you’ll get paid
    * You don’t have to use your benefits for a summer, for example, so you can use eBenefits to help plan your usage.
    * “Oh, that’s the COE letter! That’s the letter I was talking about. You used to have to bring that letter to the school…so they could verify that you have benefits left.”
    * There’s a checklist on the FSU Veterans’ Center website [http://veterans.fsu.edu/students/application-checklist/]
    * She used to have to bring in the letter VA mailed to her. When you use form 1990 they give you a confirmation number and that’s all you need to do
* She’s going to e-introduce us to Cheryl
* When asked if TCC-benefits-hack was a common thing?
    * When I say it to women, they say “oh, I haven’t thought of that”, and when I say it to guys, they’re like “oh I’m never going to school [after this] again!” —> women listen more
    * That you can use this for non-formal training is not an obvious thing — she didn’t know until she was almost done with her bachelor’s.
        * Cheryl told her!!  
    * Works with student veterans of America — feels like some veterans have this impression that they’re obliged to GI Bill. “There are some people who just don’t need to be in college, but you can still use your GI Bill!”

## Notes
Cheryl - Liaison at FSU

* Has been certifying official for 16 years
* Is a veteran (medical, 25 years), her son is a veteran
* Enjoyed it until 2009 when the Post-9/11 GI Bill came around, and things drastically changed for her
* Is on the state board and belongs to the national membership of certifying officials and in both of those realms she’s helped add input and make viable changes to “what we saw were problems through those efforts.”
* It was made into law in March 2009, and they were told to implement it in fall of the same year. “We’re talking about a massive change in…computer programs, processes, understanding of the law. Everything had to be done in a very short period of time. Because of that, we learned as we went…VA side of it, Veteran side of it, school side of it.”
* “With any kind of process, there are things that come up that you didn’t think about. Understanding of policy that you didn’t think through. When it started to be implemented, questions came up. Understanding of interpretation changed almost on a daily basis. We were constantly, constantly getting information from…our edu liaison reps….from the VA.” 
    * These are the people who provide policy and interpretation from VA. COs have to go by that. “It was a constant moving machine at first. So we would tell the Veterans ‘we need this.’” And then things would change.
    * “It was just a very trying time. We went from a total population of 3-4 hundred…and we just exploded, sometimes doubling and almost tripling that in a very short period of time.” With the limited resources that they had, so they had to ask for more. 
* We try to defer students to the VA directly. She tells students not to use websites that are NOT VA when trying to make decisions. “Always get your information directly from the source.” Knows there are well-intentioned orgs and sites, but literally VA is the place to get the info. 
* “I try to ask a lot of questions.” To differentiate which chapter of the GI Bill they should use — Montgomery or Post-9/11
    * 9/11 is “rate of pursuit” so if you’re using post-9/11 in active duty you’ll use it much more quickly
    * They need to make decisions about what they want to use their benefits for, for how long, are they transferring to their dependents? Are they saving some? All things to consider. 
    * “There are going to be changes I’m sure coming up soon because the Chapter 30 is going to end and then you’re only going to have Post-9/11 or whatever’s available at the time.”
    * “It’s hard to be specific…every single, solitary student is a different story…it’s a totally different process for every single student.”
* What resources do you find most helpful?
    * eBenefits, phone call. The phone call “is a tricky one.” “Sometimes the phone section has not been educated enough to answer some questions.”
    * The comparison tool “is something that they should be able to use, however, being at school…the comparison tool is not accurate. For instance, it says [FSU’s] graduation rate is 0.” 
        * The way the graduation rate is calculated results in a false number. 
    * Doing applications online is faster, more accurate — goes straight into the system, as opposed to snail mail, which has to be imaged, etc.
    * Status updates exist on eBenefits — she gives students instructions, but that shows the most recent status of all kinds of things.
    * COs don’t have access to a student’s current entitlement unless they call VA, which is virtually impossible because of the number of students. So they ask students to provide COE or award letter that they receive every time they’re certified. Or, they’re asked for a screenshot of eBenefits.
        * This gives her the context to know how to counsel them, in case their benefits are going to run out
    * What’s the benefit level? How much entitlement do they have left? “You can counsel the student on what to prepare for.”
    * Delimiting date is based on their date of discharge. It is the “end all, be all” — 15 years post-discharge
* What information is missing from this page?
    * The actual date that this is (today’s date) “We give students the benefit of the doubt that they’re sending us the screenshot taken today.”
    * Enrollment history — that is the opposite, I wish it were the most recent one at the top (when there are multiple institutions”
    * They have access to VA Once, which is the very secure processing system for COs. They can see every certification that’s been created since 2005. 
        * Their job as COs is to look at the student’s schedule + records + degree programs, and then tell VA “John smith is enrolled in 12 hours towards x, y, z” — makes sure that every single one of the classes being taken fits into the 120 hours needed for the degree.
        * VAO has all the current info on each student. VA within three days can see it in their system, and process it.
    * The students who can get into eBenefits tend to lean towards that once they learn how to get in; the mailed copy tends to get lost/thrown out. “They move a lot…it can go to the wrong address.”
    * The VA is working on a process “we’ve been promised this for two, three years now, that the VA will create a way for us as COs to access this information without calling, and every time we turn around we’re told there’s no funds. Last year they were mandated to do it…we were told that yeah we’re working on it but have hit a road block. We don’t know where they stand on it.”
    * “They were talking about creating VA Once in a different format” except then the old s system and the new system weren’t going to coordinate.
    * It really gets complicated when you start dealing with federal tuition assistance and other military financial aid. The military’s not doing a good job of handling that or of explaining to veterans as they need it. “I get students constantly telling me that they didn’t hear anything, or it’s way too much information so they turn off at a certain point.”
    * There needs to be better on-base education about using federal benefits; on-base personnel aren’t very well trained to answer questions re: education benefits.


* Friend of her is doing a survey that she wants us to be aware of. Dr. Chance DelSignor (?) working with Purdue — she’s working the CO side of the same thing we’re working on.

## Notes

Questions:
* Gap pay?
    * Not much insight — this is depending on how the school is run. From VA central office, you can’t tell 
* Biggest pitfall in application?
    * “Their buddies give them bad information.” Then the VA is dealing with “barracks lawyers — aw man, they can’t do that to you.”
    * TAP - transition assistance program. Every service member will go through this on the way out. GI Bill guy is part of this, but it’s different because they’re teaching like a college class — the military culture is more hands-on, so presenting info like a school is not how they’re used to it. 
    * TAP total is two weeks — run by the DoD
* What software are you using for visual impairment?
* What would you change, given a magic wand, about post-9/11 GI Bill?
    * He’d have them change that it’s permanent — and what he means is that right now, ti’s a war-time benefit. Since we’re winding down, they’re pulling all kinds of features of the bill — transfer to dependents, extending for STEM. 
    * Post-9/11 you don’t pay into like you did with Montgomery. “It’s a wild Wild West right now, and they’re getting ready to shred it.”
    * He would ask that they mandate that every Veteran pay in so that there’s some permanence, consistency. 
    * There’s a lot of concern among Veterans that the benefit is going to evaporate — mitigates by putting out good information.
    * OFF THE RECORD/INDEPENDENT CITIZEN: Student Veterans is very young, post post-9/11. All we do is help student vets get educated and use their GI Bill. We compete with “mafia organizations” that have been around for over 100 years for Veterans, whose drive is to make sure they stay relevant. Our job is to make sure GI Bill stays around. Mafia orgs are deeply embedded into DC roots, and they control policy — so the stuff that gets passed in Congress isn’t the best, but is what keeps those orgs relevant. 
    * VA will mention SVA by name — in a good way. They don’t charge a membership fee. They have a registered lobbyist, who represents legislation but “doesn’t do lobbyist stuff”
    * One thing he’d change about the benefits portal: he’d want paperwork related to their disability that veterans can print off to hand off to their disability officers on campus for the purposes for seeking further services 
    * He would want disability and education 
    * “The peer-based network has to have good information to start with….to be able to provide [solid information].”
        * Nobody knows about Vets.gov — it hasn’t been marketed as “this is the place to go to.”

Experience
* Tell me a bit about yourself and what led to you seeking information about the Post 9/11 GI Bill.
    * Works at Student Veterans of America — the only nonprofit in the veterans’ space that specifically caters to VA edu benefits. He’s the disability director. “What I’m noticing more and more of is there’s a lot of Veterans going from the military into school…when we’re getting demographics, we’re finding more and more that they’re using the GI Bill as a transition tool…kind of a surrogate for an income source as they figure [out employment].”
    * Didn’t use Ch. 33, used Voc Rehab. “I am very interested in understanding the process better.” The networks is massive; he wants to understand those veterans better.
    * Post-9/11 didn’t exist when he started school in 2005. Finished his masters in 2013. 
* What questions do people come to you with?
    * The big one for him as the disability guy is “should I apply for post-9/11 or VA voc rehab”, followed by “why should I do it?”
    * A lot of times they don’t understand that voc rehab is vocation based. There’s a lot more freedom for post-9/11.
    * Post-9/11 is usually a better benefit than voc rehab.
    * The other big one is how do you use it, how do you apply for it?
    * How much money can I make off the GI Bill? That question leads into “should I be working in school” and depending on how much it pays, they may not need to look for employment right away. 
    * Most of the time students can figure out where to go because they google it, but sometimes “they need to hear it from another Veteran…I provide the blanket for them to be comfortable that they’re doing it right.”
        * They need to hear it from another Vet because of the military model. “It’s based on a mentorship model, and then when they get out, there are no mentors around…they look for someone they can trust….They trust other Veterans….there’s a security blanket that’s there….”
    * Most Veterans are filing almost exclusively online, and they trust that process. The basis of that trust is that they’re going to the VA, which is an authority figure (whether they want to be or not). Whatever the VA says gets propagated. “That’s an authority figure that they trust.”
* Do they ever stumble across other websites when they Google, and then ask you about them?
    * “There’s places out there that provide background help, and some of those have old information. They’re not necessarily maliciously misleading Veterans…but they’re getting old information.”
    * FAFSA is the other one — FAFSA.com charges people, and FAFSA.gov does not. 
    * Another big question: “Can I apply for the Pell Grant?”
    * Education gets interrupted more often than not. “Some guys get deployed, and they have to stop.” A big thing is having already paid and then having to drop out — what do they do then? That question leads into “I paid for a full semester…had to withdraw…do I get my money back/reinstated…how does that work?” Those questions are always pushed back to the certifying official on campus. “We try to connect them to the information rather than give them an answer.”

Doing card-sort
* He’s visually impaired and his software zooms his screen way way up. 

Looking at eBenefits
    * Delimiting date is a weird word — it doesn’t make sense off the bat 
    * They have fifteen years to use it, not fifteen years to START it.
    * He likes the countdown of what’s left to use/how long left to use — would like a countdown of how long they have left even if they haven’t started. 
    * Looking at “100%”, he immediately thinks “disability rating” — he knows what it means, but it’s confusing — is there a way to clarify this?
        * He’d add something to the effect that they know it’s GI Bill and nothing else
        * Benefit level often gets called a “rating”
