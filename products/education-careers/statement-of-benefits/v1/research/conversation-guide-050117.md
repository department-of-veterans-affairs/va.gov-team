# Post 9/11 GI Bill Research with Veterans

## Problem Statement (veterans)

As a veteran, I want to better understand where I am at in my path towards completing my education so that I can make sure I am using the 9/11 GI Bill benefit efficiently and effectively. 

## Assumptions

- Veterans want to know how much of their education benefit is remaining.
- Veterans want to apply to get this education benefit.
- Veterans are looking for this information under education benefits.
- Veterans visit this page at the beginning of their education to plan their education path.
- Veterans revisit this page when there is a disruption in their plan.
- Veterans know they are eligible for this benefit before they search for this information.

## What We Want to Learn

- What is the language people use to describe these benefits?
- Who is looking for GI Bill benefits? Why?
- What life events happen before, during and after veterans use their benefit?
- Are they coming to get proof of eligibility? When do veterans need to submit proof of GI Bill eligibility?
- What does the communication ecosystem look like for benefits?

## Interview

### Welcome and Opening Remarks

Thank you for joining us today. My name is [NAME] and we also have [NAME OF OTHERS OBSERVING] observing and taking notes for this session. Today we are hoping to learn more about your process for finding and using your education benefits.

In this session, I’ll ask you to tell me about your experiences and it’ll feel like you are talking a lot. That is good! Today is all about you and the more we learn about your experiences, the better. There are no right or wrong answers.

Some quick admin notes: 

  * This entire feedback session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question or task.
  * We’ll be recording the screen activities as we look at the site. Recording our discussion today will help us capture everything you say accurately.
  * If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.


### Experience

Tell me a bit about yourself and what led to you seeking information about the Post 9/11 GI Bill. 

Describe your process for [deciding, applying and using] this benefit? When did you have to share your certificate of eligibility? How did you get it?

Were you always interested in [education path]? What did you want to do before? Why did you decide to switch paths?

### Language

When you were thinking about all of the education benefits -- the different types and paths you could take, what were your options? Describe your process for determining what was right for you.
- We will do this as a card sorting activity if we can.

Were there any options you knew right away were not a good fit? Why?

What were the different milestones you knew you had to pass along the way?

### Community

Tell me about a person that was particularly helpful during this process. Why was this important?

Now, I want you to think about a time when someone led you down a path you didn't quite expect. How did you correct this?

### Communication

When you needed help during this process, how did you let others know? Is this different than your typical day-to-day interactions?

Typically, when you need information about something, how do you find it?

Tell me one change you would make to improve your iteractions during this process. 

### Progression

I want you to think back to a time when you went through another application process that wasn’t applying for education benefits. Think of a time when it was a good experience. Tell me about it. 

Now, tell me one thing you would change about your process for [deciding, applying and using] this benefit?

### Technology

Are there any websites or apps you used during this process that you would like to share with me?

What about other websites or apps that help you with scheduling or planning activities?
