# Conversation Guide: VR&E

## Goals

1. Where do Veterans and active duty servicemembers look for information on VR&E?
2. Are Veterans and current servicemembers able to determine the VR&E benefits for which they are eligible? Are they able to determine what to do to receive those benefits?
3. Are there words or concepts that are still unclear to Veterans or active duty servicemembers?
4. Is the order of operations on [Programs for Servicemembers and Veterans](https://vetsgov-pr-6337.herokuapp.com/vocational-rehab-and-employment/service-disabled/) clear (apply, *then* pick a track)?

## We will know we have been successful if:

1. We are able to determine where Veterans, active duty servicemembers, and VSO representatives would expect to find VR&E content.
2. We have a sense as to which areas of the section are clear or confusing to participants, and they are able to share presence or absence of understanding about the benefits for which they are eligible and the process for applying for them.

## Who are our participants?

2 participants are Veterans who have a service connected disability and are not currently using VR&E benefits.

2 participants are active duty servicemembers who have a service connected disability and are not currently enrolled in [IDES](https://vetsgov-pr-6337.herokuapp.com/disability-benefits/apply/claim-types/predischarge-claim/).

2 participants are Veteran Service Officers.

## Key research questions

1. Where should VR&E fit within the larger structure of Vets.gov?
2. Are key audience groups able to understand and make sense of the content in the VR&E section?

## Methods

- Remote usability testing of the VR&E section of staging. Guided tasks, some interview-style questions.

### Introduction

Thank you for joining us today. My name is Elissa, and I'm joined on the line by some colleagues who are observing the session and helping me take notes. We are doing this feedback session on behalf of the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs to learn how to make one section of our website more useful to you.  

Before we begin, I’d like to make a few things clear and explain how the session will work.

**We aren’t testing your ability.** In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we want to hear whether this section of the site makes sense to you. I'm hoping this can be an honest conversation between you and me, and I promise I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.

**Please think aloud.** While you are going through the site, please try as much as possible to vocalize your reactions, thoughts, and decisions as you see each page. That helps us to better share your thoughts with other members of our team. 

**This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be respectful of your time, so I may move us along a little faster at various points.

**If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**  You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop, and you will still receive your $25 thank you. 

Do you have any questions at this stage?

Are you comfortable if I record this session? I'd like to record our conversation and what you do on the screen  so we can make sure to capture your thoughts accurately. 

Great! I'm going to turn on screen and audio recording now.

[The moderator will begin audio and screen recording.]

### Warm-up questions

Before we dig in on the site, I'd like to ask you a few questions so we get used to talking togther.

- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work)
- What's your favorite thing about living in [place]?
- Are you familiar with Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment services through the VA? Are you using those benefits/plan to use those benefits?

### Getting situated on Vets.gov

- Have you ever used Vets.gov before?
- When you have questions about your VA benefits, where do you go to find information?

Now I'm going to share my screen with you. You should see the Vets.gov homepage.

### Finding VR&E

Feel free to take a minute to look around the homepage.

- Who is this site for? Why do you think that?
- What can people do on this site?
- Where would you look to find VR&E content? What are you hoping to find there?

_Walk through with them whether they find it or not. What led you to think you would find it there? What are the other headings in that section? How does it fit or not fit with those?_

**Active-duty Servicemembers**: Would they think to look under Predischarge claim in Disability?
