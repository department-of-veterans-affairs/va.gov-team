# VRE Eligibility Wizard and Form Research Findings

## Synthesis: suggestions for the future

## Eligibility wizard

- This was a pleasant surprise to all Veterans with whom we spoke. Many also appreciated having the ability to check it against the longer list of criteria, without having to worry they missed anything.
  - Veterans are accustomed to being asked questions in certain ways. As a result, the phrasing of the discharge status question was confusing, and two selected the option that did not align with their actual status. **Suggestion:** keep this wording the same across all Vets.gov forms and wizards.
- The most difficult portion of the wizard was figuring out what Veterans were eligible for or applying for. The wizard promised eligibility for VR&E benefits, but the end result only delivers counseling as a possible benefit. Two associated counseling with PTSD or other mental health challenges, and none understood it as a necessary first step to accessing VR&E benefits. This was further made confusing by the addition of a second link on that page: what would Veterans be applying for? Were they eligible for counseling but not other benefits? Why should they apply?
  - **Suggestion:** clarify the process on the results screen. Rename or explain what "counseling" is and be clear that it is a first step to accessing other benefits. 
    - Would love to discuss the scenarios in which someone would apply for VRE directly from this wizard and whether the second link is even necessary. Also, ensure that the way this link is named (if it persists) does not imply that the ch 36 benefit does not have an online application.
  - **Suggestion:** If someone is not eligible, this can still be an opportunity to surface the other areas of Vets.gov. Rather than just "we're sorry," perhaps explain the disqualifying attribute and point towards other possible benefits. 

### Ch. 36 form

- The lack of clarity around what Veterans were applying for continued into the form. Regardless of whether they were asked at step 1 or step 6, all Veterans were confused about what they were applying for, and how it related to getting VR&E benefits. This was not helped by the difference between the title of the breadcrumb and the title of the form on the first page—to the point that one Veteran wanted to click on the breadcrumb rather than fill out the application.
- The most challenging page was step 3, which asked about other benefits the Veteran had applied for. Three Veterans specifically mentioned confusion about what "Veterans Educational Assistance" meant, and none were clear on what "other" entailed: just education benefits, or health and disability as well?
  - **Suggestion:** I would like to test this again with more specific language and a better understanding of why this question is being asked, which would help us clarify the language to use on this page.
  - **Information from the stakeholder:** A counselor needs to look at the applicants' overall benefits received to make a holistic recommendation for next steps.
- Two Veterans did not understand why contact information was split up over three pages, with the last two broken out by four steps from the first one.
  - **Suggestion:** if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Follow Veteran expectations about getting the pre-filled PII out of the way first. Also, if there are multiple pages under one form step, 5.1 implies 1/10, rather than 5a, which could be 1/2.
  - Prefill was appreciated, particularly since this form was tested on a mobile device. Veterans expressed gratitude for having to type less information in.
  - Periods of service + adding additional ones was clear to everyone. Since DD-214 was listed up front as something Veterans might need, one was curious why they weren't just asked for the DD-214 rather than having to enter the information in. 
- The form was deceptively short. After being asked for their discharge status and disability rating on the eligibility wizard, Veterans expressed confusion over why these did not appear on the form as well.
  - **Clarify:** is this information (discharge status and disability rating) needed for the form, or not? Is it a kindness to the Veteran to ask for it, so they feel more confident in trusting the outcome of their application?
-  Editing was largely used as expected. One person did not see a place to edit and did not click on the plus signs, and one was worried that if he clicked on the plus sign he would lose all the information he had already entered.
- Confirmation page: some Veterans expressed gratitude at having a confirmation number and a phone number where they could bring a human into the process. Some also asked whether the same information would be emailed to them, since they'd already provided their email address.

## Insights

### What worked well

- Eligibility wizard itself was a pleasant surprise.
  - "If [my dad] had questions he could just answer, it would alleviate confusion" about the block of eligibility criteria. "Glancing at it, you may forget one thing."
  - BUT 2 people said they also liked having the option of reading through
- Prepopulated form after sign-in was appreciated
  - "The less info you have to type the better", especially on mobile
- Editing worked well…with reservations (see below)
- Confirmation: 2 appreciated the knowledge there was a human in the loop and the ability to make a phone call

### What would benefit from improvement

*Eligibility: final screen*

- What is counseling?
  - Two participants mentioned assuming it referred to counseling for PTSD or other mental health concerns
  - One said they would only apply for counseling if they were uncertain about their eligibility.
  - "I don't even know what applying for vocational counseling is!"
- How do I apply?
  - One thought the green button would be a link to a printable form, since it did not specify "apply online" like the link did
  - "I don't know what the apply for counseling button does"
  - Two noticed the "magical" green button, which was what the site wanted them to do but did not stop them from using the blue link
- Am I eligible?
  - If eligible, need clarity on what you're applying for
    - "May" be eligible was "disheartening" - "why should I apply only to be rejected?"
  - If not eligible: would expect to find out why and receive other options, feels abrupt
  - Language "Other than dishonorable" confused almost everyone - it took longer than other steps for them to figure out what to select, and two selected the option that did not correlate to their actual status.

*The form itself*

- What am I applying for?
  - 3/5 Veterans thought they were applying for Ch. 31 benefits
- Structure
  - 2 people confused about why PII was separated out across 3 screens
    - One expected to have 10 steps in step 5, after seeing 5.1 and 5.2
  - Why is it so short?
    - 2 expected to be asked about their disability rating on the form
    - 1 expected to be asked for DD214 rather than periods of service; others were clear on how to add
  - What else applied for?
    - People who thought they were applying for 31 thought they were being asked about whether they had applied before
    - 3 Were unclear on "Veterans Educational Assistance"
    - "Other" was unclear - education benefits? Any VA benefits? Would there be a text box?
- Review application
  - One worried about losing the site if they clicked on +, one didn't know what they were reviewing
