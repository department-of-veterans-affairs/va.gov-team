# VR&E Sept-Oct Research: Participant Thoughts on Application

- "I don't even know what an eBenefits account is!"
- One participant tried to click on #4 on the subway map under one of the benefit tracks
- Make clear the order of operations: apply for VR&E *first*, then determine a track, rather than applying directly to the track
- Put services up front - why would I want to apply for VR&E
- Difference between servicemember and veteran eligibility - some of this has to be resolved in content, but will also factor into determining elibility in the form (see [this blue box](https://vetsgov-pr-6337.herokuapp.com/vocational-rehab-and-employment/eligibility/) which winds up being unintelligible)
- Families of some veterans are eligible for VR&E as well - see how that might play into building the application and who has to fill it out ("I am a...")
- Is there a way for the veteran to determine their eligibility (wizard?) as part of the form?
