### Warm-up questions

- *Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work)*


went in right after high school in 2006, out in 2008 

was a bridge crew member engineer

deployed to Germany

Did a few different jobs from security to Walmart manager to odds and ends jobs at parents company, to going to school in and out, attempted to go back to school lately after he couldn't work anymore.

Right now would love to go back to school for food science, permaculture, agricultural science…etc


- *What's your favorite thing about living in [place]?*


Houston, TX

Hate living here.


- *Have you used the VA for services before? If yes, which? If not, why not?*


Yes.

Service connected. Use healthcare. choice program. 

Mostly healthcare, mental health, integration.


- *How do you access benefits? Do you use any online services to manage them? What was that experience like?*


Do you ever go online? yeah somewhat. I like the layout better before they changed it for me. I'm still trying to relearn it. (Ebenifits ) The layout to me was easier. I knew where everything was. It was simpler to me. Stuff wasn't hidden. Now I have to go and pull down tabs to search for other stuff… it's like a continuous search.. like where is waldo. I don't know what is in each tab. A good analogy would be if you take a person who is used to working in Microsoft computer and place them in front of a Macbook.


- *Are you familiar with Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment services through the VA? Are you using those benefits? Do you plan to use those benefits in the future?*


I used Chapter 31 to go to school starting in 2015 and it kind of faded out. I'm not sure if i'm still in there. 

Once you're inactive from going to school for 6 months, the school is supposed to drop me from the program. But i also have had surgery within the 6 months. I also had difficulties with school that i had expressed to her i needed to go to another school because of my disabilities to fit me better. They said the VA wasn't gonna pay for it cuz the school wasn't accredited. 

(who to reach out to to get back on the benefits) nobody to tell the truth. After over 2 years of going back and forth and dealing with my couselor is kind of depressing, discouraging. Like a slap in the face. They're like shit you're out of luck. You can't go to another school. I pulled up the federal regulation off of the government site that says if you're disability is this rate, they're supposed to put me in another program. 

I had a break in for the laptop - i had video proof of everything but i was never able to get the laptop replaced. After 2 years they are supposed to get me another one. I feel like i'm pushed to a point where i'm fed up and i don't want to do it right now. 

I don't know where to go, what to do, who to go to. I'm not saying she was a bad counselor, maybe she didn't know what to do in this situation. 


### Getting situated on Vets.gov

- *Have you ever used Vets.gov before?*


never heard of it

It's for vets. federal employees. 

.gov are extension for federal employee


- *When you have questions about your VA benefits, where do you go to find information?*





### Finding out your eligibility 

Prototype: https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/KXF2UUB3H

*Feel free to take a minute to look around the eligibility page*

**_Prototype page 1_**
- *Read through the content in this page. How would you go about finding out whether or not you are eligible for VR&E benefits?*


I would click on eligibility.

you then would read the list summary and they usually have other questionaire. after you do the questionnaire they would tell you yes or no.

I would click on Veteran. After clicking next, it would go to a screen asking about service connected or something like that. 

(received a discharge other than dishonorable) Well that should be one of the questions. you click on no if you got a good discharge. yes if you got a bad discharge.

I have a traumatic brain injury. Cognitive and comprehesion takes a while. 

I would click no. Then it should ask about the disability %.

10% is all you need technically. They moved it down last year.

To get a new disability, they need to put in a new claim, and they will be given a new %. 

- *Who is eligible for VR&E benefits?*






- *What do you think would happen if you selected your service criteria and hit next?*




- *Why do you think you're being asked these questions?*



- *How many more steps do you think there are before you find out whether or not you are eligible for VR&E benefits?*


I want to say this is it, but maybe there is one more step. Maybe dependents and family members?


- *What do you think would happen if you clicked "no" on discharge in past 12 years?*


They would not qualify because they passed the time limit. Wow i didn't know. They must have changed it.


**_Last step - eligibility decision_**
- *Is this what you thought you would see here?*


Oh ok! This is different from the previous site.

This one is actually a bit more streamlined and colorful.

it's helpful. It doesn't look like the dept of defense site. It's much nicer.


- *What else do you want to know about your eligibility now?*





- *Does this information help you determine whether you are eligible for VR&E benefits?*





- *Do you have more information now than at the beginning of this process about whether or not you are eligible for VR&E benefits? If yes, what information?*





- *What would you do next?*


I would go straight to apply for counseling. That one is highlight big and bright. 

I just now noticed that i can also apply online. To tell you the truth a lot of people won't notice that the disabled Veteran application.

I don't even know to tell you the truth (how those 2 links are different)

Is the bottom for broke people, and the top part for none broke people? Or maybe one for old war vets, the other for new war vets? I would like 

I would be mad if they tell me i didn't apply online, but i didn't see that blue link.


- *What do you think you would see here if you weren't eligible?*



- *What would you do if you disagreed with this information?*



- *Do you feel that you have enough information to apply? If not, what else do you want to know? Where would you go to find that information?*



- *Where would you go to begin the application process, if you were ready to apply?*





- *What would you expect to happen if you clicked on [either call to action]? Did you notice the other link? If you clicked that link, what would you expect to happen?*

The green button: I guess that will get me a counselor? To be honest i don't even know.



*Ok, now we're going to look at the application for VR&E itself. Even though you're on a computer right now, I'm going to show you what the application would look like if you were applying using a mobile phone. Do you currently use a smartphone?*

### Apply for VR&E (Chapter 36)

Prototype: https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/G9F1A8U7K

**_Form landing page_**
- *What is the first thing you would do upon arriving on this page?*

I would go to VA site now 

First i would take down the phone number.

Go to the VA site and go to the government form section and down load the form to print it out. And i would come back here to follow the steps.



Do you think you could apply online? Oh! I didn't know you could do that. I'm not sure if the "apply online" on top is a hyper link?

I know I can sign into my account because it's a hyper link. I know I can start the VR&E box.

- *Do you have enough information to begin the application?*


(reading through the page)

No. not yet. I would need to go over to ebenefits to download my dd214 and come back here and then apply. 

Usually you would have to upload the document on the old app.


- *What information do you think you might find out if you scroll down?*





- *Is this what you were expecting to see?*

This would take me to a page asking me "are you sure you want to apply". How long it takes, save…etc all that stuff

**_Interior pages_**
- *Were you expecting to be asked this information? (piece by piece)*

I think it would take me less than 5 minutes.

Chap1: this is easy.

What do you think it would ask you next? "i'm not sure"

Chap 2: VA file number is the same number on my DOD or VA card. 

What do you think it would ask you next? Discharge

Chap 3: no i didn't expect to see this. I would only check the 1st one. I don't know what they mean with the 2nd one. 

What do you think "other"might mean here? I'm not sure. They're giving me too many options and leaving too broad and open. Would they be able to simplify these? 

How would you simplify it? I would just say "montgomery GI BIll series" "Chapter 33" "Post 911 "..i would just say the names

Why do you think you're being asked this question? I know other Veternas are gonna look at this and get angry and trying to figure out what it is.

I don't even know where hazelwood would fall under. It's something Texas gets. It's when you exhaust all your schooling stuff you get hazelwood.

Chap 4: This one speaks for itself.

What do you think we're applying for? Voc rehab right? I think so i lost track. I would scroll back up… oh vocational counseling! I don't even know what applying for vocational counseling is!

What do you think is left to be asked? I guess it's about your disabilities. 

Chap 5: No i don't expect to see this. Oh mailing address… ok. they still use snail mail. ok. They can send you a hard copy. Just in case anything goes down you can't blame the VA because they always claim they have sent the stuff to you.



After hitting continue it would tell me i've finished and submited 

- *Why is the VA asking for this information?*



- *Do you have all the information you need to successfully apply for VR&E counseling?* 
- *Is there anything you see here that is confusing to you?*

**_Review page_**

- *How would you review the information you've entered?*

I thought about it and i didn't think it was gonna do it. I thought it would skip it just like a lot of other stuff. Like the prompts and warrant signs at the beginning and the end.

- *What would you do if something was incorrect?*

I'd click on edit.

- *(after hitting edit button) is that what you expected would happen?*

It would take me back to that prompt to edit. 

I would say make it so it would bring you back to the screen to edit.

- *Do you know what happens after you hit submit?*

It would ask me are you sure. and it would tell me submitted.

**_Confirmation page_**
- *What is the purpose of this page?*


No I wasn't expecting to see a confirmation. I thought i'd see a prompt.



- *What would you do with this information?*


I would screenshot it and upload to the cloud to keep it on the safe file.

I would wait 2 months and start bothering people. I would go to the regional office. You can go there anytime and just bother those people.

- *What do you think will happen next?*
