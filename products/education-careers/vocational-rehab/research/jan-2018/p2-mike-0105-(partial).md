1. started an organization that became student veterans of america
2. heard about VR&E benefits from his registrar. deals with dozens of people every day who have no idea about VR&E benefits.
3. Uses vets.gov for document retrieval mainly - letters to employers, dealing with parks service to get a free pass to national parks
4. thinks people would usually be searching for "voc rehab", not VR&E. that's how they refer to it
5. Gravitated first to the blue box to find out about eligibility, read the points, then would look for a contact number
6. when directed to the wizard, thought it would "help someone sort out who they are". expected the wizard to just bring up the blue box about "if I'm a veteran, can I get VR&E benefits". didn't expect it to be a wizard, but then said it was nice when he saw how it worked
7. If someone had a "no" answer, expected people would leave the wizard and go somewhere else
8. People might Interpret "counseling" as maybe something for PTSD, may discourage them. Depending on who you're talking to. 24 year old maybe with a high school education recently coming out of service may not read it the way you intended
9. Thinks the two links after eligibility go to the same place. "I've always found the redundancy in government sites, some people don't see the button and just read the text. other people just see the button. think it's a good idea to give two options because they're not always looking"
10. Lots of changes in the big VA system, not necessarily VAHA or VABA
11. Application: First wanted to click the self-titled item in the breadcrumb, then scrolled and clicked "Start the VR&E application"
12. Sign in: I know what that is. You need a defense information systems account, an alternative to your CAP card. Have to go back in and get a DS (logon) account
    1. *Think you need an account to start the application?*
       1. Yeah
       2. This is where someone like me would need to hand carry a new applicant through the system. Getting an initial DS Logon account is a pain. That's not necessarily a VA problem, but echelons above reality
13. Expects to see step by step instructions for a 28-8-32
14. Most applicants will have no idea what their VA file number is.
15. Expected to list only the last term of service. 
    1. *directed to the "add another service period"*
    2. Oh, then you can add another one
16. Expected most of his info to be prefilled after he logged in, so he wouldn't have a need to review it
17. Expects that usually a counselor at a school is going through this application
    1. thought he was applying for eligibility for vocational rehab. Please have a counselor contact me. That's all this form does.
    2. *Next step*
       1. for one of his clients, he'd sit with a certifying official (at a school)
       2. applicant needs to reach out to a VR&E counselor if they haven't heard back in a timely manner
