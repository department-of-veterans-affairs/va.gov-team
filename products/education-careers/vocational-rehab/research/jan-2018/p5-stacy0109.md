### Warm-up questions

- *Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work)*

Born in Torrence, lived my life in long beach, enlisted at 17, delayed entry program,  enlisted as an infantry (?). I thought infantry was the way to go and would open up a career in law enforcement.

Realized its not the career I should have entered... (he faded away) 

Deployed to Iraq. It was a happy mistake because those guys were the best human beings I ever know.

Live in Georgia

Was in the army

- *What's your favorite thing about living in [place]?*



- *Have you used the VA for services before? If yes, which? If not, why not?*

primary care, all the medical care

pension

my wife and i are enrolled in VA health giver program

- *How do you access benefits? Do you use any online services to manage them? What was that experience like?*

We use myhealthyvet and ebenefits

- *Are you familiar with Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment services through the VA? Are you using those benefits? Do you plan to use those benefits in the future?*

I've heard about it, and that's pretty much as far as it goes.

I thought that's something i should do, but how to go about getting assitance or finding who to talk to (sounds like it was too much so he avoided it)

### Getting situated on Vets.gov

- *Have you ever used Vets.gov before?*

I can't recall if I've heard of it or not. Has the display page changed in the last couple months? Ah no i haven't used Vets.gov.

- *When you have questions about your VA benefits, where do you go to find information?*



### Finding out your eligibility 

Prototype: https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/KXF2UUB3H

*Feel free to take a minute to look around the eligibility page*

**_Prototype page 1_**
- *Read through the content in this page. How would you go about finding out whether or not you are eligible for VR&E benefits?*


VR&E… VR&E.. oh yeah it's the vocational rehab. Yeah i've heard of it. Again where to go, how to get it is hard for me.

I'm used to having it called voc rehab.



- *Who is eligible for VR&E benefits?*


(Asked to click on Veteran) I guess you click next. Oh it seems simple enough already. 

A little confused "Other than dishonorable"— took a little to realize 

Going through the wizard...

I got an upgrade in my disability rating in the last 12 years, i don't know if that qualifies?



- *What do you think would happen if you selected your service criteria and hit next?*




- *Why do you think you're being asked these questions?*

It's trying to figure out whether i'm eligible

- *How many more steps do you think there are before you find out whether or not you are eligible for VR&E benefits?*



- *What do you think would happen if you clicked "no" on discharge in past 12 years?*

I don't know. Maybe it could disqualify you. But i know people who've had voc rehab who have separate more than 12 years.

If i enter info that disqualify me, i would expect it to tell me that i don't qualify.

**_Last step - eligibility decision_**
- *Is this what you thought you would see here?*

Yeah i guess.

based on the information i put in it says i'm eligible. 

- *What else do you want to know about your eligibility now?*

The next thing for me would be to go ahead and click apply for counseling, i would just have to assume that I just follow the linear process on vets.gov. I think there will be a provider or clinician for evaluation how the benefits could assist me. Find stuck points I might have in areas like education or employment.

- *Does this information help you determine whether you are eligible for VR&E benefits?*



- *Do you have more information now than at the beginning of this process about whether or not you are eligible for VR&E benefits? If yes, what information?*

The only apprehension i would i have is if you're going to try to apply for the benefits via Vets.gov, and it says you're qualified, it's almost seems like you're trying to apply for something that you actually might not qualify. It would be disheartening.

From what it says "you may qualify". I guess i just have to go through this to figure out if i get voc rehab. 

I've seen people trying to get benefits they don't really need or don't really earn, it's a slap in my face. I guess if this requires me to put my best effort forward i'm ok with it.



I guess it would be helpful to have a thumbnail - i guess it depends on the length - if there are more qualifying factors that would solidify your qualification in the process. or on the other hand if you have disqualifying factors like dishonorable discharge, i think maybe put in those in a thumbnail somewhere so we can look through and say, ok yeah i qualify or not qualify.

(Aked where he would go to find ^^ information) Maybe i'll go to external resource (referring to a link on the left nav).. or maybe scroll down the page. Oh there you go. Yeah this is helpful!



- *What would you do next?*



- *What do you think you would see here if you weren't eligible?*



- *What would you do if you disagreed with this information?*



- *Do you feel that you have enough information to apply? If not, what else do you want to know? Where would you go to find that information?*



- *Where would you go to begin the application process, if you were ready to apply?*

Apply online link: automatic link to applying. I guess the apply online or apply for counseling i guess i confuse them for being the same. I think the apply online tab would redirect you to possibly a VA form online that you have to print and bring in to a VSO or somewhere in the VA to initiates the program.

When I see apply for counseling, I would assume that there is a program referral counselor, possibly they would contact a social worker, a social worker would go through the appropriate channel to set up an appointment.



- *What would you expect to happen if you clicked on [either call to action]? Did you notice the other link? If you clicked that link, what would you expect to happen?*

Just looking at it they look like they're 2 different things, one is apply online. the apply online is for applying for voc rehab.

The green button makes it look like it's the magical way to go.

Everytime i try to apply for something, it always ends up being a doc i have to print out. The only thing that's really online is just getting the document. I guess in heinsight, it would seem almost possible the application could be facilitated electronically via the internet. It would be a little weird for me. I would usualy go through both options.

*Ok, now we're going to look at the application for VR&E itself. Even though you're on a computer right now, I'm going to show you what the application would look like if you were applying using a mobile phone. Do you currently use a smartphone?*

### Apply for VR&E (Chapter 36)

Prototype: https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/G9F1A8U7K

**_Form landing page_**
- *What is the first thing you would do upon arriving on this page?*

I guess if you have the applicable software to save it… some adobe software lets you save it.

I guess the blue button.. ok that tells me i'm about to apply online.

I guess I would have to sign up for an account first. Usually what I would do is I see a start the VR&E application, I'll click that. It down the road if it asks me to sign in, I would.

- *Do you have enough information to begin the application?*



- *What information do you think you might find out if you scroll down?*



- *Is this what you were expecting to see?*

**_Interior pages_**
- *Were you expecting to be asked this information? (piece by piece)*

Step one: yes

Step two: I would fill in all the required data.

VA file number! Things I always feel confused… I still don't know my VA file number unless i check my ID

I know they require a SSN. I would just kind of assume they're checking my name against my SSN to verify the identity.

Step 3: I would personally click none. (Even though asked that he has medical benefits)

Step 4: Oh man I would have to go get my 214 to be able to enter all the dates in.

Step 5: Wow. I wouldn't expect to see "country". I guess I just have to enter USA. I would assume you have to be a citizen to aply.

I'm actually suprised to see the address and phone number are on a separate tab. I assume personal identifiable info would be on the same page. The blue progress bar makes it seem like this is all i gotta do. That's great.



What would you do to correct answer?

- *Why is the VA asking for this information?*



- *Do you have all the information you need to successfully apply for VR&E counseling?* 
- *Is there anything you see here that is confusing to you?*

**_Review page_**

- *How would you review the information you've entered?*

Pretty much seeing the culmination of your application online this far. I'd click on privacy policy and submit the application.

- *What would you do if something was incorrect?*

I would go through the individual tab, and I believe it would expand the section. I'd like on the plus sign. Wow it's actually really blunt - i'm not used to something like that. I can't believe it's so short I don't have to spend an hour and a half in front of the computer. 

- *(after hitting edit button) is that what you expected would happen?*
- *Do you know what happens after you hit submit?*

**_Confirmation page_**
- *What is the purpose of this page?*


Oh ok it gives me a confirmation number. That's good. 

I guess so as long as the receiving party of the application knows about the confirmation to verify someone's application. I've had a history of apply for something online and nobody knows about it. This confirmation number gives me some hope.

The VA uses one system for charting , the other used for xxx - depending on which system picks up the application it could be problematic. This confirmation number could be my proof. (Sounds like a lot of distrust to applying for VA benefits online)

- *What would you do with this information?*
- *What do you think will happen next?*


I'd click into "What happens after i apply" because i sure hate surprises. 

I expect to see what happens next. maybe where the application is sent to, regional office, or something. I kind of think the info they're after would just be that - nothing much further.

This is short and concise. Looks like it's going to work well.

Had some hesitation with the green button vs apply online, but overall was very very easy.

### Wrap-up

*Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us! Is there anything else you'd like to share with the team building Vets.gov based on your experiences today?*
