Chris L (hasnt used VR&amp;E) 

###Warm-up questions

Before we dig in on the site, I'd like to ask you a few questions so we get used to talking togther.

- *Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work)*

works at Microsoft, wife and 3 kids. goods lives in a nice neighborhood, comfortable talking to anybody

Was in marine corps for 13 years

Got out in oct 2015



- *What's your favorite thing about living in [place]?*
- *Have you used the VA for services before? If yes, which? If not, why not?*

used the VA loan, a little bit of GI bill a while back, haven't used VA healthcare

- *How do you access benefits? Do you use any online services to manage them? What was that experience like?*

I goes to ebenifits

- *Are you familiar with Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment services through the VA? Are you using those benefits? Do you plan to use those benefits in the future?*

i am. I applied for vocab rehab a couple months ago but had to cancel the appointment. i cancelled because i wasn't 100% sure i was worthy of using it. Someone else could use it better.

### Getting situated on Vets.gov

- *Have you ever used Vets.gov before?*

Just the session i've been to. I had started there a few times. I haven't clicked on there much.

- *When you have questions about your VA benefits, where do you go to find information?*

ebenfit. if i apply there the information will be there as well.

*Now I'm going to share my screen with you. You should see the Vets.gov homepage.* 

*[Moderator shares screen]*

### Finding out your eligibility 

Prototype: https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/KXF2UUB3H

Feel free to take a minute to look around the eligibility page

_Prototype page 1_
- *Read through the content in this page. How would you go about finding out whether or not you are eligible for VR&E benefits?*

(asked to scroll down to the blue box)

it's pretty much self explanatory that... hey look if you fit this criteria you're eligible. 

He wants to click on one of the radio buttons.

I'll hit the Veteran radio button and it will tell me what I need to be eligible.



- *Who is eligible for VR&E benefits?*



- *What do you think would happen if you selected your service criteria and hit next?*

No this is not what i expect to see but if it is set up that way like a wizard that would be nice.

i had a horrible discharge

now it seems like it would alleviate any confusion whether i'm eligible or not

you cashe the information so i don't have to remember what answers i have given

*Continue to allow the participant to go through the eligibility wizard.*
- *Why do you think you're being asked these questions?*

just looking at it without reading into it, do i meet this or this or this and you may forget one thing but I can read at the list below to make sure i'm eligible. it seems like it is a little bit easier than having to read through the whole page on eligibility questions.

- *How many more steps do you think there are before you find out whether or not you are eligible for VR&E benefits?*

I don't know- maybe 3 or more.

The more is better- i guess it can be granular -getting the major questions answered will tell me whether i'm eligible. 

- *What do you think would happen if you clicked "no" on discharge in past 12 years?*

I think it would tell me i'm not eligible but here are the other benefits you might be eligible to

I'm at 30% and i separate in the last 4 years.





_Last step - eligibility decision_

- *Is this what you thought you would see here?*

Yes! It'd be good to see what the next steps are. i've done this part, i've spoken to the counselor on the phone. It'd be nice to get multiple means of communication from the couselor.

how did you get that number? the phone number was on the email. or maybe from the office when i was there, i wasn't 100% sure.

- *What else do you want to know about your eligibility now?*
- *Does this information help you determine whether you are eligible for VR&E benefits?*

I think so.

why? you just answer the questions on the wizard. if you scroll down all the answers are probably in that eligibility info. this is easier. 

i work on the computer everyday, but for other people who don't work on the computer, the wizard makes it more organized and easier

that's pretty awesome i like things like that so i can focus on what question i need answer. that's good.

- *Do you have more information now than at the beginning of this process about whether or not you are eligible for VR&E benefits? If yes, what information?*

I think so. i think the next step for the apply is the xxx information. anybody can put anything in there. counselor can verify information and eligibility.

- *What would you do next?*
- *What do you think you would see here if you weren't eligible?*

Hey you're not eligible. here are the reasons why. you don'y match the disability rating or its been too long since you got out. something in that nature. here are other benefits that might be available for you. theres a lot of programs out there that i don't know. i would just expect to see why.

i heard about vr&e from a friend. I heard about it 3~4 months ago.

it would have been nice - i think all this information is readily available online.

it's pretty clear to me.



do you have enough info to figure out which to click on?

yeah i think it is pretty well written. It tells me to apply for counseling first. but it doesn't stop me from applying online.

- *What would you do if you disagreed with this information?*
- *Do you feel that you have enough information to apply? If not, what else do you want to know? Where would you go to find that information?*
- *Where would you go to begin the application process, if you were ready to apply?*
- *What would you expect to happen if you clicked on [either call to action]? Did you notice the other link? If you clicked that link, what would you expect to happen?*

did you notice there's a second link - yes. i'm pretty sure it'll bring me to a form. i don't know what the apply for counseling does. It might take me to a page to apply online for a phone number to a counselor.

*Ok, now we're going to look at the application for VR&E itself. Even though you're on a computer right now, I'm going to show you what the application would look like if you were applying using a mobile phone. Do you currently use a smartphone?*

### Apply for VR&E (Chapter 36)

Prototype: https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/G9F1A8U7K

_Form landing page_
- *What is the first thing you would do upon arriving on this page?*

I'd scroll down and read the blue box. then i'd hit start the vr& e. 

I would read the information below. you have all this information right here, i'm pretty sure it'll be at the bottom as well. ok cool it has a button at the bottom. my concern is when you have the button on the top, people will click on it without knowing all the information below. well now you can save the application it's ok.

i think i'll be able to sign in later in the process.

what if you don't have an account? I'm pretty sure it'll let me register for an account 

- *Do you have enough information to begin the application?*
- *What information do you think you might find out if you scroll down?*
- *Is this what you were expecting to see?*



having read through the info i would start 

_Interior pages_
- *Were you expecting to be asked this information? (piece by piece)*

kind of. ther are a lot of radio buttons. the least amount of typing the better.

how many more steps? there there are square so about 5 more steps.

some peple just don' like using their keyboard. if you're signed in i expect some of the info will be taken care of.

iyou'll just double check to make sure all the prefill info is correct. i expect not all fields are filled. I would then hit continue when everything is ready to go.

If you sign in will you have to type all this information? 



step 3: those look like commonly used benefits. i guess it's not about whether i expect to see but it's nice to see. if i haven't used it maybe the counselor and tell me to go use them.

what does veterans' education assistanceâ€¦ mean? it could mean the GI bill or the education benefits i may have received during active service - 4k a year for college classes. I'm not sure what this mean. gi bill or post 911 gi bill. i don't know.

have you heard of chap 31? No. I'm pretty sure it's what we're applying for. I think it's fine maybe you know it as a different name. Maybe it's making sure i'm applying for something i've already done.. it's easier for the counselor to see.



what other info is waiting?

probably disability rating, discharge status, maybe address and zipcode. are you currently employed for in college that kind of question.



yeah i expect to see military stuff. it's a bit more in depth than i expected. but yeah pretty much what I was thinking.

do you have readily available dates? i remember my month and day. i know on my dd214. it's kind of tricky if i have multiple services you'd have multi[ple dd214/]. i don't have them readily available unless i go to my dd214.

what would happen if you click add another service period? if would open the same set of questions. you keep adding 



step 5: yeah i expect to see this. this is how they match me to a counselor. i know having done this through eben i got something in the mail. i did notice a 5.1 - i'm sure i'll see 5.2 where it asks me phone number and email. 

why do you think they broke this step into multiple? maybe they want to keep the page short and simple. 

yeah it's basically what i was thinking about. 

what more info were you thinking about? that's pretty much, just email and phone.

- *Why is the VA asking for this information?*
- *Do you have all the information you need to successfully apply for VR&E counseling?* 
- *Is there anything you see here that is confusing to you?*

_Review page_
- *How would you review the information you've entered?*

go through and click on the plus marks and review all the info. I imagine if there is mistake you can change those answers.

- *What would you do if something was incorrect?*

yeah you can just hit edit. i'm sure it's gonna let me edit in step or take me back to the page.

i wouldn't read the privacy policy.

- *(after hitting edit button) is that what you expected would happen?*
- *Do you know what happens after you hit submit?*

if i didn't check the box, it wouldn't allow me to submit.

once i hit submit i expect to be sent of to whichever counselor out there. we'll contact you in xx days. i expect to see something in the mail. or email, or someone calls me.

_Confirmation page_
- *What is the purpose of this page?*


yeah basically this says we may contact you. you can at least call back if you don't hear back and tell them this information.



any info you want to know? no. 

will it send me an email? i put my email in there. i expect to see an email confirmation. so it's readily searchable. if i lose the page i print out i still have the email.

- *What would you do with this information?*
- *What do you think will happen next?*


### Wrap-up

*Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us! Is there anything else you'd like to share with the team building Vets.gov based on your experiences today?*

*Thank you gift*



no. it looks really good. almost intuitive. hopefully that translates to better servicec for the guys out there that need it.
