Phil C (used VR&amp;E) 

### Warm-up questions

- *Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work)*

served 7 year 2008-2015

currently at harvard doing law school and biz school

enrolled in vr&e, before this GI bill

- *What's your favorite thing about living in [place]?*



- *Have you used the VA for services before? If yes, which? If not, why not?*

disability comp

enrolled in medical care. haven't sought much on that.

- *How do you access benefits? Do you use any online services to manage them? What was that experience like?*

ebenefits

he uses it to apply for benefits if he has to, but doesn't use it to manage his benefits much

- *Are you familiar with Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment services through the VA? Are you using those benefits? Do you plan to use those benefits in the future?*

One of his fellow veterans at school told him about it.

he was talking to this friend about how to pay for school, and the friend told him that he's getting his paid for through vr&e. He was able to get the equivalent or better than the GI bill because he has higher disability. 

The biggest factor that made me apply is my yellow room (?) program doesn't cover the full tuition fee but vocational rehab does. 

he started voc rehab spring 2017. there was only 1 term he had gi bill and paid out of pocket for the different.

### Getting situated on Vets.gov

- *Have you ever used Vets.gov before?*

I think that came out more recently right? I don't think so.



- *When you have questions about your VA benefits, where do you go to find information?*

I usually just google it. Mostly i find information I get from people blogging/articles easier to understand than VA information. For ex, i didn't even know voc rehab existed. Finding out from my friend or google was more helpful than the VA transition services.

### Finding out your eligibility 

Prototype: https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/KXF2UUB3H

*Feel free to take a minute to look around the eligibility page*

**_Prototype page 1_**
- *Read through the content in this page. How would you go about finding out whether or not you are eligible for VR&E benefits?*


he would go to the gray box and click on one of the options and click next.

- *Who is eligible for VR&E benefits?*




- *What do you think would happen if you selected your service criteria and hit next?*


I think there would be follow up questions.

I would get more specific questions.

Clicking on the gray box is the path to the least resistence. Although having the blue box is a great way to gather a few pieces of quick info to verify what I heard from google is accurate. 

With the gray box, i would be concerned about clicking in the wrong thing. government services is unforgiving, it takes months to fix and might hurt me in the future. what are the ramification of clicking on the wrong answer? Will I be ineligible? 

Opportunity: instruction that this isn't going to be recorded and no ramifications of eligibility down the road.



Yeah this is what i expect to see. something like this.



Anything other than dishonorable: this is a double negative. he clicked on the wrong one to find out he isn't eligible.

he suggested asking What type of discharge do you have and select an option. but realizes that creates another set of questions.

- *Why do you think you're being asked these questions?*

On the disability rating screen: yes expected to be asked these questions

I'm assuming your benefits is only good if you've been separated in the last 12 years.

I would expect there to be more criteria questions than this. 

- *How many more steps do you think there are before you find out whether or not you are eligible for VR&E benefits?*

  ​



- *What do you think would happen if you clicked "no" on discharge in past 12 years?*

**_Last step - eligibility decision_**
- *Is this what you thought you would see here?*

I'm confused as what it means to apply for counseling. I thought voc rehab was to get school and career help, why do I need counseling?

It's a negative word so they don't realize that they're just applying to meet with a counselor to create a plan.

"Advising" sounds less threatening than counseling.

Most vets think that I have psychological or marriage trouble so i need counseling. Advising is more academic.

It would be good to have a step by step: this is the info you gave us, this is what you might be eligible for. If step 1 is to meet with a counselor, then call it out - make it clear what the purpose of this is.

2nd link - what does a counseling do for me? what does the application do? I'd have some confusion. it sorted of imply that counseling is not the benefit so i'd probably click on the blue link.

- *What else do you want to know about your eligibility now?*
- *Does this information help you determine whether you are eligible for VR&E benefits?*
- Do you have more information now than at the beginning of this process about whether or not you are eligible for VR&E benefits? If yes, what information?
- *What would you do next?*
- *What do you think you would see here if you weren't eligible?*
- *What would you do if you disagreed with this information?*
- *Do you feel that you have enough information to apply? If not, what else do you want to know? Where would you go to find that information?*
- *Where would you go to begin the application process, if you were ready to apply?*
- *What would you expect to happen if you clicked on [either call to action]? Did you notice the other link? If you clicked that link, what would you expect to happen?*

*Ok, now we're going to look at the application for VR&E itself. Even though you're on a computer right now, I'm going to show you what the application would look like if you were applying using a mobile phone. Do you currently use a smartphone?*

### Apply for VR&E (Chapter 36)

Prototype: https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/G9F1A8U7K

**_Form landing page_**
- *What is the first thing you would do upon arriving on this page?*

Look for a button to apply - would click on the blue button

Only if I didn't know anything about what I was doing - otherwise I dont read the instruction

expect to see personal info, specific school they have in mind, financial information…etc.

- *Do you have enough information to begin the application?*



- *What information do you think you might find out if you scroll down?*



- *Is this what you were expecting to see?*
- ​

**_Interior pages_**
- *Were you expecting to be asked this information? (piece by piece)*

Looking around at page 2: he'd be looking for a DS log on so all the info would be prefilled.

All the information makes sense.

Feels comfortable giving these information.

Step 3: if you previously applied for voc rehab it makes sense to me that they wouldn't want you to apply again. It'd probably be an application killer. None i'm assuming this is your first time applying so you would proceed to the next page.

Other: i guess it could link your accounts to other benefits.

Step 4: Again, i would like one profile to log in to so all this would be auto populated.

Anybody who's used any benefits need to put in their service dates, so they have this information on hand.

expects that adding another service perioud would open up a set of the same field

Step 5: yes understands why being asked about contact info.

seeing 5.1: there must be 10 steps instead of 5!

thinks there would be more questions around program you're interested in, geographical area you intend to go to…etc.

5.2: don't know why the contact information is split up

He expects more biographical information. I don't have any specific. 

Doesn't expect to review his application at this point. the 5.1, 5.2…made him feel that there would be a lot more.

What heppens when edit:  he expects to change the info he has put in. expects to be able to edit everything on this page.

- *Why is the VA asking for this information?*



- *Do you have all the information you need to successfully apply for VR&E counseling?* 



- *Is there anything you see here that is confusing to you?*

**_Review page_**
- *How would you review the information you've entered?*

purpose of this page: making sure the application is submitted.

I wouldn't do anything with this page.

I'm usually satisfied after i see a page like this. I might create a pdf so if i don't hear back at least i have this confirmation number.

Tells his personal story: I applied for retroactive reimbursement and sat down with a couselor. The counselor left and never submitted my application. 

If i don't hear back within the process time they promise, I might give them a call.

I expect that I will get an email - we approved, denied..etc and the next steps.

- *What would you do if something was incorrect?*



- *(after hitting edit button) is that what you expected would happen?*
- *Do you know what happens after you hit submit?*

**_Confirmation page_**
- *What is the purpose of this page?*
- *What would you do with this information?*
- *What do you think will happen next?*
