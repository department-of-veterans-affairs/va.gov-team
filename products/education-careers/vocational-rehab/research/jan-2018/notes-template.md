**_Last step - eligibility decision_**
- *Is this what you thought you would see here?*
- *What else do you want to know about your eligibility now?*
- *Does this information help you determine whether you are eligible for VR&E benefits?*
- Do you have more information now than at the beginning of this process about whether or not you are eligible for VR&E benefits? If yes, what information?
- *What would you do next?*
- *What do you think you would see here if you weren't eligible?*
- *What would you do if you disagreed with this information?*
- *Do you feel that you have enough information to apply? If not, what else do you want to know? Where would you go to find that information?*
- *Where would you go to begin the application process, if you were ready to apply?*
- *What would you expect to happen if you clicked on [either call to action]? Did you notice the other link? If you clicked that link, what would you expect to happen?*

*Ok, now we're going to look at the application for VR&E itself. Even though you're on a computer right now, I'm going to show you what the application would look like if you were applying using a mobile phone. Do you currently use a smartphone?*
