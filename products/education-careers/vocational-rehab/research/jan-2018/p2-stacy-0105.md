- *How do you access benefits? Do you use any online services to manage them? What was that experience like?*

pharmacy to helping people find 214, set up appts, 

it's amazing now many vet come off active duty and have no idea how eben works. they don't even know what's there .

he's famliar with eben

- *Are you familiar with Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment services through the VA? Are you using those benefits? Do you plan to use those benefits in the future?*

how long have you been using it? from 2006-2008 as a client. when i did graduate they helped me with a paid internship until the uni could create a payroll position for me.

how you first found out? from registrar from the u of iowa. they asked why aren't you using it? he didn't even know he was eligible.

do lots of people come to you? i see dozens of people everyday that don't know it exists.

### Getting situated on Vets.gov

- *Have you ever used Vets.gov before?*

yes all he time

document retrievement. 



receiving xxx to get a discount to go to the national park.

there's not a lot of overlap btn state and federal license. you have to physically print things out.

- *When you have questions about your VA benefits, where do you go to find information?*



### Finding out your eligibility 

Prototype: https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/KXF2UUB3H

*Feel free to take a minute to look around the eligibility page*

**_Prototype page 1_**
- *Read through the content in this page. How would you go about finding out whether or not you are eligible for VR&E benefits?*


Someone would have to know to even look for vr&e as a buzzword. 

they would prob be looking for vob rehab, those don't ususally come up in the search engine.

the highlighted block says eligibility- younger vets should probably be able to figure it out. Older vets need us to walk them through.

- *Who is eligible for VR&E benefits?*


veterans, outgoing members and their spouse. 

Looking like you spell out everything below.

I would click into the Veteran page and read the information. I would say I probably am eligible. I would be looking for apply here button or contact us.

I thikn the grey box lets the individuals sort out who they are. 



- *What do you think would happen if you selected your service criteria and hit next?*


they would click because they identify with all those words. I think if i click on veteran it would show me all the information below.



This is not what I expect but this is good! This is a screening process. 

- *Why do you think you're being asked these questions?*
- *How many more steps do you think there are before you find out whether or not you are eligible for VR&E benefits?*

Probably 3. Why? 1 do you have a honorable discharge, 2 what is disability rating, then 3 maybe asking if they need education, employment, now what?

What 12 year? i think it's because there is a cap on how many you can help. i think we have updated policy to include older discharge.

I always wonder about the 12 year limit. gi bill went from 12 to 15 and got lifted. Wondering if chap 31 should lift that cap to match the gi bill.



with no disability i think they click out and go somewhere else

- *What do you think would happen if you clicked "no" on discharge in past 12 years?*

i think it would be a turn off and they would go somewhere else.



next would be asking me about education information or employment.

**_Last step - eligibility decision_**
- *Is this what you thought you would see here?*

Yeah. it's telling me to fill out the paperwork see if we could get you benefits. 

they assume counseling is for ptsd it may discourage them. it does say vocational and education, but depending on who you takj to it could mean a lot of different things.

What info would make it clear? I think just apply here would make it straightforward enough. 

(2 links) I bet they both go to the same link. 

I've always found the redundency on government sites. some people don't see the button and look for text. some people don't read and click on buttons. it's not a bad thing since we have a wide range of participants looking.

if not eligible, i want to see referal to other places. maybe gi bill page, therapy… i don't know. it depends on what cause them to not be eligible.



- *What else do you want to know about your eligibility now?*
- *Does this information help you determine whether you are eligible for VR&E benefits?*

Yes 

- Do you have more information now than at the beginning of this process about whether or not you are eligible for VR&E benefits? If yes, what information?
- *What would you do next?*

i would click on the green box or the application process on the left.

- *What do you think you would see here if you weren't eligible?*
- *What would you do if you disagreed with this information?*
- *Do you feel that you have enough information to apply? If not, what else do you want to know? Where would you go to find that information?*
- *Where would you go to begin the application process, if you were ready to apply?*
- *What would you expect to happen if you clicked on [either call to action]? Did you notice the other link? If you clicked that link, what would you expect to happen?*

*Ok, now we're going to look at the application for VR&E itself. Even though you're on a computer right now, I'm going to show you what the application would look like if you were applying using a mobile phone. Do you currently use a smartphone?*

### Apply for VR&E (Chapter 36)

Prototype: https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/G9F1A8U7K

**_Form landing page_**
- *What is the first thing you would do upon arriving on this page?*

near the top it says apply online. it seems to be the link. or down below.

ok yeah start the vr&e application.

sign in to an account could be problematic. unless we have set up and account during transition they're not gonna have one.

you'll need an alternative to cap card. defense information systems account which is a fairly time consuming. once you're approved for mhv you need to go back to get a ds account.

i think this is where service officers and folks like me and collegeate school certifying people need to hand hold the applicants to the process. getting the initial DS logon is a pain. 

- *Do you have enough information to begin the application?*

yes 

- *What information do you think you might find out if you scroll down?*

step by step instruction.

- *Is this what you were expecting to see?*

Yes 

I read through al my forms before i start.

Anything new on this page? not really



Separation date, character of discharge, physical rating is, why are you applying? what do you want vr&e to do for you? starting a biz is different from getting an english degree. they tend to ask what is this degree gonna do for you. 

**_Interior pages_**
- *Were you expecting to be asked this information? (piece by piece)f*

I was actually expecting to see the basics like name and address

if no- it would take you back to the beginning because you're filling out all the wrong form.

oh there it is all the PII!

Most applicants have no idea what their VA file number is. It's on top of the doc you get from the VA that identify you. 

It says 6 steps so should be 4 more.

step 3: no it's no unexpect. do you have a record in our system. 

second checkbox: it's one of the 6 gi bill variance -  Montgomery, post 9-11…etc. 

Why is it asking for chap 31: this is the first time it's come up on this page - they may not have any idea they already applied for chap 31. so the VA can pull up their application.

What qualifies as other? oh my goodness it could be housing, sth in the medical field, anywhere. should we already know if you're in the system. if it is other - i would get another screen that lists other options… home loan, MHV, aid and attendance…etc who knows? maybe your kids are using your benefits….etc



step 4: yes. this is part of that basic PII. 

do most people have their dates availalbe? he remembers right out of him mind. Most of us know those numbers. or it's on their dd214.

if they have multiple, i'd fill out the most recent.

the latest dd214 would take into account the multiple 

add another period would allow me to fill out all my periods.

if you do reserve you get multiple 214s, it's hard to have one document for all the accumulative information. 

Vr&e counselor fresh out of college may not have that information.

they should be able to go to eben site to pull out their service periods.

Step 5: yes. this is still basic identification stuff. 

did you notice 5.1? yes because there is not enough room

but this page should be with step 2. it is an appropriate question it is just out of sequence. 

on next page.. possinly pin data. (??) 

you're still asking for basic contact information. it's clear why they ask this it's because the counselor needs to get ahold of you. but i still want all the basic identity info group together. 

at some point you're going to ask about spouse, dependet information.





- *Why is the VA asking for this information?*
- *Do you have all the information you need to successfully apply for VR&E counseling?* 
- *Is there anything you see here that is confusing to you?*

**_Review page_**



Review: i don't expect to see this but it's good to review.

Read this. submit it. 

personally i don't review it because a lot of mine would have gone in via auto fill.

I don't tend to read privacy and they're all boiler plate. 

I would hit edit button and it would take me to the particular sub-section. and it would let me submit again and take me back to this page.

submit would take me to the next steps.

- *How would you review the information you've entered?*
- *What would you do if something was incorrect?*
- *(after hitting edit button) is that what you expected would happen?*
- *Do you know what happens after you hit submit?*

**_Confirmation page_**
- *What is the purpose of this page?*


the claim did go forward. you have a date of claim.

this is the date they have to back date to.

- *What would you do with this information?*


they would print if off and stick it in the file

or write the number down

- *What do you think will happen next?*


somewhere between 30-90 days from now they would hear back from somebody. if not heard back they would call the number down below.

when someone is doing this they have already talked to a counselor and told to fill this out. there is a human in the loop somewhere that should be checking on all these things. students do go through the entire semester without being paid.

eligibility for vocational rehab. you haven't said if i'm applying for school or employment. all this does is to have someone contact me. 

for one of my clients i would be sitting down with the school official to make sure the curriculum…etc. if they're applying for work they would apply for chap 31. chap 31 would pay them while they're learning.

depending where you are the vr&e counselor , school and employer all have to coordinate for this Veteran.

### Wrap-up

*Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us! Is there anything else you'd like to share with the team building Vets.gov based on your experiences today?*



At U of Iowa master and phd we have counseling students work wtih vba abd vha and school officials. by the time they graduate they would have seen 2 out of the 3 big VA facets. I don't know many other school that do this kind of training. Most of them know nothing about how the VA functions and it's the individual Veterans that suffer.
