VR&E - Olivia:

Army reserves 07-11; deployed Iraq 09-10. Retired because married + babies. Got a Bachelor’s with REAP and Post-9/11 GI Bill. Was looking into going back to school, so “VR&E is actually really good information to go over.” 

* Currently a VSO. Left the water industry. Degree in geology. “Left to help Veterans.”

Q: As a VSO, what do you do with Veternas/

* Help vets and their families nav benefits and resources local, state, fed level. Sometimes claimants aren’t vets (“and their families”).
* Get them in touch with everything that’s available to them.

Q: Have you helped with VR&E?

* Sometimes someone will come in with service-connected issues saying they can’t work and want to go back to school, so she’s walked them through eBen and VR&E which is a simple 1-button. Let them know someone will be reaching out and that there are further steps. Let them know there are state benefits they may be eligible. “As far as VR&E goes, we just help them apply over eBenefits.”
* When they need more info: “A lot of our jb is helping them get into the health administration, get benefits going on the benefit administration. Sometimes the education can be a little tricky. So we usually try to refer to the counselors that are up there.” “It is very hard to get a hold dof an actual person at the office.”
* If there are any questions we go to va.gov or eBen to look at general info. But try to encourage asking their counselor specific questions.
* “Um Vets.gov is kind of popping up for some things that our Veterans can use…I think I’ve actually walked someone through Vets.gov in applying for healthcare….every so often it’ll pop up. Check out our new site, vets.gov! Don’t really use it unless it’s the healthcare. I don’t know what’s available on there, it’s not 100% going from what I understand.”
* “I like that you have men and women on [the homepage]…diversify.”
* “Down here, it just shows what’s available to people. And it’s called Vets.gov! Pretty simple, that it’s geared to Veterans.” 
* Goes to explore benefits > edu & training. “Oh, you don’t have VR&E on here! I’m pretty lucky that I was a VA work-study student so I’d know to go under GI Bill…” but others wouldn’t know that. So maybe she’d go into education benefits? 
* Might not hurt to have it listed under careers and employment too. “Why not cover all grounds and show that it can be considered education, or a subset of a disability compensated issue?”

Q: did you expect VR&E under edu & training? 
* “I guess….” The language they use when someone comes in saying they can’t work is “let’s get you educated and trained in something new.”
* “I would expect to see it in this section (edu & training). I feel like it’s a subset of that category.”

Q: On VR&E — how does this connect with your understanding of who’s eligible?

* Reads through content. “I want to say that it’s pretty obvious that you’re gearing to towards Veterans with service-connected disability. It says _right there_ ‘find out if you’re eligible and how to apply.’”
* “I think that’s a really good paragraph. It’s short, sweet, and tells you what’s available and to whom.”

Q: If you wanted to find out if someone’s elibitle, where would you click?

* Eligibility - clicks.
* “Would it make more sense to switch this Veteran and Servicemember? I don’t know what your statistics are, but if your’ seeing more veterans using this than service members…they may get discouraged reading 20% or higher, oh, that’s not me, I’m only 10%.”
* “If you’re seeing more Veterans, I would even put Veterans [first].”
* “I know some people would read this [servicemembers] and just STOP.” 
* I see the words servicemember and veterans so often that I almost thought Veterans. I’m sure other people make that mistake.
* “You hear people say ‘servicemembers’ and maybe they’re lumping [everyone in to that one category.]”
* Service members call themselves…? “Active duty…?” “I just referred to myself as active duty right now. I’m on titled orders, I’m on a deployment, considered active duty. Cause then you also hear people say our service men and women, and I would just think that means everyone who’s served.” Past and present-tense.
* The bold ‘and’ is a really great way to indicate that this isn’t the end-all-be-all — it indicates that there are more criteria.
* “People truly get turned off when they read and they hear the word ‘no.’ They get discouraged, and there’s so much out there that you’re still eligible for.”
* Otherwise, the blue box makes sense. Has no questions. “But the ‘also’ could be bolded. It encourages people to keep reading.”

Q: Do you have enough info to begin the application?

* I feel like I have enough info to decide whether someone is a good candidate to apply or not.
* “It makes sense on the Veteran level, and then also on the VSO level.”

Q: Can you get a sense of what programs are avail through VR&E?

* “On this whole page? Kinda sorta. Not really detailed information….just from experience…I feel that they do send you to school, evaluate your situation to see if your disabilities are hindering your [ability to work]…” they’ll send you to school if they think you can be retrained, and that vibe isn’t coming through on this page. 
* “This is my bad…I could have just scrolled down a little more to see what services are here but it just didn’t jump out at me.”
* In the headline, because it says eligibility, that’s what I’m expecting. Maybe there’s another page about what is VR&E? “An about us section. This is what we do.” 
* “I don’t know if this is a privacy thing, but success stories — if the person signs off on it — how VR&E helped them…but I figured this was _just_ the eligibility page.”
* Maybe you could have a program section, and it goes into the services for each program?
* “We get a general idea of these tracks, as you call it, but I don’t know [this terminology] off the top of my head. I don’t do a lot of VR&E, we do a lot of pensions and compensation.”
* “I wouldn’t have known any of these [by these names] but the fact that you have this here is kind of nice.”
* I wouldn’t know which one to go to for myself or for someone else to “inquire about this …track.” Would send someone to their counselor to determine what’s best for them. A subject-matter expert to hone in on what’s best for them. “I don’t know that I could even figure out what’s best for me.” “But it’s nice that you have this here.”
* In short: the track names aren’t a known quantity to her — she’d send people to another counselor.
* Would like to see a chat function, or a preliminary “oh it sounds like you may be eligible for self-employment track! We encourage you to apply! But don’t eliminate your other options.”
* “I think a chat feature would be wonderful. I think a chat feature should be on the whole VA website. I’m sure it would be busy! It’s nice to get those quick answers, especially if people just _don’t know- and they get discouraged with an overwhelming amount of information. Or you could have your local VR&E office there, and you could have it go to a phone number.” 
* “People think for VA locations, that it’s VA medical centers. We kind of joke about it — the VA told me this, ok but which administration told you what?” 
* “Maybe have something like you could contact your local vr&e office.”
* “I’m trying to find one that would apply to me…maybe this? [looking through tracks]”
* “I think when people think ‘vocational’ they’re thinking…painter, welder. But I’m going to click [employment through long-term services.]”
* “I would choose this one for me, I think it might be closest to what I would personally do.” 
* Because ‘service-connected.’ “I don’t know why I chose that one, but I didn’t choose self-employment because I don’t want to do a business. Independent living I think seniors…re-employment [doesn’t apply to me] because I’ve been out of the service for a while. It’d have been great when I got out of service.”
* “I’m maybe looking for new skills.” It was a process of elimination — she went to all the ones that _didn’t_ match and picked the one that sort of did.

Q: At what point in the process are people eligible for these services? Do you apply for VR&E first, or the track first?
* “We always tell people to apply for voc rehab, because you’re going to go talk to a counselor anyway.” And then if it’s not a good fit there are maybe other things that do fit.
* “I don’t know which you have to apply for first [track or vr&e] to be quite honest with you.”
* “VR&E…it sounds like you have to apply for that before you can get on one of the tracks.”
* Finds the line about being enrolled in VR&E (it’s in the blue box) but it took a minute.
* “I think an apply button should be…oh, there it is! A little bit far down, but that’s ok.”
* “Is it something you could have in the sidebar, with a contact us or apply now? Just to make it easily accessible.”
* Is this what you expected to see? > Reads to herself. “I don’t think ‘get more information’ should be maybe this high up? Because you have what kind of benefits and then how can I get these benefits in the middle. I feel like that would go hand in hand. So maybe even having those [side by side]” 
* “I dont’ want to offend anyone…but this is very much just list. A long list. Just keeps going, and it keeps going….I’m ok with it, but it’s a lot of info, just to keep going and scrolling down.”
* “After I find out everything [about this] then I would care about more information, not mid-stream.”

Q: Anything that feels extraneous on this page? 
* “A lot of benefits can go hand in hand, and it’s really interesting to see how one can affect the other….everything is intertwined. I don’t ever see …too much. I mean there can be too much. This isn’t too much though. Just this get more information, I would put it lower.”

Q: if you wanted to go to another track, where would you go?
* Scrolls to the grey box at the bottom of the page and picks…”what jobs can I get that matches the skills I already have” — Rapid Access to Employment

Q: Read the blue box pls, is this what you expected?
* “You have to enroll in vr&e. I already have education experience and training…maybe my service connected issues are hindering that. This is spot-on.”
* Next would probably have to apply. “An apply button somewhere? It’s probably lower. Career counseling…resume…” Not a fan of the “more information.” But would go to the apply button if she wanted to do this.

Q: Where would you go to find out if a family member was eligible for VR&E? 
* Clicks learn about services for fam link at the bottom the page.

Q: Who is eligible for benefits?
* “I would have to say …just because I have a general idea…it’s pretty obvious up here that it’s for survivors and dependents. And you have…what, 5 bullets of criteria for who may be eligible. I would always encourage people to apply for it and let the VA tell you no, but this is a really good [quick run through].”
* “Apparently though you have to be participating in 35 to get 36…OR! There’s an or. Nevermind.”
* “I don’t know…does the VR&E office do the counseling for this? Fro Chatper 33 for a dependent? That’s actually great.” 
* “Sometimes transfer of post-9/11 can be a little hairy, sot hat’s fantastic that there’s SMEs available. Again, how do I contact one?”

Q: How do these chapters and their names factor into how you talk about these benefits?
* “If I ever refer to them I say post-9/11 or chapter 33, Montgomery GI Bill…but Voc Rehab, we seldom call it Chapter 35. We always refer to it as Voc Rehab. Is it even considered a GI Bill?” 
* “We call it Post-9/11 or chapter33, whatever one you know it by.”
* “Again because I know the apply button is down here — I still think it’d be nice to have it higher up.”

Q: Is it clear who has to apply?

* Reads to herself. “It sounds like…either the dependent OR the veteran can apply. Actually, I don’t know. Let me look. I want to see what you guys have here.” Scrolls on the page. 
* “If the Veteran is still alive we always put stuff under the Veteran’s info, but if it’s the dependent applying…I’m going to say it’s not jumping out at me.”
* “I’m excited to see this come up 100% and eBenefits probably go away! I like the Vets.gov title. It’s super easy and it’ll be nice once all this is 100%.”
