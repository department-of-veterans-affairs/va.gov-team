# VR&E Research Findings

## Where should it be?

- Two participants looked at Education first, then Careers. All talked about Disability as another place they might look if it weren't under those two.
- One participant looked at Careers first, then education, since he thinks about Voc Rehab as looking for a skill coming out of the service.
- Participants looked for "training" as a keyword—"you're being educated and trained in something new"



## Is eligibility clear?

- Participants did not remark on "servicemember" at the top of blue box. One of two things happened: 
  - The participant believed that benefits under "servicemember" were those that would apply to veterans. 
  - The participant saw "servicemember" and said "this doesn't apply to me." "I didn't pick up on that this is for veterans too."
  - A participant who is a VSO said she sees "Servicemembers and Veterans" together so often she assumed it was just a blanket term
- One participant said he would need to start the application process to determine eligibility. 
- It was clear to all that a service-related disability would be required.
  - For someone who had not yet been given a disability rating, the percentage ratings cited would be unclear. One Veteran who was 100% disabled referred to friends who were injured "at T11 or higher," but didn't know how that translated to a percentage rating.
- Chapter numbers were unfamiliar to both veterans. The VSO refers to benefits by name, and will occasionally throw in the chapter number if the Veteran in question is more familiar with them.

## Tracks

- The VSO was not familiar with the track names.
- It was unclear to one veteran how the "independent living" track fit within the other tracks.
- Track descriptions were pivotal.
  - VSO wanted to follow "Employment through long-term services" by process of elimination: "I didn’t choose self-employment because I don’t want to do a business. Independent living I think seniors…re-employment [doesn’t apply to me] because I’ve been out of the service for a while. It’d have been great when I got out of service."
  - "Vocational" often implies a profession like a painter or a welder
  - "Right to return" to a job reads as something involving the law
- It was not clear, either immediately or upon subsequent re-reads of the eligibility and application criteria, whether Veterans could apply directly to a track.
- It was not clear whether Veterans were stuck in one track or could be encouraged to follow another.
- One participant had short-term memory difficulties; for him in particular, it was especially important for track descriptions to be extensive and accurate so he didn't have to return to the list.

## Family member eligibility

- This was not clear to either Veteran. One assumed these benefits would apply to a family member of a Veteran who was themself also a Veteran.
- It is unclear as to whether the Veteran or the family member has to log into eBenefits and apply.



## Other information

- One Veteran is 100% disabled. He believes that VR&E is intended to place people back in the workforce, which would require him to give up his Social Security disability benefits. "I can’t imagine going through the paperwork and problems it took to prove disability, and then rethink that I want to get a job again."
- All participants mentioned speaking with a VSO or service counselor for more information and clarification.
- No participant scrolled down to VR&E services on a track without prompting. Two referenced the length of pages as being a hindrance to comprehension.
- One participant tried to click on the number on the "how do I apply?" process subway map instead of on a link or button.
- "The site is very clear and readable - no reds or yellows!"
- "I like Vets.gov. I like the title, and it will be nice once all of this is 100% in one place."
