{Elissa’s introduction}

Bkgd: 61yo ret air force, retired 17-18 y/a. Worked as supply officer. Married 38 y . Has 4 children, adults. After retiring, retired on disability (due to MS); went into IT proj mgmt and spent 15 y doing that in DC, mostly fed gov contracts. Left work in may 2012 and moved to Jax, FL where they have been for the past 5 y.

IT Proj Mgmt is a cool way of thinking. Sensible. Shocking we don’t all think that way. We don’t naturally think the way a project mgr would. Define problem, find alt solutions, figure out cost/benefits of solutions, implement chosen solution, close out implementation and you’re done. But you can use it for anything, s/a getting married. Target date, get people together, consider alternatives (home, hotel, somewhere else). You’re doing c/b analysis all the way thru but ppl are often not organized about it, so there’s a lot of illogical decision making. Interesting in politics - many pol decisions are illogical. I think everyone should learn this worldview.

Familiar with VR&E ?
I am a little bit. Now VR doesn’t apply to me bc, as of of May 12–they decided later, but backdated–I’m on SS disability as of that date. I’m also 100% VA disabled, decided later. VR is meant to get people back into workforce, which is why I don’t think it applies to me.

VETS.gov use before?
It doesn’t sound familiar. I’ve used VA.gov, but not vets. gov.

When questions about benefits, where do you go?
I go to VA.gov. But I haven’t in quite a while b/c I am pretty … it’s amazing how generous the govt is for ppl in my situation. I feel a bit like — did you see movie Office Space, the guy who backed his car out of the garage and was t-boned, and he couldn’t move, but he got all these benefits. Well I feel like him. I got all these benefits, but didn’t have to pay the price. I am like him - I have health problems. But mostly feel like I aged so I’m in my  70s, but i’m 61. I feel like I'm aging fast. Just had a doc’s appt yesterday in fact.

I’m showing Vets. gov. Who is site for?
I would guess this particular page, this is for what people at vets.gov is going to do for people affected by Hurricane Harvey, based on title. It could be broader than that, based on all the different people it shows, but I”m guessing just Hurricane Harvey.

What do you think ppl can do?
Oh you can do a lot here! You don’t have to scroll very far down. You can find about health benefits, 911 conversation, a square to click on for someone in crisis. The lines underneath talk about the different help you can get - disability, education, housing. This opening page gives you a chance to break off into lots of other things.

Where would you look for VR&E?
Let’s see —— ummm. (pause). I might go to explore benefits. Probably would.

Why?
I would expect a list - a dropdown list of some sort.

Seeing the list, where next?
Education & Training.

Where from here?
OH gosh, I got onto educational stuff. Ummm I guess i can always check eligibility.

What words are you looking for?
For me, VR is a career training. So, I would look for something that says job training, career training. “Oh careers and employment", I didn’t see that. But I would guess that would be VA jobs.

Is that what you think you would have found under careers & employment?
(reads options) I don’t know where I’d find it. I would have though under education and training, bc VR is a training thing. Disability? Maybe that? Oh no, it’s not that. That’s referring to benefits.

Read first paragraph. Who is eligible?
Service members with SC disabilities.

Were you familiar w chapter 31?
I may have heard it in the past. but it doesn’t say anything to me today.

Anything unclear?
No. I know that if i’m - if I think I might want VR, this has defined it for me, and now I know what to determine to find if I’m eligible. I’d go to eligibility.

Eligibility  - blue box, what kind of service members are eligible?
Well you need a 20% disability or greater. Oh, ok you could be a vet or active duty awaiting discharge. As active duty you wouldn’t know what your rating is going to be. Do they tell people ahead of time? I didn’t know. I knew what other people were told when they were retired early. If i’m not mistaken, I was put out on a 30% in 99. I think that’s what everybody got out of the AF. Not familiar with the IDES.

What about vets?
10% disability or higher. Actually I didn’t pick up on that. that this is for veterans too. Those are separate. I see now that there are both service members and veterans. So you would have to have a rating by the VA if you’re a vet. And you’ve got problems with employment. I don’t know what a SEH is. I’m sure that is something that the VA figures out.

How would you figure out SEH?
Yeah, i’d go to google. But i’m sure there’s a search area on this site.

Questions about eligibility after reading box?
So on the previous page, it had "ready to apply". So on this page it would take you to benefits to apply. SO you would apply you would find out if you are eligible.

I think it is clear 10% would be eligible, but you might be able to if you could have SEH. Oh but you have SEH and 10%. Well what it didn’t say is if people like me would be eligible. So I’m 100%. So I have too much of a problem and wouldn’t be VR eligible.

I think anyone 100% is not going to go there. b/c we are not going to go here to get a job. B/c i can’t imagine going through the paperwork and problems it took to prove disability, and then rethink that i want to get a job again. I get emails all the time. Obviously, my resume is out there. I get stuff all the time. Mostly they are emails to lots of people But occasionally i get one to me from my resume that is out there on the web. And some of the stuff looks really interesting. But there’s several problems with it. For me to go get a job, then I have to give up SS disability. Worse than that, I could do the job for a few days or a week, but I can’t walk more than a couple hundred feet w/o being exhausted, sitting down, so its not that— yeah, i’m not going to be going for VR b/c i don’t want to waste anyones time. Even though I do want to be 20 y younger, but I can’t do that Elissa.

Tracks - readout - what makes the programs different from one another?
Rapid Access 2 Employment - The first one is to get some training in your current skills.
LT Srvc - learn something new and get work in a different skilled job.
Self Employ - start your own company.
Ind living - isn’t really necessarily a vocational part of this, it’s more of being able to take care of yourself. TO be your own caregiver.
Reemploy- I guess, more of a legal thing. Going back to the same job you had before, so you might need legal help or a ramp at the office.
Why legal: It talks about a right to return. Usually when you’re talking about rights, you’re talking about ensuring that everyone recognizes those, so you need to point to a law, or you need an atty to point that law out.

How do you get on tracks?
I don’t think you need to apply to any one of these at this point. You might already know as the vet in this particular situation what you think you need. “e.g. i really want to buy a carpet cleaning franchise, so that’s the self-employment track.” or “ what i really need is to cook and clean up after myself, and I am not really that good at that.” You might already have your ideas, but I don’t see the point of narrowing it down to one of those 5.

Independent Living track  - why follow?
This is somebody who either doesn’t have a caregiver or wants to be more helpful in their care. This is someone who is trying to be a bit more independent, and little more of a giver, less of a receiver.

Who can get these VRE services?
Oh anyone who applies. well , not applies. Is eligible for this program. I think it was a 10% disability. I think.

Where would you look to find that out?
Ok, yeah. Sure Elissa. Yes there is. Right in the middle in the blue. Well if you have a 20% SC disability and your injuries prevent you from returning to work, and your case manager refers you to this. I don’t know who case manager is, but I guess it’s your doctor. I don’t know.

What is the order in which those happen?
Ummm… well it appears to me that you apply for VRE, then you choose the services you want after you apply. Maybe when you are accepted to VRE you’re still not eligible for all 5 services. Maybe at the application for the VRE, it could tell you which of the 5 you’re eligible for.

When would you expect to find out?
I would expect to find out after I apply. when i look at this it tells me that I”m probably eligible for this. I should apply for VRE, and they’ll tell me if I’m eligible for this, or for the independent business one, or if I have the right to go back to my old job. I don’t know if the application to VRE is also an application to any of the 5.

Is this what you’d expected?
Yes, this is what I would have expected. I mean i might have expected a bit more. This is a track where you’re looking to take more oare of yourself, or you’d be looking to take care of yourself virtually 100% of the time. This depends on your particular situation with caregivers and what your disability might be.

Roadmap - how do I get these benefits? Expectations of process?
What this is doing is telling you where to go to apply for the benefits. You login to E-benefits. Now I don’t even know what an ebenefits account is. I may have one. It might be good for someone like me to have a bit more about what that is. Maybe the url. Then click on VRE. Then apply. The rest of that makes sense, but that first part, could take a bit more information about what that account is. So that’s right, so you don’t even know if you’re eligible until someone takes a look at you. And they’ll get back to you.

If you want to learn about another track, how would you? 
I would hit back, and then I’d click on any one of the others.

If you wanted to find out if a family member is eligible - where to look?
Uhhh— I think the same thing. I mean i don’t think. I don’t know why a family member would be any different from me. I might not be able to apply, but I think it would require their SSN.

Did you know that family members of service members are eligible?
Well, no I thought you were talking about a family member who was also a disabled vet, not just family members of service members? Well I guess I’d go to the family member section there.

Family member page - who is eligible?
Ok, so eligible people are if you are a child or a spouse of a vet who died, or who is perm or totally disabled as a result of service, someone who is alive but has perm and total disability, or who died, (reads it aloud a few times). The  first two lines look the same so I’d have to go through and think about them. Are they about the same? I’m thinking if you’re eligible for the first line, you’re also for the second. There isn’t much of a difference. You could reduce it by one line. IF you can cut 15 words, that is probably good. Yeah i think it’s not a bad idea to look at the and see if you can combine. I don’t know - something to look at !!

There are some others - if you have a MIA. If you’re a spouse or child of MIA. Let’s see, ummm. Service member hospitalized … (reads verbatim). What does that mean? I don’t know. The first part is easy. But the person who is likely to be discharged for that disability? But maybe it’s someone who is not permanently in a care facility.

And the next one is MIA, and the next one is POW. I’m sure most of this is taken from whatever law - Chapter 31 - but you might be able to simplify this a little. You could go back to the law and simplify a bit. Now, anyone who is a spouse or a child of someone who is perm/totally disabled. Person who is hospitalized and … you don’t even have to put that in I think. You do have to put the MIA in. You do need to put the POW in. The last two belong there but could make fewer words. Yeah, I think with a bit of work, this could be simplified. You know if you are the spouse or a child of someone with perm or total disability you’re eligible. And if spouse/child of MIA/POW you’re eligible.

How is this different from the one on educational and vocational counseling services?
Oh this is quite different. This is quite specific. This has nothing to do with the spouse. So you’re a child of a Vietnam or Korean War vet. This is a really weird one. I betcha there’s 4 people with spina bifida. Well i’m just kidding, but this was written specifically for some person. Congress wrote this so someone specific could have some benefit. This probably applies to very few people. But the program does apply to these people who were Korean or Vietnam vet, and has a birth defect, and you have to participate in that Chapter 18 assistance program? What does that mean? I can’t remember what that was called when i was in. But there was a program where we saved some money, and the gov gave us that and a little bit. IF you’re thinking of using your parents GI bill you’re also eligible for your parents VR&E counseling.

How would someone apply?
Well you would go to the bottom, how do i get these benefits, and you do some similar stuff to how we did it earlier, but you may have to click on some different things in there.

Who is applying?
Oh the child, maybe the one in that case who had the spina bifida, and then in the other case there was the spouse of the person.

General Feedback from Jeff:  
Sometimes you get really close to something. By the way everything is very readable. Very clean and readable. No reds or yellows!

[Elissa talked about our efforts to make the site 508 compliant]
It’s fairly important!

One thing - and i don’t have a problem here, but very often when i’m reading something here, but sometimes the text can be a bit too small. But i don’t have a problem with my eyes. But this seems to be no problem. It’s still small, but it is very clear. the font you chose is easy to read. Something to think about, but if you can’ keep the font size up, but i understand that we can’t always fit all that content on one page.

-----------

- initially went to Education to look for VRE, its"career training" so he was looking for "training"; didn't initially see careers lower in the menu so went there second 
- "careers and employment would have to be VA jobs...Voc rehab is a training thing"
- considered and looked at disability but quickly knew that wasn't correct "doesn't fit there"
- eligibility was challenging, believes he would need to start application process to truly determine if he's eligible
- doesn't understand why anyone who has gone through the process of proving a disability at 100% would want to then try and get a job
- most tracks were understandable, but independant living was different than a training thing
- Reemployment is "a legal thing...it uses the words 'right to return'", anything that refers to rights is a legal thing
- independant living is for "somebody who either doesn't have a caregiver, or wants to be more helpful in their care...more of a giver, less of a receiver" - I didn't really hear how he related this back to training for a career???
- for family eligibility, he made the initial assumption that it was for family members who were also disabled veterans "don't know why their eligibility would be any different than mine"

Notes
Thought information banner about Hurricane Harvey was the purpose of the website
The distinction between careers & employment and education & training is unclear

Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Paragraph - who is eligible
Participant did not sound confident in choosing service members
Who's eligible is somewhat clear participant missed some types of individuals that would be eligible
Some terms were not clear to participant - would Google for the right answers
Was unclear how he would meet criteria for eligibility for benefits

Independent Living Track
Felt the purpose of the track was clear

Who Can Apply?
Was unclear about who can apply for benefits
Felt the page needed to be simpler but not sure how
Felt the language was cumbersome
