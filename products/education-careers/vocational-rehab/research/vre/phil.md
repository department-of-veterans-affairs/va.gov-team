-tried using Vet.gov the other day, had a hard time getting on and by the time he got on, he didn’t have much time to navigate
- ‘doesn’t thing about his benefits much’
doesn’t know what he needs as far as other benefits
- 
thinks this site is for: somebody faulty new to coming to the VA to see whats available,
asked was this site related to MHV
disability benefits especially if its service related, he’s trying to get his service related
-has used edu ben. in the past for seminary school
-has been curious about burials and memorials- to see if he would qualify

to find voc. rehab ben.-‘i suppose careers and employment and education ben'.
Careers and employ. -thinking about being in the position of needing a skill coming out of the service.

VR&E page- the key thing is ‘service connected’, if you’re not he knows there are services avail.
-family members portion- for the family members and service men. with service connected dis, click on family mem.
-who is eligible- service related, like i say I am in the process of trying to get that service connected, started having deterioration in his knee a little after getting out of the service, received a stipend from the VA, a monthly check, he believes he gets it based on his low income
both veteran and dependents 
- after being rated serv. conn.- he would start with eligibility and then the application process, he would expect his PVA rep to help with that
-doesn’t contact his PVA no more than twice a year
-eligibility (big blue box)- 
services for VR&E, ‘know it was a lot of services but 
-will help with your self employment
- independent living track- this is what he thought this page would intel
-anyone with a reasonable dis., service connected 20% or higher, which he doesn’t know what that means b/c many of his friends are quite disabled, w/injuries from T11 or higher 
-kinds of ben. I can get- this page is what he would expect to see, instead of following those steps, he could just click one voc. rehab or a place to apply, instead of having to log into eBen. Or if there were a link that would take him there ( would want to go directly to a link to get to an application)
- he would have to apply directly to this program
-asks to scroll around himself to look, ‘anything that simplifies it’
like if I would click on the 4 (under the steps to apply) would simplify it’

Marines. 76. Lost both legs. Needs breathing assistance and has brain damage due to lack of oxygen when coded a few years ago. Legally blind.
Catastrophically handicap level 4.
Lives in Grand Rapids.
Does some carving. Sold a piece last year for $1700.
Navigation: Where do you expect to find VR&E?
-    Education
-    Or Careers & Employment (in terms of benefits to reskill to get a new job)

VR&E Benefits: Does landing page copy make sense?
Yes, first paragraph makes sense. Not sure about the family members being eligible.

VR&E Eligibility: Who is eligible for these benefits?
Applies to service-connected disability (note: seems to stay on this general point rather than specifics of eligibility).

How to Apply: How would you start?
Would start with Eligibility and maybe Application Process, which I would expect my PVA rep to help me with. Works with her maybe twice a year.

Program Tracks: Understandable?
Seems to get the basics of what differentiates the different tracks.
Notes that he has short-term memory issues, so having to click through many pages is hard.
