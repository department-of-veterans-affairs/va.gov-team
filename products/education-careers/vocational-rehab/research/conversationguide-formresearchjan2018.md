# Conversation Guide: VR&E

## Goals

1. Are Veterans and current servicemembers able to determine the VR&E benefits for which they are eligible? Are they able to determine what to do to receive those benefits?
2. Does the flow of the form make sense?
3. Do all the form labels make sense, and the Veterans aren't confused by what we're asking from them?
4. Do they know what to expect after they apply?
5. (Potentially work in the error messaging Mel's working on)Do the different messaging make sense?

## We will know we have been successful if:

1. We have a clearer understanding of whether Veterans find the eligibility wizard tool usable for helping them determine whether they might be eligible or not
2. We have a sense as to which areas of the form are clear or confusing to participants

## Who are our participants?

We are looking for Veterans who 
1. Have at least 10% service-connected disability
2. Have received a discharge that is other than dishonorable

3 participants have applied for VR&E before
3 participants who haven't applied for VR&E

## Key research questions

1. Is the eligibility wizard helpful? Does it help inform the Veterans whether they're eligible better than the blue box content?
2. Do the Veterans know what to do at each step of the form?

## Methods

- Remote usability testing of the VR&E prototypes. Guided tasks, some interview-style questions.

## Conversation guide - Veterans and Current Servicemembers

### Introduction

Thank you for joining us today. My name is Elissa, and I'm joined on the line by some colleagues who are observing the session and helping me take notes. We are doing this feedback session on behalf of the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs to learn how to make one section of our website more useful to you.  

Before we begin, I’d like to make a few things clear and explain how the session will work.

**We aren’t testing your ability.** In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we want to hear whether this section of the site makes sense to you. I'm hoping this can be an honest conversation between you and me, and I promise I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.

**Please think aloud.** While you are going through the site, please try as much as possible to vocalize your reactions, thoughts, and decisions as you see each page. That helps us to better share your thoughts with other members of our team. 

**This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be respectful of your time, so I may move us along a little faster at various points.

**If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**  You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop, and you will still receive your $25 thank you. 

Do you have any questions at this stage?

Are you comfortable if I record this session? I'd like to record our conversation and what you do on the screen  so we can make sure to capture your thoughts accurately. 

Great! I'm going to turn on screen and audio recording now.

[The moderator will begin audio and screen recording.]

### Warm-up questions

Before we dig in on the site, I'd like to ask you a few questions so we get used to talking togther.

- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work)
- What's your favorite thing about living in [place]?
- Have you used the VA for services before? If yes, which? If not, why not?
- How do you access benefits? Do you use any online services to manage them? What was that experience like?
- Are you familiar with Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment services through the VA? Are you using those benefits? Do you plan to use those benefits in the future?

### Getting situated on Vets.gov

- Have you ever used Vets.gov before?
- When you have questions about your VA benefits, where do you go to find information?

Now I'm going to share my screen with you. You should see the Vets.gov homepage.

### Finding out your eligibility 

Prototype: https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/KXF2UUB3H

Feel free to take a minute to look around the eligibility page

_Prototype page 1_
- Read through the content in this page. How would you go about finding out whether or not you are eligible for VR&E benefits?
- Who is eligible for VR&E benefits?
- What do you think would happen if you selected your service criteria and hit next?

Continue to allow the participant to go through the eligibility wizard.
- Why do you think you're being asked these questions?
- How many more steps do you think there are before you find out whether or not you are eligible for VR&E benefits?
- What do you think would happen if you clicked "no" on discharge in past 12 years?

_Last step - eligibility decision_
- Is this what you thought you would see here?
- What else do you want to know about your eligibility now?
- Does this information help you determine whether you are eligible for VR&E benefits?
- Do you have more information now than at the beginning of this process about whether or not you are eligible for VR&E benefits? If yes, what information?
- What would you do next?
- What do you think you would see here if you weren't eligible?
- What would you do if you disagreed with this information?
- Do you feel that you have enough information to apply? If not, what else do you want to know? Where would you go to find that information?
- Where would you go to begin the application process, if you were ready to apply?
- What would you expect to happen if you clicked on [either call to action]? Did you notice the other link? If you clicked that link, what would you expect to happen?

Ok, now we're going to look at the application for VR&E itself. Even though you're on a computer right now, I'm going to show you what the application would look like if you were applying using a mobile phone. Do you currently use a smartphone?
