### Warm-up questions

- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? 
  - "I'm a 8-year Army Veteran, currently a full-time student now in Tampa, FL area. I've used the VA.gov website in the past…to help me get access to educational benefits, mostly what I've used that before. I did have some difficulties getting some questions answered…going through there. That's why this study was interesting, being able to help other Veterans get easier access..."
- Have you used the VA for services before? If yes, which? If not, why not?
  - Is using Post-9/11 GIB
  - "I used the VA health…family physician type services."
- How do you access your benefits? Do you use any online services to manage them? What was that experience like?
  - Manages prescriptions, medication benefits through "the website", accessing health records through there "is useful as well."
- Are you familiar with Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment services through the VA? Are you using those benefits? Do you plan to use those benefits in the future?
  - "I've heard of them, I know a little bit about them, I haven't personally used them myself."
  - Has heard: "it could be potentially more useful for certain veterans based on their disability ratings, they could get higher level of benefits out of than than say Post-9/11 GIB for example. That's about all I know…I haven't looked into it too much myself."

### Getting situated on Vets.gov

- Have you ever used Vets.gov before?
  - [long silence] "uhhhh…yes." Has used it for "looking for information on medical benefits."
  - "I think that seemed pretty easy to me. I believe I was actually able to apply for healthcare benefits through that website if I'm not mistaken."
- When you have questions about your VA benefits, where do you go to find information?
  - "Typically I prefer to go online to a centralized website like va.gov before I start having to go and visit or call people personally. I feel like a lot of my questions hsould be able to be answered that way, general benefits questions. There was times where I was just…mabye the information on the website was too general, not enough detail there, but I'm not sure how detailed they could get, if a lot of people are going to have individual results. Education enefits for example I feel like could be more detailed in there, especially for like post-9/11 GIB is going to be pretty much the same eligibility for everyone there."
  - "I think it would be nice if there was some kind of tool where you're putting in your personal information and it runs a test and lets you know if you are eligibile for that benefit or not, versus just giving a broad general description….because you know a lot of times people are still unclear. I did also a lot of looking around for actual dollar amounts I would be receiving after I was approved for that benefit, and a lot of times I'd end up on some third-party website where I wasn't sure that information was accurate or current. That'd be another helepul one too, if that was easy to find on the va.gov website, where we could trust the information and know that it was current."

### Finding out your eligibility

Prototype: https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/D3G2XXQYAUG#/screens/281857791_Eligibility

_Prototype page 1_

- What's the purpose of this page?
  - "I think a lot of servicemembers and veterans that have heard about this benefit don't have it properly explained to them…think it's only for finding employment, and not necessarily an educational-based service that can help them get a college degree or vocational training, and so a lot of Veterans wouldn't go looking for this benefit at all. Especially if they're looking to go to college or something like that."
  - "I know they do mention education and vocational training here on this page [scrolling] but for me it just seems like it needs to be more descriptive of receiving educational benefits. I guess maybe if we went through this process of applying for the voc rehab benefit, I don't know what kind of [inaudible] would be doing there."
- What kind of info about VR&E would you be looking for here?
  - lots of uh, ums as he scrolls around
  - "I guess like if they had some more description about what kind of schools you could use it at, maybe?"
  - "I see here you do have a line about post-secondary training out of college..."
- Read through the content in this page. How would you go about finding out whether or not you are eligible for voc rehab benefits?
  - "I'm reading here on the page the basic period of eligibility, so that seems pretty basic there — includes quite a few veterans in that eligibility there, but like I said it always helps to be able to go through an additional step where it's confiring you as an individual are eligible to receive that benefit." 
  - [when prompted to see if something like ^ exists] "I believe I saw something…scroll a little further up [we have lag]"
  - "I guess it's right there in that box here [grey box]"…is prompted to interact with the box, explained that it's a prototype
  - "This is another area, too, that for me was always kind of a grey area because even now just coming to this first step in this application process, a lot of Veterans that I'm familiar with don't have a disability rating right now. For example if you're discharged as a nat'l guard…member they don't put you through the same process as they do when you'er discharging as an active duty. I'm going to have to go make an appointment at the nearest VAMC and get [a disability rating] before I can apply for this benefit, so I think a lot of people at this point stop the process. Not saying it shouldn't be a requirement, because that's part of the benefit…but that might be a separate issue to discuss."
  - The question says "did you separate OR receive a disability…I don't know if that's assuming if you separated you did receive a rating, or if that's saying that's not necessarily a requirement. If I get further in this process now, and find out that I don't havae a disability rating but right now i'm going through like I'm qualified, that woudl be confusing to me. I'm going to click yes — I did separate — but I did not receive a disability rating, I don't know how that will affect the process…as far as I know, if I don't have that rating I'm actually not eligible."
  - "That little drop-down box, the…way it seems right now its just assuming [if you've separated you have a disability rating]…not everyone is put through that process….when you're a reservist or nat'l guard they don't put you through that process. They tell you thanks for your time and send you on your way."
  - P doesn't currently have a disability rating; he's a reservist.
- What's the difference between chapter 36 and chapter 31 benefits? Who is eligible for each?
  - "Between ch 31 and 36?…._scrolling_…."
  - "Chapter 36 sounds like access to an academic advisor or a career advisor, kind of help you get an idea of what you are capable or eligible to do after you leave military service, which I can see being very useful for Veterans once they leave the service. They don't know where to start doing that."
  - "Chapter 31 Vocational Rehabilitation…that sounds more like it's specifically just for finding a job, you know immediately just going into a new career, new job, versus also being able to receive potentially long-term training for a new career. I feel like maybe if there was some more explanation on that, maybe on the home page, letting people know [they're] eligible for career training, diversity education…not just 'we're going to help you find another job.''
- Without a disability rating, are you eligible for Ch36?
  - "I would think so, for the counseling benefits at least, that you'd be eligible for those with or without the disability rating, but not necessarily for the following vocational training that we're talking about."
- Reaction to seeing "we're sorry"?
  - "I'd be a little bit disappointed tbh…and I would have some questions, like who's eligible and why am I not eligible. I think there should be maybe a way for you to click here in this box to contact someone or have someone contact you to explain why you weren't eligible….some way that you could be eligible. Maybe someone just hadn't gone and received that disability rating yet but they actually would be eligible for one if they knew where to go. So I think there should be something here…for someone to follow up on."
  - What do you think "vocational counseling" means?

### Chapter 36

- Do you feel like you have enough information to know whether or not you might be eligible for chapter 36 benefits? What would you do to begin the process of applying?
  - [long silence] "You know, I'm going to go ahead and click on that button after reading this blue box"
- What do you expect would happen if you clicked on the green button labeled "apply for vocational counseling"?
  - "I would expect some kind of application to come up next, with drop down boxes like you saw before."

*flip over to chapter 36 form*: https://staging.vets.gov/employment/vocational-rehab-and-employment/application/chapter36

#### Intro page

* Is this what you expected to see?
  * "not exactly, I wasn't expecting to see another little box with another buttn to go to another page."
  * "It's a little annoying; I would have expected to go right to the application here. But I'm reading now…I guess what we were reading before was just…general probably accessible page that anyone could just go and be reading that information. Wouldnt' need to be signed in at that point. So it makes sense to me that it's set that way. Another way to do it could have been when we clicked and went to this page, to start filling out your information to send it to be evaluated, at that point potentially filling out VA [form number] but I don't know what this next step looks like."

- What benefit are you about to apply for?

- Would you be likely to create an account before you start?

  - "Perosnally I would think it'd be a good idea especially if I'm expecting to use and/or apply for additional Veteran benefits in the future. If I knew that I could do them all from the same site and making an account would be beneficial to me, I wouldn't mind having to create an account before I started my first application for benefits through this website..."

- Do you have enough information to begin the application? If not, what else do you need?

- What kinds of questions do you think you'll be asked on the application?

  *Go ahead and click on the button to begin your application.*

#### Chapter 36 form

*Page 1*

*  How would you answer this question ('are you a servicemember or a veteran')?
  * "I would answer 'yes'"

*Page 2* - go ahead and enter your information or made-up information here.

*Page 3*

- How would you answer this question?
  - "I'd be leaving all this blank, personally. I kind of wonder what 'other' means."
  - "The way the first question up here goes…makes it sound like if I had it could speed up my application process or maybe disqualify me, and the other box…probably would tend to leave that blank. I don't even know what they're wanting to see there. It wouldn't be one of those following benefits, so it doesn't even make sense." Enters "what do you want here" in the box.

*Page 4*

* For branch of service is wondering why we don't have a drop-down; there's only five branches of service and it would be easy. "Plus also you might be getting a variety of typedin answers here. [ratty data] and how is their system going to process that?"

- If you had served multiple times, how would you enter another period of service?
  - "That's good that you have the option for another service period…I would expect an exact replica [of what's already on the screen]"
- What other info will you be asked for after clicking continue?
  - "Hmm…honestly, I don't know, I can't think of something specific I'd be expecting to fill out next."

*Page 5* & *Page 6* (bonus page 5)

- Why do you think you're being asked for this information?
- What kind of e-mail would you expect to get from VA?
  - "It would be nice…in this application process to get a confirmation e-mail after we finish here, let you know they received the application. Other than that…I wouldn't expect to get too much e-mail from there unless it was confirmation of something I've applied for or medical appointments I've set up, educational benefits I've applied for, whatever. Typically, I haven't been receiving too many emails from them other than confirmations…something I appreciate. Get too much spam…these days.
  - Wouldn't mind receiving an email about benefits he might be eligible — like vr&e that most veterans aren't ware they're eligible for.


*Page 7 (review app)*

- How would you review what you've entered?
  - "click the plus signs"
- What if you wanted to edit a section of the form? What do you think would happen?
  - "I see a nice clearly marked 'edit' box and it takes me right to the information right there. I like that. A lot of systems would take you all the way back ot the original page…and you'd have to get all the way to the end again."
  - Jokes about having to read the entire privacy policy
- What do you think will happen after you submit your application?

[hold for end cap?]

_Confirmation page_

- What is the purpose of this page?
  - "You've got a confirmation the application has been sent and received by the website…letting you know that if they have questions they can contact me. If I'm eligible, I will receive an invitation to meet with someone to discuss my options. They recommend printing this whole page for my records, which I would probably do. It would still also be nice to receive a confirmation e-mail as well; a lot of people don't necessarily have access to a printing device."
- What would you do with this information? / confirmation number
  - "What would I do with it? I would just leave it on this page, printed out, or in the e-mail I would like to receive it'd be in there too and I would be saving that email. Hopefully I'd never have to use this number…it would mean I've had a problem..."
  - Would wait seven business days before calling if he hadn't heard anything
