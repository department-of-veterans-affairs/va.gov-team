# Voc Rehab Usability Testing, Round 2

## Findings

- Distinction between chapter 36 and 31 is still unclear.
  - P1: "I was always told that VR is ch31 is, I was never told what Ch36 is…when I got out it was all VR put together."
  - P2: "You're talking about chapter 36, which is part of the GI Bill. Chapter 31 is the Voc Rehab I'm applying for soon."
  - P2: "36 is for people still in the military, active duty. 36 is vocational counseling, and educational counseling. 31 is voc rehab for disabled veterans, people who have a service connected disability that prevents them from working.
  - P3: "Umm, chapter 31 - what is chapter 31? I didn't know there were two different ones. I see that 31 VR&E applies for those who have a 10% disability, where chapter 36 is for all Veterans, as long as it's been less than a year since separation."
  - P4: ""Chapter 36 sounds like access to an academic advisor or a career advisor, kind of help you get an idea of what you are capable or eligible to do after you leave military service, which I can see being very useful for Veterans once they leave the service. They don't know where to start doing that." Thinks about Voc Rehab as being an education benefit, "not just 'we're going to help you find another job.'"
- This is indicative of larger uncertainty around what education benefits are available to Veterans.
  - P1: "Let them know what their benefits are — if they can get GI Bill first, use GI Bill, if that can help them get the most out of it. "One of my coaches has just gotten out of the Army…and he believes he should get student loans for the first few years [of PT school] and then use GI Bill." He doesn't currently qualify for VR, but he didn't know that, but nobody tells you that during your out-processing. "having something like that would help them be able to…maximize their beneifts, or know about the process. Because I didn't know that."
  - P4: ""I think a lot of servicemembers and veterans that have heard about this benefit don't have it properly explained to them…think it's only for finding employment, and not necessarily an educational-based service that can help them get a college degree or vocational training, and so a lot of Veterans wouldn't go looking for this benefit at all. Especially if they're looking to go to college or something like that."
- Participants have become used to having to sign in to websites before being able to fill out forms. 
  - P2: "I'm assuming I would have to sign in before I got here. How would it know who I am?"
  - P4: "It's a little annoying; I would have expected to go right to the application here."
- Past trust issues with the VA affect Veterans' comfort with sharing information about themselves on applications.
  - P1 had a harrowing experience with four different Voc Rehab counselors. "My only concern about this part, where it says if it's' working…if that would, if they're working, are they going to use that against them? To me that means, if they're working and they're going to school for something, will [they use that against them.]"
- Nice work on usability features!
  - P2 on chapter 36 eligibility: "This one doesn’t take you through the screening process like on the last one. That was very helpful. This one you would need to know which is 36 and 31."
  - P3 on save in progress: "Websites are a lot easier that way."
  - P3 on reviewing form fields: "Oh, well that's convenient. A lot of pages, for example, when I just filed my taxes, if I wanted to go back to a previous section, I had to click through to go through all the other pages to get back ot the end. I thought that would happen here, that I would have to click continue to get thru all the other pages."
  - P4 on reviewing form fields: ""I see a nice clearly marked 'edit' box and it takes me right to the information right there. I like that. A lot of systems would take you all the way back ot the original page…and you'd have to get all the way to the end again."
- Some questions could use clarification
  - Are you working?
    - P1 would want to add more qualitative information: "How long have you been out? Is this a job you want to continue at, are you hoping to get something else out of it kind of thing"
  - Education
    - Confusion around number of years in school (K-12? Just post-secondary?)
  - Disability
    - Usability question
      - P1 suggests a drop-down menu of disabilities
      - P2: "This is for my disability. I’m 90% disabled, spinal stenosis, PTSD. So I would type that in. [user types conditions]. I can’t remember them all. There are so many. Oh migraines too."
      - P3: "What kind of description is it asking for?"
    - Where are records stored?
      - P1: Office where the records are located — "some people may not know where their records are located." She does because there's only one in Virginia.
      - P3: "I don’t know. It's asking for disability records. Is it asking for medical records or disability records for benefits? Like my local benefits office. I was gonna come here and choose health b/c I’m thinking health records." [re: facility locator]
  - Perpetual ch 36 education question difficulties
    - P2: "Veteran's education assistance based on own service? I don’t even know what that means."
    - P4: ""The way the first question up here goes…makes it sound like if I had it could speed up my application process or maybe disqualify me, and the other box…probably would tend to leave that blank. I don't even know what they're wanting to see there. It wouldn't be one of those following benefits, so it doesn't even make sense." [Enters "what do you want here" in the box.]
- Side note on 12 months/1 year/12 years
- Side note on notifications from P3: "It would be a bummer to give my email address but it was never used!"
- Can branches of service be a drop-down menu?
- P2 on Chapter 31 form: "I think it was very smooth and easy to understand. I don’t see where it would be confusing. Very clear, concise, and most importantly succinct."

## Follow-up questions and thoughts

- We managed to talk to three Veterans who are all in the same age range, three who served in the Air Force, and four who are on the east coast. I would want to speak with at least one more person who does not fit that pattern before fully sharing conclusions.
- Do Chapter 36 and Chapter 31 eligibility have to live on the same static content page?
- Convert "branch of service" answers to a drop-down menu to limit variations of answers.
- Discuss necessity and wording of Chapter 36 education checkboxes with stakeholder - these have caused confusion across two rounds of usability testing.
- Review Chapter 31 education section: determine more effective wording of "years of education" and whether that answer should be a drop-down number.
- Consider adding tooltips on Chapter 31 pages about employment and education to clarify why this information is needed and reassure Veterans that the information won't be held against them.
- Discuss viability of changing disability descriptions to a drop-down menu of conditions.
- Discuss viability of integrating facility locator into "where are your records stored?" answers.
- "The power of the pen could potentially make someone homeless or not. And they don't understand that. There's a lot of stress being a veteran in this country. And being a disabled one is a lot more stress…this shouldn't be another stressor." - P1
