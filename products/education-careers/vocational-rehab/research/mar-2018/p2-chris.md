# VR&E Research Session – Friday 3/9/18, 1pm P2

## M: Moderator Introduction 

M: Before we dig in on the site, I’m going to ask a fewquestions to get used to talking. 

 

C: My name is Chris. I’m 33yo. I’m a veteran. I was inAF> I joined 3/195 and got out 09. I made rank staff sergeant. 3 combattours in Iraq. I did a tour in camp buca, and sustained an injury there to myback. My 2nd was in Kuwait and I was responsible for doing … that was one of mytoughest deployments, I had to working in the morgue… and my last deploymentwas 2009 – it was the largest air base in Iraq. Any time base was attacked, wewent over an iED once. I got out in 2009. I was just trying to see where Icould get a job – at a club, as a bouncer. I tried going back to school. Wasdiagnosed w PTSD in 2010, my ab. To concentrate was diminished. I was alwayswatching door, counting ppl, seeing if they had something heavy or out ofordinary. 

 

I ended up in fed prison. I got involved w family member ondrug deal. I’ve been out for a year. Looking back, it was a blessing, it forcedlifestyle change. I have been able to finish my AA degree. I’m almost done withBA in biz mgmt. And going for MA. 

 

I just needed to continue moving fwd. I made poor decisions,suffered consequences, need to move forward. 

 

M: You shared VA services imp

 

P2 – I used the GI bill. It has been a blessing. With ptsd,I have extra time, I have to get letter from doc to show to school to show cogissues re concentrating, needing extra time to take exams. That has been hugehelp. I am a member of __ at my school, they provide me w free tutoring if inneed it, writing lab. The other thing is that with those issues, I cannot imaginegoing to school getting a job, I treat school like my job. It’s my income. Thathas been a tremendous help for me. As far as those have been the only benefitsI have used now. I have 7-8 months on gi bill. I do want to transfer over toVR&E to get my MA. I’ll be transferring over to that soon. 

 

M: we’ll be talking about VR^E today. DO you use services. 

 

P2: I use EBN at home. I now use vets. Gov

I use it to monitor benefits. I have an active… one stopshop to do things with my benefits. I Haven’t used it too much, but now that Iknow about that resource that will be my go to site. 

 

M: You should see screen. Blank tab. Start out w page forVets.gov. I’m going to invite you to look around, scroll, read through, andwhat is purpose of page/ 

 

P2: Should I read out loud??

After the first line or first few words, and --- you aretalking about Chapter 36, which is the part of the gi bill. Ok so now, I’mgoing through the chapter 31. That is the VR which is what I’m applying forsoon. Speaking aloud, it’s telling you how you’re eligible for benefits

 

M: diff btw 36 and 31

 

P2: Can I get 36 – career counseling, … user reads the bluebox “Can I get Chapter 36 educational…” 

M: Rnsp btw 36 & 31

P2: 36 is for ppl still in military, active duty. [I’mhaving problems scrolling]. Right there. Down a little more. Perfect. SO I’mguessing 36 is voc counseling. And educational counseling. And if you qualifyfor it, you click that blue box. Then 31 is voc rehab for disabled veterans. Okchap 31 is for ppl who have srvc conn disability which prevents them fromworking. 

 

M: how would you find out if you’re e eligible

 

P2: I would put the veteran in that box. 

Oh you want me to try it out? 

M: sure

P2: clicks veteran, puts disability rating, 

M: Click next. What would you put for this question? 

P2 – I had honorable discharge, so I would just say hon.

M: do you know why I’m being asked

P2- I don’t know. I’m guess it’s prob reqt for 31. You gotout in 12 years, and I was out in 09 so it’s w/I 12 y.

 M; is this what youthought you’d see

P2- yup. Actually, I have to do this soon. It’s good I’mgetting this practice. My gi bill is running out soon. Is it live yet? 

M: this is a prototype, but will let you know when live. Doyou have enough info to click to apply?

P2: It’ll ask me to login – using that login I use for ebnor vdts.gov, and then would send the information to my location in brow cty,and then they would send an appointment via letter so I could get counseling. 

M: let’s click on button. Is this what you thought? 

P2: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you sign in and fill out one of theforms. 

M: would you sign in? 

P2: would I? Right now it didn’t ask me to, but I amassuming I would have to sign in before I got here. How would it know who I am?

M: what would you do.

P2: yeah it’s telling you there, if you login it’ll prefillinformation based on a/c details. Should I go ahead? Should I fill it out? 

M: You can put as much or as little of real info as you want

P2: I’m getting stuck

M: having some scroll issues here 

P2: haha ok. --- 

Are we going to do another one of those ones where I have tosort? It was actually pretty hard. 

I’m having problems filling things in. 

 

M: do you know why you’re being asked

P2 – I think it’s trying to weed out to make sure I’meligible

M: more periods, how would you add

P2 – right there, add another service period

M: why asking you that

P2 ---- Depending on which conflict I served in, there maybe diff benefit. SO I did OIE OIF. 

M: how answer? 

P2: I would click boxes. Cont. 

M: why asked this ? 

P2: I dunno. Prob another elig. Reqt. So it’s seeing if youare working. Trying to figure out what kind of job working in. since its vocrehab, it might be trying to place you in something in your current career. 

M: How would you ans 4/8 question

P2 – right now jr in college, so I would say 12 yrs ofschool, 13 w K, plus 3 more, 16 years. 

List any VA or Non VA voc rehab pgms in. 

M: how answer? 

P2 – I know there is a pgm I app for it but didn’t go intoit. I can’t remember the name. you pretty much go they give you a job and payyou. I think it’s work counseling or something like that. You need to go to w/etreatment you need while you’re there at the VA hospital. It’s called CWG

M: how would you answer questions. 

I went thru initial stages. Met w counselor, she helped me wresume. I couldn’t do it b/c I was going to school so much. 

 

I would put cwd b/c I did start it. 

M: How would you answer these questions? 

P2: this is asking me for dis rating. It won’t let me click.

This is for my dis, I’m 90% disable, spinal sten. Ptsd. So Iwould type that in. [user types conditions]. I can’t remember them all. Thereare so many. Oh migraines too. 

M: Why asking current in hospital

P2: if you are curr in hosp, they would send s1 to see you,or they could make other arr to see how disabled you are. 

6/8 Contact info: 

P2: should I put my address? 

M: perfect. 

P2: can you scroll down? 

M: why do you think they ask if you move

P2: if you are moving, you might know your next address, andyou can put that in, so they can update.

M: how many more ?

P2: 2 more b/c I’m on 6/8. It’s asking for my phone #.

 

M: Do you have digital copies
p2: yeah I do. Do you actually want me to upload it. 

M: What would you do? 

P2: I would upload discharge doc. I would click that. Thatdidn’t do anything. 

M: I’m going to upload a random doc from my computer.

P2: OK. So, would this be a pop up? It’s asking proof ofDD214, to show proof of military which is most import form. So, you guys canhave it on file there. SO, I would continue after I upload it. 

M: Review – I
p2 – this is a review of everything I put up. If I need to review anything, I
would click plus sign and would review what I put up there. 

M: what would you do 

P2 – I would hit that bad boy right there. It takes me backto the screen where I can change that info, I can make changes, hit update, andit takes me right back. 

 

I accept policy and then hit submit. 

And it submits app

M; what does this page tell you? 

P2: It’s giving me a conf # & date rec form, and myname, and form I fills out, and the phone # to call w questions, and hours Ican call, and what’s gonna happen now, and that you received it

 

I would take a screen shot and save it. If I didn’t hearanything, I would call that number. 

 

M: how long to wait

 

P2 – a week. In my last voc rehab, they were pretty goodabout getting back w/I 1.5-2 wks. 

 

M: any other ?s

 

P2: I think it was v smooth or easy to understand. I don’tsee where it would be confusing. Very clear, concise, and most imp. Succinct. 

 

M: one more activity. Then wrap up. You noticed there were 2things you could apply for it. We’re running Ch. 36 at the same time. And we’llgo through the same thing we just did. Can you tell us from this page how 36differ from 31? 

 

P2: This is 36 or 31? 

 

M: which do you think? 
P2 I knew you were gonna say that. It’s the 31 I think. Lemme keep reading.
Before it said 36 and 31, now let me see. No it doesn’t says 36 or 31. I would
have to know the 36 or the 31. 

 

M: how different than the one you filled out

 

P2: this one doesn’t take you thru screening process like onthe last one. That was very helpful. This one you would need to know which is36 and 31. 

 

Should I go? 

 

Oh here we go, it does it after. 

 

M: how would you answer 1/5/ 

P2: I think it’s a trick question. They are putting servicemeber or veteran in same question? 

M: What would happen if you click no? 

P2: it would disqualify you. But since I fall under this one[veteran] I would click that. 

M: How would you answer this question 3/6 

P2: I don’t know> I would put this one (31). Veteranseducation assist based on own service I don’t even know what that means. 

M: what do you think

P2 I wanna say it might be tuition reimbursement if you areactive, but it has veteran in the beginning. It might be helpful, if you have adetails link to give you a clearer understanding of ex what that means. I wouldalso hit other b/c I have the gi bill. 

I guess I can put…

[Screen 4/6]

P2: it’s being weird again. Its March 2005 – Oct 2009. 

Honorable. 

If I needed to I could add another srvc period right there. 

[5/6]

P2: oh… Here you go. 

[5/6 part 2]

M: what sort of comm would you expect to rec

P2: I would expect letter. I never get called. Well act fordoc apt, they do call me but auto system, but everything else is letter thrumail. 

[6/6 review]

P2 – same thing review. Click on plus to edit. Hit privacypolicy. Submit. 

 

M: what would you do with this info

{2 – same thing, screenshot, save for records, maybe printit, and if I don’t’ hear in 2 wks I call # at the bottom, give conf #, and sayI sub app for Voc Rehab and hadn’t heard

 

M: what next

P2: I would get a letter. 

 

M: one more ? before we wrap up. You have a sense of vocrehab in most contexts. If you were talking to someone new to process, wouldthis be straightforward to them. 

P2: I thought the first one was a lot more clear in terms ofletting you know you were eligible for this reason. 

 

M: Anything else to share? 

P2: that’s it. 

 

M: Will send over card sorting. Thanks so much. We will giveyou BOTH of those thank you gifts.
