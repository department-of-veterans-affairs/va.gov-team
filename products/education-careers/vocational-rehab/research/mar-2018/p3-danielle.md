VR&E Session – Friday 3/9/18, 2pm P3. 

M: Moderator intro 

M: Tell us about 

P3: Well I’m not sure what you want to know. I retired fromAF last year and live in Williamsburg VA w my 11yo son. I am going thru 2ndphase of VR {voc rehab} pgm working w coordinator. 

Only 18.5 years. I wasn’t able to serve the full 20. 

I just finished school thru voc rehab pgm. Now I’m just outon my job search. 

Ummm anything in the psych field. My degree is in that. I’mlooking in that field and research as well. 

Not clinical. My degree is org psych. I’m looking for HRtype jobs, training, dvpt {development}, stuff like that. 

Probably the people. I love the area. The people are nice.The area is not too crowded. I lived a little further east, and it was gettingtoo crowded. I moved here and am loving it so far. 

M: Have you used other VA services before

P3: Not really. The usual VA home loan, and VA health care,but that’s all. 

M: Do you go online to mg

P3: I’m on EBN quite often. 

M: when you have questions about VA benefits, where do yougo to get info? 

P3: Um, I … to be totally honest, I just google my question.If it’s not something that links directly from my EBN homepage or dashboard, Igoogle my question and spend a lot of time on the va.gov website. 

M: Have you used vets.gov before? 

P3: no. 

VR&E eligibility 

M: Purpose of page? 

P3: Well, um, it looks like the purpose of page is just toexplain the VR&E pgm to veterans, um, it’s actually written quite well. 

M: what makes you say that? 

P3: b/c all the info is on 1 page. These are a lot ofquestions I had when I entered IDEP process. I had to go all over the internetto find answer to my questions all the info is right here. What it is, who iseligible. So yeah. 

M: What is the difference btw 36 and 31

P3: UM, chapter 31  -ch 31 is um, what is ch 31? I didn’t know there were 2 diff ones. 

M: had you heard about 36 before? 

P3- Yes. That’s just the basic VRE right? 

M: Is that what this page is telling you? 

P3: mmmmm, so is the difference the disability? I see that31 VR&E applies for those who have a 10 % disability where ch 36 is for allveterans. Oh as long as it’s been less than a year since separation. 

M: could someone use both ch 36 and ch 31 benefits? 

P3: [pause] I haven’t found the answer to that on this page.I don’t see it on this page. My gut feeling is no. Am I missing it, is it onhere? 

M: I’m not entirely sure. We are trying to fig out wherelingering questions are. We have done various iterations of this page. Howwould s1 find out if they are eligible.

P3: by just looking at this page. I mean—it seems, it laysit out pretty well. I mean chapter 31-- It has the basic eligibility. Hmm. 

M: what’s behind that HMM? 

P3: Um. I looking at this it seems like it should be prettystraightforward to determine what benefits I would be eligible for b/c it hasthe Ch. 31 and the enlisted Ch. 36 as well, so what I would do, b/c it might bemissing it but I don’t see where its straightforward for which one I can usenow, so not more than 1 year ago I was discharged from the military, so I wouldassume I would be eligible for both, so I would click on the apply for voc counselingor voc rehab questions. It would give me eligibility questions and tell me ifI’m eligible

M: What if they were different. 

P3 – I don’t know. Should I click on them? One is forcounseling and other is for rehab.

M: did you notice the grey box that helped you figure outelig. 

P3- No. It’s right in my face, but I totally missed it. I tcould go at the top of the page or in the right. Separate from the diff materialand I totally missed it. I kept scrolling from para to para. 

M: what would you do w that box? 

P3: I would click veteran. 

M: and next? 

P3: It would prob reroute me to a page w additional eligquestions. 

M: is that what you were expecting? 

P3: Yes. 

M: [explains prototypes] 

P3: Ok, so then next. 

M: expected? 

P3: Yeah. Yeah I fig it would go thru elig questions andthen tell me if I’m eligible or not. This is spec 31. Why is it just 31 and not36? 

M: Why do you think? 

P3: What in the world? Um. 

M: Um, I’m just trying to make sense of this? 

P3: It says I’m not elig for 31 which makes sense bc I haveto be in 12 months of discharge. 

M: Moderator takes her back to question about service conndis. 

P3: I went through iDES so got my dis rating prior todischarge. In my case I rec my disability rating 18 months ago. SO maybe thatquestion is a little.. 

M: Last word? 

P3: YEARS. Oh my gosh. 

M: is there a better way we can phrase this? 

P3: for some reason I was stuck on the 12 months, b/c of the36 box above. I went from that box down to this box, and still had a year in myhead. For some reason I thought 12 months. 

M: you’re not the first person who had this issue. [helpsher click yes]

Is this what you exp to see? 

p3: yes

M: do you have enough info to apply now? 

P3: Hmmmm. No. B/c if I wasn’t familiar w program I wouldstill have questions. Where would I go? When would I start? Is there anything Ineed to do beforehand? I would come up to application process. I would expectapp process to take me to a step by step guide of how the app works. 

M; What do you think would happen if you clicked on a greenbutton for voc counsel or voc rehab? 

P3: What would happen if I clicked on a green button? 

M: what woujld you expect ot see next? 

P3: prob a screen asking me personal info, name, that kindof stuff, service, I would expect it to collect more information from me. 

M: Go ahead and click on whichever you want to explorefirst.

[user clicks counseling]

M: is this what you thought you would see. 

P3: well yeah. This is exactly what I was thinking when Iwas talking about the app process. Is that what the app process link is for.Does it link to this? This is what I would expect ot see bc this shows the appprocess. 

Well yeah so, this is the questions I would have, what do Ineed to do before I start, what do I need to gather, the stuff ppl need to knowahead of time before applying. 

M: now od you have enough info to start application? 

P3: Um. No. I don’tthink so. I’m sure a lot of ppl would besatisfied w this info, but I like to know ALL the details, but I w ould want toknow where I would need to go, b/c some ppl live far away from local VBO. Iwouldn’t wantto go thru this process and then find out that I have to drive anhour and a half to see a counselor. 

 

M: w here would you want to know this info in the process? 

P3 on prev page. Maybe a – oh goodness – a quick access linkon the left with the other links, like find a voc counselor, or an office, thatlinks to a palce that shows where avail voc rehab offices are. I just um. Ilive 45 mi from closest VAMC. I  wish Ihad thought about that b4 I moved to Williamsburg, b/c I lived a lot closerthan that before. My voc rehab counselor is 45 mi away as well. I go to medcenter 2-3 times a week. Just for me I woujld like more info about what wouldbe rq,. How far I have to go. That kinda stuf.f but if have that ans, justlooking htru this process here I would be ready to go ahead. I would be readyto start app

 

M: how long is app

P3 – it tells me it will take 15 min 

M: lets go ahead andstart 

P3 – would you like me to fill this out? 

M: sure. [explains prototype info]

[Screen 2/6 Vet Info ]

[issues with the dropdown[]

P3: I see the link here. The save and finish. I assume if Iwanted to save I would need to create an a/c. I saw it at the beginning –should I have created an account? 

M: would you have wanted to? 

P3: I would yes. Websites are a lot easier that way. If thistakes 15 minutes and I don’t have time to complete it, I woujld like to saveand come back later. 

[screen 3/6]

P3 H ve you ever applied? Yes!

[screen 4/6]

user provides service dates for moderator 

M: what would you do if you served 1+ period

P3: I’d click this button – add another service period. 

[5/6]

M: What other info do you think the form is waiting to askyou? 

P3: Um. I’m um. Maybe. What. Honestly I don’t know. Whatother benefits I’m interested in. Or something. Yeah. I don’t know. It’s prettymuch asked me everything already. 

[5 of 6 part 2]

P3 – oh, ok. But none of those are required it looks like. 

M: What would you do if you wanted ot edit

P3 – I would hit the edit button. 

M: What would happen? 

P3 – my assumption is that it would take me back to thescreen and I would have to click thru the remaining pages. I’d have to hit contbutton to get back to this screen. 

M; go ahead and click. 

P3: oh well that’s convenient.

M: talk to me

P3: a lot of pages, for example, when I just filed my taxes,if I wanted to go back to a previous section, I had to click through to go thruall the other pages to get back ot the end. I thought htat woujld happen herethat I would have to click continue to get thry all the other pages. 

M: what will happen when you hit submit? 

P3: Huh. I think it wil. Um. Ask me to create an a/c. checkthe status of my app. And I didn’t provide an email address, buti f ihad donethat, I think the syst would send an email, like receipt email. 

[ conf page]

M: what is this page? 

P3: got my app. Going to process at conv. [laughs]. Maybe ifyou’re … k, so, ok yeah, so it um, it pretty much tells me I have to sit andwait, and it takes a week to process, and I will prob rec something in the mailsaying I qual or don’t with my VRC info. 

 

M: what would you do w this info.

P3 – wll the conf # is important, so I would print the page

M: how long would you wait before calling helpline.

P3 – how long would I wait after submitting. I would givethem at least a week. Hm. So if I had input an email address would I havereceived any kind of confirmation. 

M: Moderator explains … what would you want? 

P3: Of course this would be handy, something like this wouldbe handy, esp if someone doesn’t have a printer avail and isn’t able to printthe page, and got an email with the app received and has all the info with thisconf 3, and that woujld be helpful. If appliocation whent through the process,sif the system would send an email to the veteran as it went through theprocess. I don’t like to wait for the mail. 

M: Would you have put your email? 

P3: yes, I would have. It may have been b/c I would assumethe system wants an email address so it could send notifications. It would be abummer to give my email address but it was never used! 

M: how do you think the other app is different from the oneyou just filled out? 

P3: Um. I have no idea. It’s the chapter 31 is for disabledveterans correct, so I guess it would ask disability rating as anotherverification. 

 

M: just to come back to that elig. Page – this is what youwould see if you clicked on the green button on Ch. 31. Please rd page, and letme know if you want other info at hand before starting app itself. 

P3: so for the other application, did it have this sameinformation here, saying if you signed into your accout here that it willprefill your information ? 

M: Would that make you more likely

P3: yes of course. Esp if I was submitting 2 applications,it would be a lot more convenient, rather than inputting all that info 2x.

M: I’m going to let you select sub specialty for the search 

P3: [user has selected a medical facility using FL.] hmmm. Iwas hoping Lookup VA facilities link, that I could look it up, click on it, andit would prefill for me.
