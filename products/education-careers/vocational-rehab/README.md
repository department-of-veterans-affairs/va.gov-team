# Executive Summary

## User Problem Statement
Veterans want access to their vocational rehab benefits, but it currently requires Veterans to mail in a paper form or submit their application online through eBenefits; as a result Veterans are completing the form with inaccurate information which leads to challenges in process and subsequently creates long wait times for Veterans to receive their benefits.

Note: VRE forms on eBEN are not currently available https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/vre

## Solution Goals

### User Goals
- Easily understand the difference between education and in vocational rehab benefits
- Easily understand the difference between Chapter 31 & 36
- Easily self-submit the form without relying on assistance from the VA

### Business Goals
- Decrease the number of submissions that come through with incomplete information
- Increase the speed of processing of VR&E forms

## Assumptions
We'll be able to find the appropriate technical assistance to help us navigate submitting the form to CWINRS
