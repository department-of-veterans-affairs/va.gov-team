### VR&E static content pages - how to direct users into chap 36 or chap 31


#### Proposed update:

#### Remaining questions:
- Do we need another static content page explaining what Chap 36 & Chap 31 are?
- Currently on this page https://staging.vets.gov/employment/vocational-rehab-and-employment/service-disabled/, we list out different VR&E tracks for Veterans, but it seems confusing because these don't communicate whether they should apply for Chap 36 or Chap 31
- Chap 31's full name is Disabled Veterans Application for Vocational Rehabilitation. It's going to be a very long apply button if we put the full name in there. How can we get communicate that this is the apply button for chap 31?
