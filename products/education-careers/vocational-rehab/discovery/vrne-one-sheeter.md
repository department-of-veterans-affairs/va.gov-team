# Problem
1. Veterans get exposed to Chapter 31 and Chapter 36 via the DTAP program or Student Success on Campus but it is not clear that they understand what the VR&E program is about nor do they get access to the forms to apply for these benefits.

2. Currently the form to apply for vocational rehab (Chapter 31) and educational/vocational counseling (Chapter 36) are paper-based forms which veterans can complete online via eBenefits but requires them to upload a PDF

3. For those veterans completing either forms, they are not completing the form with accurate information which is used to assign their case to the correct regional office and reach out to the veteran to scheudle their follow up including:
- email
- phone
- address

# Solution
- allow veterans to complete 28-1900 form (Chapter 31 - Vocational Rehabilitation) online
  - veteran can complete this form 6 months prior to discharge date
  - veteran can apply if current date = separtation date + 12 years or disability rating date + 12 years (which ever is higher)
  - veteran must have honorable or general discharge status
  - veteran must have 10% or higher disability rating
  - indicated in our copy that veterans who are in already in the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) or in a Wounded Warrior Battalion are automatically elibility for VR&E benefits and therefore should apply
  
- allow servicemember, veterans, and dependents to complete 28-8832 (Chapter 36 - Educational/Vocation Counseling) online
  - service members can complete 6 months prior to discharge date 
  - veteran can apply if current date <= discharge date + 1 year
  - veteran can apply if already receiving VA education benefit
  - dependents can apply if already receiving a VA education benefit
 
# Goals
 - get more veterans to fill out the 31 correctly
 - get more veterans to fill out the 36 correctly (VA has contractors ready to provide counseling if there is spike)
 - train VSOCs on how to get veterans to complete 31s and 36s

# Metrics
- increase completed 31's by XX% (baseline = Y)
- increase completed 36's by XX% (baseline = Y)


To Do
- do some user research on DTAP
- do some user research on VSOC
- get baseline #'s from Josh
