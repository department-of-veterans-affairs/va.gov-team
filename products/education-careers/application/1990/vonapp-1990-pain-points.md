From Chris Marino:
As previously stated this is a rough estimate. Vonapp holds un-submitted claims for 30 days. What I did was look for the top stopping points for anyone claims older than 25 days. Here are the top 5:
 
-	Question 1: The beginning of the form
-	Question 18: Remarks
-	Question 8:  Are you interested in having your VA education benefits directly deposited into a checking or savings account
-	Question 12b-12d (all on the same page): 
  -	Enter the date your training started or will start.  
  -	Please specify your Educational or Career Objective, if known
  -	Course of study to achieve goal?
  -	Type of Education or Training
-	Question 13d-13h: Adding Tour of Duty
 
Thank You,
