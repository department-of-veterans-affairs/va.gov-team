### Narrative
The 1990 is the most popular Edu Benefits form on Va.gov. The application collects user information through the experience on Va.gov and is sent to TIMS via a spool file in a nightly batch. More information about this can be found [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Education/Education%20Benefits%20Apps/README.md#data-flow). 

#### Current Status
The form hasn't had many major updates since it's originally launch. It has received all of the appropriate updates for Save in Progress, Form Prefill, Migrated from Vets --> Va.gov etc. - but futher than that has not experienced any additional structural changes.
