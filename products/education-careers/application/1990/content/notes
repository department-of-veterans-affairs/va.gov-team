In attendance: 

Anne Kainic, DSVA
Caitlin Weber, AdHoc
Joshua Quagliaroli, VA
Ric Arthur, SO Company
Molly Blake, SO Company 

####NOTES:
Anne gave background on the Education Benefits Application Form:  
- 2 versions == 1990 (pdf. form) which is used by about 10% of people
- VONAPP 90% os users submit via this online form. Built several years ago, it needs to be migrated to vets.gov 
- there are a few differences between the two, but generally they are the same. 

- The VONAPP has 'conditional logic' built in so that if a user answers a question one way, new fields open. 
- Caitlin is working on the wireframes for the new vets.gov version which will include some conditional logic. 

- The new form will most likely mirror the HCA that currently resides on vets.gov. 
- Content team needs to review questions, flow, order, how we ask questions, and supporting content (grafs/pages at beginning of app). 

####TIMELINE: 
- Caitlin, Molly, Ric to meet Tuesday 8/23 for working session. Review current forms and what content, specifically, needs review
