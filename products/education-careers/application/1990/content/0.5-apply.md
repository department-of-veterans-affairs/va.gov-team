1. Your information
2. Benefits eligibility 
3. Military history 
4. Education history 
5. Employment history 
6. School selection 
7. Personal information
8. Review 

Fill out this application to get your Certificate of Eligibility (COE), sometimes called a GI Bill letter. You'll need to give this letter to your school's GI Bill certifying official before you start classes. 

You **will not** be able to save your work or come back later to finish, so have this information handy when you begin: 
-	Paperwork related to your military, education, and employment history (such as your DD214)
-	Whether you are eligible for the specific education program you are applying for
-	Which school you want to attend and what you want to study

Fill out as many blocks in the application as you can.  Please be as specific as possible. VA uses this information to determine whether you are eligible for education benefits.
