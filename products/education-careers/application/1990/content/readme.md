# Content Flow

We’re using this directory to create a clean and efficient reference for developers.

Content developers will upload a file for each _story_ they are working on. Wireframes or mockups should have a reasonable naming convention and markdown files should be named similarly (at least include the numbers) for clarity.

Developers will reference this for copy but will look to the wireframes or other prototypes for layout and behavior cues. We’ll try to keep the wires reasonably up to date with copy changes, but this should be the master reference.

Updates can be commited directly to master, no need to deal with branches and merging.

If you are making a big change, or it’s near a deadline, you can tag [@goldenmeanie](https://github.com/goldenmeanie), [@jbalboni](https://github.com/jbalboni), or [@akainic](https://github.com/akainic)

If you have any suggestions for improvements to how we do this, please let me (@goldenmeanie) know.
