2.1 
Benefit waiver

You’ll need to make an important decision on this part of the application.  If you have questions or don’t understand the choice, talk to a specialist at 1-888-442-4551.

Some things to think about:

- You may be eligible for more than 1 education benefit program. 
- You can only get payments from 1 program at a time. 
- You can’t get more than 48 months of benefits under any combination of VA education programs.
- If you are eligible for both the Post 9/11 GI Bill and another program, such as the Montgomery GI Bill – Active Duty (MGIB-AD), you have to choose which one you want to use. 
- Once you make this choice, you **can't** change it. 

I'm eligible for more than 1 program and so I choose to give up:
