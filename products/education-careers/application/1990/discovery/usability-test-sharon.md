# Education Benefits - Round II // Sharon
10/14/2016  //  Testing: Intro page and language, Benefit selection pages and new growable tables

**Facilitator:** Alex  
**Notetaker:** Alex (from recording)

**Note:** Interview wrap-up and recording got cut off by the next meeting starting, but we reconnected by phone afterwards.

***

## Summary of Notes
- How to figure out what benefits to pick
  - Background is helpful but would like an interview style experience to find the right options for applicant based on their situation.
- Saving important and could be emphasized more.
- "Checking on my application..." could be more findable.
- Didn't understand relinquishment.
- Required fields was initially opaque, (but we didn't have good coverage on the key).
- Suggested drop-down or type ahead matching for "Type of service"
- Active duty confused with service periods
- Form outline read as navigation, she was frustrated by being unable to jump back or forward.
- Would like to see more emphasis on who the form _isn't for_.

## Quotes

_Will go back through the recording again to pull some quotes out._

## Interview

### Intro
- Dept. of Army Civilian  
Division Chief, Log Architecture and Documentation Division
- 1985-2013
- Disability rating
- Two deployments
  - Iraq 2004-2005
  - Afghanistan 2011-2012
- Mentioned pretty deep distrust of VA Medical in screener. Mentioned ability to talk about this as a motivation for wanting to get involved, but did not return to topic during session.
- Interested in helping out again!

### 0.0 Application intro page
- Applying for education benefits sounds like it’s for everybody. Not immediately clear that dependent flow is excluded
- Maybe link to form 22-1990
- Check your eligibility. Which one would cover me? There was a point in the past when I had to choose between Benefits
- What happens before eligibility?
- Maybe there is a preamble to eligibility: When did you enter the service? Did you opt to change your benefit, etc. A survey to help guide people into the right benefit.
- Can I click on this GI Bill Comparison Tool?
  - Fills out the survey (thinks it's going to compare GI Bill versions)
  - This is the kind of thing I'm looking for to figure out which Bill
- Clicks on Apply Now
- Go to regional office might link to a tool to figure out which regional office you are under?
- Looking at *Decision* section. What happens if I need to find out how it's working?
  - Had a problem before with an old mailing address when applying for her daughter
  - Had to call a lot. It would have been nice to be able to go online to see "where's my paperwork?"
  - It could be right here (Decision, step 4)
  - When I log onto my bank I can see cleared checks.
  - Maybe after 30 days when I log back in it will say mailed/approved, etc. Something for status.
- Finds status box
  - Maybe this needs to be another color? I just didn't see it. Maybe I need more coffee.
- What's most helpful?
  - Having the bills linked out at the beginning. Also the comparison tool.
- What's next?
  - I'd use that apply now box on the side at the top.
    - It's pretty cool that it's in two places. It's always on the side wherever I go.
    - I like the fact that what happens is that as you scroll down the page, the Apply button stays. That tells me that that's what I do next.

### 0.5 Apply
- Why isn't work saved?
- Maybe use the triangle warning and a yellow or a red for the part about not saving the work.
  - What colors make sense to you?
    - Reds or yellows
    - Consistency, maybe the blue get started button should be green to match the one on the page before.

### 2.0 Benefits eligibility
- The box is helpful. But I still don't really know which one’s I should sign up for?
- How would you resolve?
  - I would open a new tab and research?
  - I have to find which one is right. I would go research before continuing.
#### Relinquishment
- I think you're trying to guide me to which one to use?
- What does the asterisk mean?
  - I had no idea what you wanted me to do. (there is no key on this page)
- Thinks that this is benefit selection, not relinquishment?
- Maybe the comparison tool should be here?
  - No one wants to go back to find out the answer, it should be here.
  - If you are asking someone to make a decision, any tool you have to help make the decision should be on that page

### 3.0 Military service
- Make the required key bigger. (Saw it this time, but had been primed by earlier conversation.)
- Isn't seeing the active duty as separate from military history
- Active duty question should tell you about different options. Maybe you should be using Tuition Assistance instead of the GI Bill.
- We used to have (at Pentagon) an education department on site. But now it's all on the web. Misses the in-person help.
- Liked the way the reveal showed relevant options
- Should link out to the TA site here. [are you getting any other DoD money?]
- Why isn't type of service a drop-down?
  - Should show the examples... unless it's a 1 of n list?
  - Once I select active duty above, the form should only allow active duty in service type
- Why isn’t involuntary duty required?
  - Why do you think it is important? [Me]
    - Stop-loss and stop-move are happening
- What does add another tour mean?
  - I think it's going to take me back to fill out the same fields I just did.
  - I just didn't see that at first [it's miss-labeled]
- There is some good stuff at the bottom of the page. But I didn't see it unless I scroll past continue, which I mostly don't.
  - Maybe GI Bill Comp, etc. could be closer to the top, in context
- Form outline reads as nav, and it's frustrating that it doesn't let me move around.
- Want's to be able to skip something if they don't have enough detail to finish a page.
- Date entered is asking what day I came on service. This doesn't mean day I came on duty. It might be confusing in ROTC? Might be commissioned one day but not be active until later.
- Fixes error with date validation and proceeds.
- How would you enter more than one period of service.
  - Maybe you should have "did you have a break in service?" that would offer a new form?
- I would make it a question: "Did you have multiple service periods?"
  -  People with multiple services know to record that.
- Adds a second period
  - I wish that the type field would auto-complete as I type
- I like the way it lets me add multiple service periods
  - Was confusing, but changing button title should be enough
- Adds a third period and then finds remove option with no hesitation
  - That was intuitive
- Overlapping dates are potentially a problem. Can't be in two services at the same time.
- My application is going to get rejected, but maybe I fat-fingered it. The form should help me see that I've overlapped.
  - Maybe "fuzzy logic" based on reserve status to allow for overlapping dates, but not in other cases.

### General feedback
- On the first screen, transfer of benefits should be called out and directed to the correct form.
- I would like to be able to go all the way back without stepping back through whole form.
- Make the link back to va.gov bigger
  - People may stumble in here and not know where to go.
- Benefit finder to point people to all the options.
