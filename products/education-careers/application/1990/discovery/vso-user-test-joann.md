-- -- --
Joined in 1980 at 17. (airforce) Joined before graduating.

Small town, father refused to pay for college. Joined to pay for college.

Went in open general. Wanted to do photography. Ended up doing dark room, plates stuff.

8 or 9 years?

Went to Alaska. Worst time of life. Intended to go full 20. Hit problems with a female tech sergeant.

Started going to school about a year after. 

Tried to transfers classes from 1982 through all of the different schools.

Chapter 31.

They paid to finish AA.

I am now 5 classes away from getting the Bachelors degree. One of those classes is math!

I’ve had such good experiences with VA websites, but I’d like to see some better things with website functionality, ebenefits or whatever.

Certification with Chapter 31 sometimes gets dropped because the school has to certify it.

I was in a couple of programs.

VEAP had just started when I was in military. They matched it, lots of money, go to school. But they gave up on that and went back to GI bill.

Frustrating because I don’t have GI Bill.

Had to use the $150 I put in within 10 years and didn’t.

Used daughter’s college savings to go back to school.

Applied for VRAP, which was a wonderful program. And applied for FAFSA. Supplemented with on and off jobs. VRAP was much launch off.

Disability then got approved. 10% made me eligible for that program, normally at 20%. (Chapter 31)

I’m old school and a little new school.

(Getting more access for Veterans)
Whaaaat?!?! Get out of town. That’s awesome!

I’m excited to be part of change. Because change can be good for the VA sometimes.

For the new vets it could be fine, for the old vets, maybe not.


### What Edu Benefits are you aware of?
I used 
VRAP
Chapter 31

Wasn’t able to use VEAP

I don’t help at VSO with education benefits. Work study so I don’t work with Veterans directly.

##0.0 Introduce Application Process


##0.5 Start Application

I’m reading. Wonderful. I can see where you’re going with this.

I think it’s important to stress that you can’t save your work and come back later. Because a lot of people expect that you can do that.

Liability release is good!

Phone and web. It NEEDS to be both. There are a lot of people even my age that don’t do things on their phone. I prefer to do things on a screen, because I like to be able to print things and make notes on it.

Reading the footnotes: Likes that!

Reading the footer: “that’s wonderful.

Distracted by what the playbook is.

(Missed the submit button) midway through.

##1 Veteran Information
Middle name or middle initial? Do you need it for sure?

Do you try to fill out everything or as much as possible.

If it says “optional” I don’t necessarily bother putting it in there.

Oh got. “* indicates required field.” so It IS going to require SS.
##2 Benefits Eligibility
I’m going to just say I don’t know.

Is it better or harder for you if I say I don’t know? 

Most people going here don’t even know what they’re eligible for and they’re trying to figure it out.

No. I did NOT know. Because I knew that I was VEAP and honestly I didn’t even think I could have GONE anywhere to find out.

I would move that to the top.
##3 Military History
Not sure why the remove thing is there.

I don’t know my file number for VR&E. If I ever got it, I don’t know what it is off hand. But that’s not required anyway.

Oh, so I can add additional?
##4 Education History
When you say military service academy, what are you referring to?
Well...I was enrolled in the College of the Air Service
NCO Leadership school as well, so I’m kind of confused by that.

Isn’t required, so I would skip it.

I don’t honestly know why you’re asking it.

An officer might be able to answer that if they went to …

I’m not on terminal leave now… I’m confused by that. I don’t know why that pertains to any of this.

Now that I read the bottom of this paragraph, I realize you’re talking about only active duty.

It’s a convoluted question.

This period of service should be counted toward… is confusing. (Did not click to expose more)

Oh it wants you to type year? That’s good.

DD214, people probably don’t know unless they have it on hand.

Service Status, what do you mean by that? I don’t know what it means.

Veteran, retired?...

(I’m thinking like a VSO)

Save: what happened? Oh...autofill? (Can’t tell what screen she is on)

Now there is a new question. ROTC. That was a new question.

Benefits history
I don’t really know the answer to the DOD question so I’ll say no.
##5 Employment History
You might want to warn someone how long this might take in the beginning.
High school graduation. Most people won’t remember the day.

At this point if it were me...I would probably drop this. DO you really need to know this for eligibility purposes? I have about 7 schools...
##6 School Selection
School selection
Are those options what you expected. College or other school at top. Good that it’s a drop down.

Do I have to?
Nope! Because it doesn’t say required.
##7 Personal Information
I see the little asterisk so...
(email address says it’s required, but I think she didn’t fill it out and it worked. )
##8 Review/Submit
It appears to me that you’re asking a whole lot of information for something so simple. Seems like you’re trying to capture too much info.

If you’re talking to a PTSD veteran, I would be a little leary of why you’re asking all of these questions.

What are all of these sections? Can I drill in?

SO this is an actual application for education? Not just checking eligibility?

All of those questions make sense now. All of those things come into play.

If I was a Veteran, would that make me eligible for different types of benefits? You didn’t ask me about that.
##9 Confirmation Page


### Was there any info you expected?


### Anything you would have skipped because you didn’t have the info ready?


Time frame for approval. Would be nice to know exactly HOW I’m going to get communicated with. Vets get confused about how they’re going to get communicated with.

Claims receipt stuff all looks good.

## Think about the last time you looked up phone numbers for VA

I do it on daily basis. Most of the time now because of my work. No home computers, no access. Can’t get through to VA.

### What about the last time you looked it up for yourself?
Phone junky. I save them all in my phone. Got it from a business card or someone wrote it down for me.

VSO from north carolina.
Googled it.
VA website wasn’t so easy to find it there.

### Any other services you use to fine numbers for things?
Google is what I go to because it’s easy.
Wish I had an app for that, but I don’t use my phone for that.
I’m an event planner. A planner, so I think ahead for a lot of stuff.

I wish the VA site was more user friendly, but I’m not sure how it could.

Search function would be good.

## Pretend you have a laptop to get fixed. Try to find a place.
Wrong zipcode! That was my fault.
Edit Ah hah! Duh.

It should find a store now.

### Can you tell about geek squad
I know this store does, because I know this store does.

I would probably go to store details.

Oh. Wonderful! Geeksquad.

Nothing confusing.

### If the geek squad tab didn’t exist?
I would see that they had computer and tablet set up.
In store services AND the geek squad tab.

I usually do a walk-in because it’s like urgent care or ER. It’s normally an emergency.
