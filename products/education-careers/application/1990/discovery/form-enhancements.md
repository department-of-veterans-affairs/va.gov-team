# Form Enhancements

## General Form Enhancements

- **Straw test**: Should the Back button be de-emphasized? For visually impaired, it's taking prime real estate from the 'continue' button.
- Required key sometimes looks like it's might be associated with the first question.
  - Find a way to test required labeling outright
- Remove Subway map content outline (Does it need replaced with another way of creating a sense of place?)
  - Typeform style single page form
  - Preview mode?
  - Preview bar on side of screen like Sublime?
- Form feels disconnected from the page, like a self contained experience. Is this good?
  - Some of the other interactions feel more integrated with the page/template structure of vets.gov
  - Universal error handling/design does not feel like it would integrate as well with the application form
- New review screen pattern
- Saving progress
- Add print stylesheet for application receipt
  - Add print 'link'
- Improved field level things
  - smarter date fields
  - smarter currency fields
  - smarter phone number fields [looks like a phone number as you type, handles - , . , () ]
  - smarter SS fields  [looks like a phone number as you type, handles - ]
  - Better field-width options
  - How fieldsets are being used (html structure)
  - Page title/section titles need distinct styles
