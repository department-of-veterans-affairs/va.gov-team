# Former VCE Interview: E & S

E: former VCE 4.5 years, specialist team doing audits for professional claims. Works with LTS and with web system where Vets can ask qs about edu benefits like a chat line. Decoding side, clarify & fix it, work with contractors on the system. Also GI Bill comparison tool - compare schools & edu benefits. 

### Walk through claims: 

once vet submits, comes to regional office based on school to atned or their home address, VCE receives and a temp phto. VCE reviews for app benefits. Look at numerous systems to see if eligible for benefits. DOD, service period. Gather all info to determine. If eligible for multiple benefits, let them know so they can decide which is most beneficial.

### Multiple benefits: 

A lot already know what eligible for - occasionally don’t know, check every box and VCE needs to refute which they’re not eligible for. Post 911 is straightforward, pretty much eligible for Ch31(?). Ch 33 is one of the best - books, supplies, housing, tuition/fees based on benefit level. 

Other info look for? If vet didn’t submit DD214 with application, VCE needs to second guess. Kicker - lot of vets know what kicker is but don’t know if they have a kick or not, so may say yes but not proper paperwork. VCE needs to look up DOD records for that.

### Vets confused? 

Relinquish benefits - have to give up one benefit to receive another. Relinquish process don’t understand. Ever more than one? Some can Ch 30 & 33, but in order to get 33 you have to relinquish 30. Reserves ch 7 and (other?). 

S: you can be eligible for more than one but can only receive benefits from one at a time.

### Extra work from you from form? 
Service period, kicker. We still have to verify if accurate for eligible. 

### How do you verify? 
DOD records use BDN benefits delivery network. Also use DIS, can’t remember what stands for. Transfer of maternity info (?) 

### Explain the process again?: 

Rec app for ch33 benefits. First review, make sure address matches in our system, name, social. Vet may have put service info, verify with DOD records. Select kicker? If say yes, verify that. Go extra, make sure they’re eligible for 33 based on service period. Then enter into LTS long term solution system to process ch 33 benefits. LTS will process everything, easy transition. If vet select school, verify in WING system that school is verified to get benefits. They’ll get letter to take to uni that says you’re eligible for system. If not approved, let them know school not approved.

WEAMS - web enabled approval management system? - vets information solution = VIS
Web 

### Parts that don’t get used? 

S: ROTC scholarship is rare - each year’s benefits. Not many rec’d. Requires extra steps for VCE if they did get this.

### Get back to applicant with incomplete info? 

If wrong social, doesn’t match, we auto-contact to verify or re-submit. Service info DD410 doc for service - lot of time they don’t submit. Sometimes we can contact DOD but may be couple days delay, might call Veteran to ask to email or write now web submit to go faster.

Relinquishment process - lot of Vets do not understand that process. For Ch 33. 

### Anything you can correct without contacting Vet? 

Can usually go with that’s in VIS or BDN for service info. Conflict eg May 15 vs 17th, not years or anything. If two systems have matching info, we’ll go with what’s in our system.

### Big section: remarks? 
Wasn’t used often, but for Vets who want to be contacted as soon as app processed. Yes, we can, I do (can’t speak for other VCEs) S: not often. Sometimes FAA flight certs, sometimes ROTC scholarship. But when doing reqs for VONAPP - 2290, VDC, took out remarks section.

### Info wish you had? 

S: No. E: can’t think of anything.

### Magic wand: 

Didn’t have issues with the process. S: don’t know, it’s pretty smooth and straightforward.

### Easy/Keep? Everything?

How explain relinquish: just updated form to make language more clear - very legalese. Not very simple way to do that.

Helpful: how like to be contacted for follow-up: phone, email? Lots who may not like calls, some like to be emailed. If any issues, can be contacted this way.

Follow-up: data into spool file, into TIFF file, into  - typed into EDM or other systems
What does TIFF look like? - follow-up in email.
