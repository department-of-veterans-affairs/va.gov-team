Learned about w outprocessing, don’t get into how to apply. Go to the website, here’s how you enroll - very basic. Did greater portion over the phone, initiated online. Found it fairly simple, but have a computer/tech background. DIdn’t have a lot of issues.

Phone was kindof a pain. Getting things done over the phone is a huge pain in the butt. You’re either on hold forever, or it takes forever to get the person you need to talk to. Want a direcorty of who does what and what times they’re available, or a direct line or email contact for individual ppl in certain departments.

Needed to speak to someone in oklahoma, it was finazlign of verifying some info so the school i was attending was getting info correclty and my tuition was getting paid. I had to do something about the VAH part I had to follow up on too - where they pay the housing stipend as long as on-ground courses E5-VAH rate for area of residence. Was getting post911 GI bill.

Would have been good to more clearly say that once service member initiates use of benefts, can’t transfer any to family members. Could have gotten mine taken care of w pell grants & passed on to spouse or something. Not sure if can pass to family member, but once start using none are avail to transfer to family member.

### Hard to find info? 

Not really, app itself smooth. Verifying info after the fact was extra phone calls. Find out when I could expect approval or trying to track down approval date didn’t seem to be online as fas as I could tell. Was pre-emptively checking up on things with school, weren’t coming to ask about it.

### Assistance? 

Folks at school were as helpful as they could be. Liason office to VA, only had access to certain info - yes approved, not a heck of a lot beyond that. Helpful as much as they could be. Did well in their capacity. 

### VA reach out? 

I was initiating pretty much all contact trying to stay on top of it. Process seemed like it went fairly quickly, had to go to office in Oklahoma. Only from app to starting school only a couple months tops. In Washington state, school also here. Office was somewhere in OK, probably around Fort Sill.

### All at once or come back?
App all at once (one sitting). 

### Easiest part? 

Online portion really simple. No phone tag involved.

### Documents? 
DD Form 214 *(Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty)*
Proof of residency.

### Did you hear back from VA? 

I was checking in once a week to hear about progress. Head from them by mail. Email best, phone okay. Faster than postal mail.

### Magic Wand
Want some sort of portal that have everything there. See status like Domino’s pizza tracker - this is the progress, here’s a way you can help move things along, we need this info from you.

Approval status was the big one - this at this rate.
