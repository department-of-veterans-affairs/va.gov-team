## Conversation Guide

### Introduction
Thank you for joining us today. My name is [NAME] and we also have [NAME OF OTHERS OBSERVING] observing and taking notes for this session. We are doing this website feedback session on behalf of the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs working on a new website that will help veterans get easier access to the benefits they deserve.

We're working on a new education benefits application form and want to evaluate a draft version of it today. We want to see what works well, and what doesn’t work well. If your run into anything that doesn't work, that's ok. Just tell us what you expect to do on each screen before you do it and we can help you through any rough patches. We are especially insterested in places where you don't know how you should answer a question.

Before we begin, I’d like to make a few things clear and explain how the session will work.
* We aren’t testing your ability. We’re just trying to figure out what works well on the website, and what doesn’t work well. So there are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions and what you think so that we can make the site better. I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.
* This entire usability test session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question or task.
* We’ll be recording the screen activities as we look at the site. Recording our discussion today will help us capture everything you say accurately.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop, and you will still recieve your $25 thank you.
* As we're going through the session, I'd like you to think out loud.... [demonstrate]
* Do you have any questions at this stage?
* [The moderator reviews consent form with participant.]
* Do you have any questions before we get started?
* [The moderator will begin audio and screen recording, if using.]

### Education Warm-up Questions (5 minutes)
Before we get started, I'd like to ask you a few warm-up questions.
- Can you tell me about yourself? (When did you serve, what branch, job, rank, deployments, discharge, etc.)
- Have you used or applied for any education benefits?
- (If yes) Can you tell me about your experience applying for those? How did it go? 
- What worked well? What was frustrating?
- What different kinds of educational benefits are you aware of?

### Prompts (30 minutes)
_This time we will be testing specific pieces of the form, rather than testing end-to-end._

####0.0 Application intro page
_Show application intro page_

- What are your first impressions of this page?
- What information seems helpful?
- What information are you missing?
- What would you do next after visiting this page?

#### Benefit selection page
- What questions are running through your head as you decide between these options?
- Follow up about selecting multiple: What would you expect to happen?
- Could you try selecting Chapter 33 and continue to the next page?
- What is this page asking you to do?

#### Military history section
_Start participant on first page of military history and let them walk through that chapter. This should have them witness nested content and growable tables, along with some questions that have been modified for clearer language._
- What do you think you need to fill out to finish this task?
- How would you add more than one period of service?


### Wrap-up
