Education Benefits Research Call with B
Call facilitation: Laura
Notes: Caitlin

### Can you tell me a little about yourself?

Active duty 91-95, airforc
Gaurd 96 -2000
...dependent, gets benefits through wife rather than VA. Just looking into edu.

### Could you walk me through the process you went through to get your Education Benefits through the VA?

I had the Montgomery GI Bill, but didn’t use it. Wasn’t ready to go back. It expired, but covered under the post 9-11 bill under wife.
FIlled out paperwork. Letter from VA. You’re not in the system. Filled out paperwork. You filled out wrong paperwork.
Had applied using member paperwork rather than dependent. Refilled out and is still waiting.

### What parts of the process seemed confusing or required extra work?

I had no problem with them. I think maybe for clarification purposes. You’re a dependent or you’re a service member. A ton of dual service. Well, do you want mine or do you want my sponsors?
Grey area of what they’re looking for?
Montgomery GI bill was 10 years from time you get out.
I got out of the military and had to get going to work right away.

### Did you seek advice or assistance from anyone during the process?

Goes through the buffalo office. By social? By location? Buffalo office helped to have him fill out the right form. She was more help than the first time. We’re in the pacific northwest. Trenton, NJ.

### Confusing or extra work?

Which paper work was the confusing bit. Was hoping to be enrolled in classes in a couple of week, but not there yet.

### What was the process like once you had submitted your application?

### If you could wave a magic wand and improve three things in the application process, what would they be? What would the magically improved version be like?

What your status is? Where you are in the process? Seems like process should take 30 days. I mean, pay roll can be processed for an entire org.
Didn’t get in touch during six week waiting period. Well about the same time you’re doing that, we’ll have your transcripts changed over.
Timeframe given was pretty accurate.

### What are the easiest parts of the process that should be kept as-is?

Form online was fairly easy. Just identifying it’s the right form. Form numbers were really close.
