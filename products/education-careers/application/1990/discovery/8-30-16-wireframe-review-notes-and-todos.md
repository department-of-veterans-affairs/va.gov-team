 - Direct Deposit - Clarify who that is required for and who it is not.
 - Consider whether 3 of 7, etc. is conveying the right thing
 - Language around benefit selection is sensitive (Just spent a lot of rewriting and getting legal approval)
 - Make sure "(*) Indicates a required field" is on relevant pages.Should it be on all pages?
 - Consider moving "do not apply period of service" to bottom of each period of service section
 - Month/Day/Year for high school graduation. Can we leave out Day all together? Make sure to accept month/year only.
 - Are there other dates that this is true for?
 - Note about high school should include fact that you cannot begin receiving benefits until you have received a high school degree or equivalent.
 - Check with Shay about leaving out the date in benefits relinquishment
 - Check with Shay about whether the VONAPP only question about receiving benefits under another persons benefits should be included. It currently isn't.

Seemed ok
 - Preferred contact
 - I don't know what I'm eligible for (expose on frontend, but checking all boxes in SPL is fine for triggering the VCEs to doublecheck)
