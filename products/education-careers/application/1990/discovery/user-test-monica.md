# Education Benefits // Monica
dev.vets.gov walk through
9/27/2016

-- -- --

Active duty for four user, Army - Signal corps. Radio teletype operator. Cryptology.

The field or top secret communications

If I told you I’d have to kill you kind of stuff.

Two years in Korea.

Active and then inactive ready reserves for 4.5 years.



I used my GI bill before you could apply online. I went to UCLA and got my degree there.

It was a hug pain in the rear. I also a had a name change and a home state change.

Lots and lots and lots of phone calls. Finally I would get ahold of a person who would mail me an application or request for documentation or proof of enrollment. It took kind of forever because I never had one point of contact that I dealt with. I was dealing with an office.

How long?
I don’t really remember, but probably up to 6 months. I was already in school before I started receiving benefits.

I don’t remember if I got paid retroactively or not.



### What Edu Benefits are you aware of?

Only aware of the GI Bill because that’s what I invested in, applied for and got it.

I understand it has to do with when you served or when you, able to transfer it to dependents, but I didn’t know about that.

I believe I had to use it within ten years of being discharged otherwise it would have gone away. I don’t know if I used all of it, but I certainly used it while I was in school.

##0.0 Introduce Application Process


##0.5 Start Application
##1 Veteran Information
Maybe I could type in a 2 for feb...oh, it’s a drop down.

##2 Benefits Eligibility
I don’t know what most of these things are.

Montgomery, I think that’s the one I had.

CLaim type...I don’t know. Active duty, chapter 30. File number, I have no idea.

Click save.

I would expect that it will save everything I do when I hit continue.

Save onlyif I can come back and finish later. Otherwise I would just assume continue would save and continue.

Usually on a form save means you can come back later.

##3 Military History
I don’t know what other benefits are, so I don’t know what this would be for.

I don’t know the dates, I just remember the year.

Oh. Crap, I have to go look at my DD214, but I probably should have known that I would need that because they always ask for stuff like that.

But then, I would wonder if it is saved, if there is a time out, etc.

The date I ETSed or the date I actually separated. Active, reserve or what?

End term of service. Last day on active duty, but still on contract so you could be called back at that point. Some people think their ETS is their date of separation.

4 years active actually signs you up for inactive ready reserves for 4 years also (3rd in tier to get called)

I would probably look up education benefits on the internet to see if I could figure it out. I might try going to search to see what the benefits were.

I don’t really like calling the VA so I’d just look it up.

Service status, is that honorable? What does that mean?

Discharge status would be honorable/dishonorable, so what does that mean.

She selected active duty as yes again, but she clearly is not. It makes those additional questions confusing.





Benefits History

I don’t know what any of these things are.
##4 Education History
I don’t know. That was like a thousand years ago.

I’ll skip this as though I hadn’t been to school yet.




##5 Employment History

I didn’t do any tech training or anything like that. (I think she assumed the parenthetical made this ONLY about trainings.)
##6 School Selection
Picking a school for funzies.

##7 Personal Information
Would just put mobile number is that’s also my primary.

No dashes...alright

Secondary contact
I would call that emergency contact?

Is this required?
Honestly? I feel like after it’s been approved it should ask these kinds of things.

Routing number: (requires 9 digits even when left blank, but is not a required field)

I would be more comfortable if it had a validator. If you had to enter the number twice. I would hate to have my number go to the wrong account. Matching, with copy/paste disabled.

For instance when I had to do direct deposit for work.
##8 Review/Submit
Tried to clicc on the headers.

There’s nothing there because it didn’t ask me any of that stuff. Nope, they aren’t clicks.

Asking me to review, but beyond gender there is nothing to review.

It asked me all of this stuff, so I would assume it would all be in there?

“Next”

Oh, I see. Huh, alright. So I just clicked next because it said next, but I didn’t know it was going to populate each of the fields I just said wasn’t there.

Instead of next, review this section or review that section.

Found edit easily, but …

Pressed back to try to rest this. Took her to a new page.

It would be easier if all sections were all open with edit buttons.

Or have something that makes next make more sense.

Show edit from the start, below or to the right. Cause, I don’t know. I like to just do things quickly. Having to click click click to find out where i need to edit seems sort of wasteful to me.

##9 Confirmation Page
I should get

A page that summarizes what I submitted
A submission number
A notice that it’s been submitted
A notice that it’s been emailed to you.

Proof of submission: date, application number. Something that I could refer to and hopefully something there would show up and say you’ll be notified in a certain timeframe, or check back here or whatever the follow up process is


### Anything particularly confusing?
Review section looked like nothing to review.

When it asked me what I was going to apply for. I would now better if I just got out of the service now.

It looked like there were 4 or 5 services at the beginning. Maybe there could be links that told you what it was.

### Was there any info you expected?

At first I thought tax forms, but that has nothing to do with this.
SS
DD214, maybe something else from it?

No. I think it was ll there.

Oh, you know what is a biggy for women? Your name when you served vs your name now.

All of my records have my married name and now I’m divorced and back to my maiden name.

But that is with the DOD and not with you guys.

I’ve run into that problem with VA before because name does not match up with Social.

Name at end of service.

Universities all have a locator number. So you can verify that it isn’t just Jo Shmo’s Flight School.


### Other advise?
Maybe on first page something that says, in order to fill out this form, you’ll need the following. 

Something indicating if you can save and go back?
I would hope yes.

I would assume it would time me out.



# Facility Locator 

## Think about the last time you looked up phone numbers for VA
Actually, last week, because I do use medical benefits.

I go to myhealthyvet.gov or org.

If you didn’t know the city that you’re living in, it’s not the most intuitive form. The VA is sectioned off in geographical areas.

LA county is hundreds of miles. These are ALL convenient to where you are, but it’s like 3 hrs from here.


### Any other services you use to find numbers for things?
I usually would go to google. I use chrome as well, so I would just type in Los Angeles VA. 

[google]
This is much easier to look up.

Google Chrome knows where I am. Shows me the facility on the right and I can check the address.

I can typically get better results through web searches than the VA.

[
for instance, the VA closest to me doesn’t have a women’s clinic so I travel further to another one. Would be nice to see a list of services. Great VA healthcare system gives me a general number and you have to get transferred, but it’s often to the wrong one. I’d rather just call the one I was looking for.

My healthy vet, I can request an appointment online. Or I now have the number for my local clinic. Specialist doesn’t populate in the doctors you can contact. I have to physically go to the office and there is only one guy there that can enter that person into the system.

Every time I add a doctor, I have to go back to this schmuck in the basement.

Every time I have a visit in it’s in their system, why can’t it be populated there.
