# Key Findings: Education Benefits usability testing
_weeks of 9/19/2016 and 9/26/2016_

We tested with 4 Veterans how our new implementation for the Education Benefits form (22-1990) is working. These testing sessions also covered some research for facility locators. These Key Findings only cover Education Benefits. The conversation guide can be found here: [ConversationGuide-Aug2016.md](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/kudos-team/blob/master/SecureMessaging/Discovery/User%20Testing/Current%20and%20MHV%20Prototype/ConversationGuide-Aug2016.md)

## Key Takeaways
- HCA style growable tables cause confusion on where you are on the page.
- Questions that ask for unfamiliar information cause confusion, rather than reading as 'this isn't for me'.
- The mechanics of the review section are not clear.
- What things were required vs optional was not clear to anyone, but was only a distraction to a couple.

## What worked
- 1 of 4 people tried to click on the subway map

## What didn't work
- All 4 moved beyond the benefits selection page without reading exposing the Chapter 33 section. We didn't get a chance to see how that worked.
- Service status was not clear to any of the 4 participants.
- "Do not apply this period of service..." caused confusion no matter how we phrased it. 0 of 4 users clicked it, therefore none witnessed the somewhat clarifying hidden language.
- 'Save' as a button name in growable tables caused confusion with not being able to save the actual form.
- The addition of 'active duty' questions caused confusion. (It also seemed like people may have been reading this question as whether they were on 'active duty' during their military service period.)
- Exact dates for high school were hard to come up with
- Paranthetical in Employment section helped to clarify, but also caused some confusion.

## Edge case observations
- Maiden names vs married names can cause confusion with DOD records.
- One person noted that entering a military address for contact information could result in lost mail if they are about to leave the military
- At least one person noted feeling they they were required to select yes or no on radio buttons. (One person asked for a "does not apply" option)


## Quotes
- "It was a lot more writing. Everything was... not put together, but it was close together. So it was kind of jumbled up. This is very spread out, which I like. I like that. There is no confusion."
- "It’s really simple. It’s like, [barney] proof. Military people love that. They love that."
- "You must complete this form in one session would be a concern for me because the computers freeze up, power goes up, distracted and leave desk. I don’t know if there is a way to save because normally we DO do it in one sitting."
- "What can I leave out that *won’t* hold up my claim?"
- "I like the way it’s worded here better than the current version."
- "I’m reading. Wonderful. I can see where you’re going with this."
- "This is really simple. I’m gonna read what I need to read and I’m not gonna read anything else."
- "You see? I’m sure other people do this. I don’t even read the question. I’m almost embarrassed, but that’s what I usually do."
