## Ideas and considerations

 - Follow HCA form design as much as possible.
 - Make it clear who the form is for
 - Design mobile first. (This is not a particularly complex form, so it should be pretty straight forward. (This includes showing prototypes on mobile and testing on mobile.)
 - Employ universal design to ensure full accessibility (color contrast, text size, form label and field placement, etc.)
 - Progress should be mobile-optimized. (Needs to at least give a sense of relative position in the form, if not the full context of what has passed and what's to come.)
 - Present context of full form before application begins.
 - Make sure users know that they cannot save their form and return to it later.
 - Make clear that they will have a chance to review and edit their form at the end.
 - For large text areas, make clear what type of content is expected.
 - Make clear what is required and what is supplemental
 - Note things that may not be required, but would be particularly helpful
 - Provide useful follow up information upon submission of the form

## Form design best practices

#### Be concise
- Keep content clear and concise
- Make as few decisions on the user's behalf as possible
- Use succinct, descriptive field labels

#### Show progress
- Give the impression of ease

#### Be clear and informative
- Consider the context
  - Familiar vs. foreign
  - Frequently used vs. rarely used
- Ensure consistent communication
  - Errors, Help, Success
- Prepare users ahead of time if information that's difficult to obtain will be required of them
- Create distinct section groupings with informative headings and clear instructions
- When possible, describe the value of the information they're being asked to provide
- Ask questions as directly as possible
- Avoid generic words such as “Submit” for actions - state what actions the buttons do when clicked
- Provide feedback both when an action is in progress and when it has been completed
- Required fields:
  - If most fields are required: indicate optional fields
  - If most fields are optional: indicate required fields
- Offer help and tips when asking for unfamiliar data, or when data should be provided in a certain way

#### Make inputs usable
- Use radio buttons rather than dropdowns when a field has 5 or less options
- On mobile, match the keyboard to the type of input (standard keyboard vs. keypad)
- Match text field lengths to their input - e.g. zip code should be the width of 5 characters
- Let the computer, not the user, handle information formatting
- Explain any input or formatting requirements
- Use smart defaults where appropriate

#### Mobile considerations
- Keep forms to one column - conforms to a mobile setting and provides better overall scanability and accessibility
- Use alternatives to dropdowns where it makes sense
