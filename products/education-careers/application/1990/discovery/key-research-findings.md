# Key research Findings

### Make clear the implications of their application
_Education benefits are valuable, but the limits that get triggered upon initiating benefits can be frustrating._

 - Who is this application appropriate for? There are similar applications, with similar application numbers for dependents using the benefits of their sponsor. (22-1990N and 22-1990E)
 - The implications of submitting this application needs to be clear. This includes relinquishing other benefits that you may be eligible for. It also impacts your ability to later share your benfits with dependents.
 - Is submitting the application committing them to using their benefits or will their eligibility for other benefits remain as long as they don't enroll with the benfits they just applied for?

### Set expectations
_The form is simple, but the review process is a black box._

 - If tracking cannot be provided, set clear expectations for when to expect results and how they will be received.
 - Make expectations for processing time accessible after application submission.

### Provide opportunity to help expedite the process
_The inability to check on the status of the process can be frustrating, but the feeling of participating in expediting it as much as possible is appreciated._

 - There are many parts of the form that are not required, but several things that will very explicity help to expedite the process if the information is provided.
 - Providing a school location helps to direct the data to the right location, but it also allows the VCEs the chance to verify that the school is accredited in the appropriate way which can expedite things for the veteran.
 - While many things in the application will get verified manually by the VCEs, the items that cause the most trouble are service history and kickers. These need to be checked against DOD records which can take time to get access to. If the applicant provide official documentation, that step can be skipped.

### Optimize for communication
_Veterans are using the remarks field to express confusion and ask for communication upon receipt._

 - Without tracking, status is discovered by making calls, but finding the right person can be difficult. Provide information for follow-up questions at submission time. This can include likely regional office location. Make this informatin available on return visits to the application as well.
 - Can we add a field to the form to ask for perferred form of communication? Official communication of eligibility approval may need to happen by mail, but the process of verification by VCEs could be expidited by knowing how a veteran prefers to be communicated with.

### Allow for uncertainty
_Many of the fields in this form are not required._ 

 - Be clear about what needs to be included and what does not.
 - Most applicants know what benefits they are eligible for, but for those that don't there is no way to proceed other than to select a random assortment and wait for the VCEs to doublecheck.
 - Adding an option for 'I don't know what I'm eligible for' would trigger the right kind of support and verification from the VCEs.
