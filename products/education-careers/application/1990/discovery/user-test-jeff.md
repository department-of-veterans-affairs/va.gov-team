# Education Benefits - Round II // Jeff
10/11/2016  //  Testing: Intro page and language, Benefit selection pages and new growable tables

**Facilitator:** Alex  
**Notetaker:** Caitlin

## Summary of Notes
 - Was interested in how to get help or ask questions, especially on the first page.
 - He suggested chat, and pointed out that for people who are still on dial up and have no cell phone, chat works better since you're already using the phone line for internet. Also mentioned hold times and other phone difficulties.
 - Thought the other ways of applying should be higher up on the page for folks that need to apply a different way. (Dependents, etc.)
 - VA Black hole: Interested in knowing where his application was going to get sent before he even started the form. Assumed it would go to VA regional offices (Different than Education regional offices.)
 - Wanted ability to save
 - Entered dashes in SS#. Responded ok to the error message/styling
 - Didn't notice red 'required' asterisks until he was concerned/anxious about a particular field and then those asterisks added to the anxiety. (Not necessarily interpretted as 'required field', but maybe more as 'This is important. Don't screw it up.')
 - Thought benefit selection and benefit options had already been customized for him based on his birthdate.
 - Tried to use subway map as navigation, then used browser back button, but it took him back further than expected
 - Wanted information about each benefit at the benefit selection page.
 - Service status was unclear. Noted that it felt like the form was made for people who are currently in the military, not retired, disabled, etc.
 - Thought "involuntarily called to active duty..." was referring to draftees
 - Confused by growable tables, but it was wrapped up in trying to find an answer to what the Q14 meant. Missed/didn't understand error message for "do not apply..."
 - Wasn't tying the edit/remove/update to the Tour of Duty record specifically.
 - Didn't see the remove option after he accidentally added a new tour because it was below the screen and he hadn't scrolled yet.
 - Didn't understand that he was adding a new tour (read card with edit button as a header?)

### Quotes

“Here would be something that I would tell you with a great deal of certainty that the benefits waiver would be very confusing. And many people would either get out because they don’t understand it and not finish their application because it’s intimidating or they would go about it selecting the wrong thing.”

“Educational benefits for veterans or active duty is much like the tax law. Very confusing.”

“Well jeez, what else am I eligible for and which would be the better choice for me?”

“That red asterisk is clearly saying, this is a serious thing.”

"Would adding another tour of duty qualify me for another type of education benefit?"

“I’m going to panic and not choose either and continue.”

## Intro
21 years enlisted in 8 retired in 99.

Private, CW3
Multiple deployments
I did use vocational rehabilitation. CH 31, CH 35? I don’t know what it was.

Used it in 99 to help earn a Master's.

I was still active duty going through the out processing regiment. Part of that was meeting with a VA rep and doing certain things. The expectation was to have a disability rating of at least 30 percent. I was preapproved. I think I still have that letter around here somewhere.

Was I was approved and into the VA system it was just a matter of selecting the college and course of study. The VA did the rest.

Seemed like a fairly seamless and painless process.

### Paper or online?
Everything I did was on paper.

### Were there any hiccups?
No. I don’t recall any significant problems at all.

VR&E. What other programs were you aware of.

First covered by VEAP

Got out and went back in. I think I was still covered by VEAP.

Military in conjunction/VA transitioned to whatever version was current then. I took advantage of that.

Tuition assistance programs. Apply, if you’ve got it they’ll pay 75-90% of tuition. I took advantage of that as well as much as I could.

I had the GI Bill that applied to me. I used that as well.

##0.0 Application intro page
Looking at the steps and reviewing.

I would have dialed into the VA homepage. Probably would have been a header or banner listing healthcare benefits. I would have selected education benefits because that’s what i was interested in. Would I come directly to this page?

Apply for. 

Check eligibility.

What I need to fill.

And then apply. Ok.

I don’t like to use the term ‘dumb it down’, but I will say ‘grunt proof’.

Under apply maybe say ‘gather these things and have them right next to you.’

You’ll see a lot of people that have mental health issues that might not grasp that it’s important to have those things.

Based upon my use of the VA website. The content and structure wasn’t really bad, but I think a little hand holding isn’t bad.

In more modern times, a circle with a question in it? So they could click and see what it means?

He would begin to apply and see what happens.

I’m a little surprised that VEAP is still up there though.

I thought at one time you either had to convert or it would go away.

Is the 1-800 number a dedicated VA #? (This was a case where I had removed the 888-GI Bill mnemonic –Alex)

The reason I asked that question is there are a lot of GIs call the other number 827-1000 and get services down, etc.

Is there also a chat option?

I know ebenefits has a chat option.

If they had a question they could try to contact someone, connect and get back to the application.

I’m in rural NY state. Not everyone has a high speed internet. Some people still have dial up and some do not have cell phones.  If there is a chat option that won’t disrupt the connection.

Each of us veterans have what is called a regional office. When I go in here, whether it’s chat or filling out the application, does it go to a central bucket and then be routed out. Is there a centralized VA thing somewhere?

(VA regional offices are different than Education benefits regional offices.)

How does it make it’s way there?

Would help clarify that this will automatically go to your VA regional office. There’s a lot of misunderstanding. They take on other veterans problems.

In light of that, once completed it will be sent to YOUR regional office. It doesn’t just disappear into the big black hole of the VA.

It would make me feel better if I knew where it was going.

Are those apply things redundant? Should they be somewhere else on the page?

The apply button stays there no matter where I go on the page and I think that’s cool.

(Maybe still not clear that this application is only for SOME things.)

Some may check their eligibility, but me, I would just start the application.

I think that, again, holding hands is going to be important. Somewhere on that page, a note that says you will not ….ok. I see it on this page.

##0.5

Why can’t we save it and come back?
Some are single parents. Some are going to sit down in the middle of the day, the phones going to ring and they’re going to need to come back.

##1.0 Veteran Info

Entered dashes into the SS (error showed, but hasn’t fixed it yet. Continuing with phone)

It’s good that it came up red like that. It’s standard protocol, that’s a good alert.



##2.0 Benefit selection page
The first thing I notice is that if you have questions about this, there’s a phone number.

Is it the same number on the first page?

“Educational benefits for veterans or active duty is much like the tax law. Very confusing.”

Is it showing me that BECAUSE….I haven't given them my status… is this based on my date of birth?

Hmm.

“Here would be something that I would tell you with a great deal of certainty that the benefits waiver would be very confusing. And many people would either get out because they don’t understand it and not finish their application because it’s intimidating or they would go about it selecting the wrong thing.”

Perhaps a link here so that if they needed to verify and get clarification.

Here the statement says.. (part II)

Is this saying I am indeed eligible for another benefit program or should it say I ‘MAY’ be eligible.

“Well jeez, what else am I eligible for and which would be the better choice for me?”

Many of us can do the research and figure it out, but that’s where the chat option would be helpful.

Should talk to a counselor, rather than choose the wrong thing and be angry at the world and myself for making the wrong decision.

(Tried to touch number one to go backwards.)

How do I go back here? Clicked back in the browser. Opened it in new tab.

### What kinds of question would be running through your head when you’re looking at this page?
Well...you know, part of this is hopefully the service member or veteran has already determined which one is best for them.

More than one way to skin a cat.

After each of these selections, put a link to somewhere that has information at each of those things.

Or a date range of service that helps quantify eligibility.

Or if I selected 

To me it’s not too awful bad.

These things can be intimidating. If you can idiot proof it without being too intimidating.

Perhaps a means test up there that says: veterans that qualify for this…

They could go back to the application and select something else.

### What would you do if you didn’t know
Same list was on the first page. 

Lower education, anxiety and intimidation. I would make it less frustrating, spoon feeding operation.

I think maybe what I would have done is call that number or use the chat.

If there was a way that you could quickly address the eligibility for this particular benefit. It might reinforce their…If not, they could go back to the other page and select another thing.


### Describe what this page is asking you to do
Part 1
Well jeez, I have to choose one, I may be eligible for others that I may be foregoing…Other than that it’s simple and easy to read.

Part 2
Two things that raise a lot of anxiety.

“That red asterisk is clearly saying, this is a serious thing.”

A all of those things don’t apply to them 

or B… Fear that the VA is not going to help them.

Once you pull the trigger, it’s done. They really need to know what they’re selecting.

## Military history section
Service status...well… I look at that and I would say, can you type in anything? Can I type in Donald Duck?

[Capital R...e and it refreshed the page.]

Would type retired. Someone may put ‘disabled vet’

Makes me feel like this is only for active duty. People that are participating in the military now, not people that are retired, disabled, etc.

Involuntarily...why this question? Is it going to point toward draftees that might be from Vietnam or Korean?

Would lead me to think that it’s a different type of educational benefit.

I’m going to put does not apply?

I was an advisor trainer to a national guard unit. Those guys are not fully militarized. They might answer yes. But that’s not the truth, we’re talking about the enlistment.

Again, when you talk about tours of duty. They looking at this question and they want to answer correctly. They’re going to be looking at these questions very very closely.

Maybe I’m overthinking it. I don’t know.
I don’t know what the means.

I’m thinking that...these guys are not experts in this. Not by a long shot.

If you’re active duty they used to have an education center you could go get help at.

If you’re a guy like me. Oh it should?

When in doubt...click it.

There’s that red asterisk again…

Add another tour. Is that what I think that is? A chance to go look at those other programs.

That might give me more information?

Is that giving me a chance to change things that would then give me different options?

Either that is…

Oh, like add another tour of duty. It sent me back up...

[**Notetaker's thought:**Tour seemed to be interpreted as ‘explore the site’]

They may have had multiple branches of service. Their newest tour of duty, whenever they selected that education benefit it should have ruled out another.

Would adding another tour of duty qualify me for another type of education benefit?

[**Notetaker's thought:**summary explanation of how benefits are calculated? ...time, active, reserve, etc. ...we will review your...]

[**Notetaker's thought:**Scroll up should display header.]
[**Notetaker's thought:**Maybe a new header for this section that says ‘add a tour’]

We’ve determined that there was an error...so should I edit something?

When you put wrong data it in it should tell you, but I’m not seeing anything.

No. I don’t know what the mistake is. I see edit, I don’t need to edit anything

Red asterisks jump out to me. I would go back and make sure I put the correct thing.

Well, um. Ok. I wasn’t sure. I didn’t know what add another tour meant. That sort of prompted me. I could say from 85- whatever in the coast guard.

How do we prevent people from getting to this point?

How can I go back to where I was without losing any data?

[**Notetaker's thought:**Maybe add remove to top instead of bottom]

My instinct would be to scroll down and click back at the bottom of the screen and hopefully that would take me to that previous page.

I’d have to think about how far back it took me.

I would have preferred that it only kick me back.. Maybe this would be it.

I’m seeing that it has Coast guard there, but there’s no data so it’s not gonna hurt anything, right?

[**Notetaker's thought:**There WAS a problem with the data. Errors were hidden inside of coast guard. Showed up on continue.]

No or do not apply are maybe the same thing?

I’m not sure about this period of service counting toward another...Oh… Ok. 

To me… the update or remove. It could be as innocuous as this means update my application or it could be telling me to update the information I entered. Remove gives me anxiety.

“I’m going to panic and not choose either and continue.”


## What else?
I do like the flow as it’s going through it. Visual aids for whoevers doing it.

I’m wondering if there’s a way to preview the information ahead of time. Save would help. You could save, exit and come back.

I do like the flow and look. It’s not too busy to pull my attention to other things.
