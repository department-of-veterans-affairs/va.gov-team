Joined at 19. (2012) Medically retired and got out in 2014. Vocational rehab. Program called ____. Full time is whatever doctor says. Right now that is 3 credits.

I use my healthy vet.

I know the ins and outs of teh VA pretty well for a 23 year old. Most people don’t use itto get all of their benefits, but that’s their problem, not mine.

When I was still in service. Educational building at Fort____. We did the online application. That’s how I did it when I was still in the service.

Two months later when I got home there was a letter to come in. Went to DC for appointment.

I can’t remember if it was GI Bill or VOc Rahbe. I’m prettysure it was Voc Rehab.

They set me up with Jason.
I hated Jason, he was a dick. 

After I got set up with Michelle it’s been like smooth butter that you’ve left out.

Jason was a voc rehab counselor for NOVA. SO many people complaining about him. That was a really bad experience. I had to call his boss a bunch of times.

It was so simple I don’t even remember applying.

Vdap? V something. You just put your information in and they let you know whether you’re entitled or not to benefits.

We did everything online.

I had to go to a hospital. I didn’t have a Primary Care.

I had to fill out this piece of people.

I mean, it was pretty tedious. My council isn’t letting me do exactly what I want to do, but there are ways around it and they’re looking into your best interests.



### What Edu Benefits are you aware of?
GI Bill
post 911 - It’s the big thing.

I know quite a lot.

With Voc Rehab. They’ll extend my ___

For Voc Rehab they give you a computer and printer, they’ll pay for school supplies. Reimburse for parking.

GI Bill they give you a 1,000 dollars. I think that’s how it works. I’m not too sure about that.

I had already chosen VOc Rehab when I was in the military. I just went and applied because she said that’s better. I’m pretty sure that’s how I did it.

##0.0 Introduce Application Process


##0.5 Start Application
Looks very simple.

I’m not one to read every little detail.

I see the bold. I see form 22-1990.
Reading the blue before I read anything else.

This is really simple. I’m gonna read what I need to read and I’m not gonna read anything else.
##1 Veteran Information
Filling in all fields (including suffix)




##2 Benefits Eligibility
Is this the phone version.
I don’t like the scroll thing

Vocational Rehab isn’t here. Chapter 30 is vocational rehab, I’m pretty sure. People don’t know their #s.

Voc Rehab is what I call it. It’s a mouthfull.

If I press add will it add another one?
(scrolling is causing problems)

It does! I was right!
##3 Military History
I was in … I started in 2012 and finished in 2014 (confused about this) (was in a military academy)

It looks really good.

Is this similar fields to what you remember filling out on your forms?

It’s nothing like (that)[the old form].

I mean, it was a lot more writing. From what I remember. Everything was close together and jumbled up. This is very spread out. I like that.

There’s no confusion

It’s really simple. It’s like, [barney] proof. Military people love that. They love that.

Sometimes I forget what year I went in.

So service status meaning...active reserve, or what?

Does it mean no one pressured me to go in? I guess I’d say not applicable. I just...I guess, I’m sorry. I’m not really sure.

Continue!

Benefits History
No problems.
##4 Education History
I don’t know the day. (high school graduation.)

How many things do you have to enter?

Is this before military or after?

A lot of people are older and did school before and then they went in and did a couple of schools after.

Isn’t stressing about skipping the days for education dates. (errors are not being thrown.)

She’s skipping straight to add instead of save. Save didn’t work.

Ya’ll want me to make some days up. Ok.

Probably mid-month, I’d say.

What does that mean, FAA certificates? (Are things that are unfamiliar distractions?)

save/add error fixed somehow

If someone doesn’t know it... (what was the error that fixed something?...)

Add button and second education history added.

Education history is real, but dates are completely impossible to recall.

If you didn’t know for real, what would you do?
I would made it up.
##5 Employment History

No.

Is that what you expected to see? The description was in parenthesis.

Do you hold a license...I’m not sure. I just don’t normally see that in the employment history part.
##6 School Selection
Oh oh oh oh oh oh.

Northern Virginia

Um...address, [omg]

8333 Little…(She actually remembered this.)

I didn’t have to answer a question like this. It was just like, ‘take classes’.

Maybe something like or ‘already attending’.

Benefits. Usually first time for school or second time from like 5 years ago.

‘Didn’t go’ (what’s up with our buttons?)


##7 Personal Information
I’ve gotten some emails from VA. It’s usually by mail.

I had an ebenefit. I changed my address, but they forgot to. They put down in ebenefits that veteran was missing.

Sometimes email is better...

Secondary
Do I have to write something? Oh no. I don’t !

You see? I’m sure other people do this. I don’t even read the question. I’m almost embarrassed, but that’s what I usually do.
##8 Review/Submit
“It was right here on the app” (I missed what that was too.)

I mostly look at my information and not what they wrote.

Expanding suggestion from her.
I don’t like it when it’s all in one thing.

But that could be more simple for veterans because they might be too lazy to click the button.

Employment history was weird about the licenses.

If it doesn’t matter, you shouldn’t have it there. Some people have been in the military so long, it 


You didn’t ask anything about work-job training. To me, employment history is related to that.

If I’m applying for this, I haven’t used it before most likely, right?

I can’t remember what it said or how it said it.

Some people don’t KNOW what they’re eligible for.

A lot of people don’t like school and they don’t want to go to school, but if they can get a license I’m sure they would be interested in it.



##9 Confirmation Page
I expect “thank you for applying.

Email or something in the mail when you know what you’re eligible. You know, something like that.

If you have questions, the number should be right here.

WHat if I made a mistake on my application, what should I do?

(Jeff seems to have changed how the submit button works.)



### Was there any info you expected?


### Anything you would have skipped because you didn’t have the info ready?






# Facility Locator 

## Think about the last time you looked up phone numbers for VA

I didn’t just show up one day.

I think I went to the VA.gov website.

I think I went to locations in of vet centers.

I don’t even know exactly how I made an appointment, but I’m sure I called to talk to some people.

### Any other services you use to find numbers for things?
Oh, I go to Yelp. Mostly that’s it.

## Pretend you have a laptop to get fixed. Try to find a place.
Went to Google then Yelp.

What I like is that it’s an app on my phone. It’s not a weird version.

SO many options. If I don’t like what it gives me there are so many options.

It says geek squad in the review.

The reviews I love! Only two stars, but if I have time I might go to another one that’s further.

There’s an website I use on my phone that has VA offices with different reviews and response times.

It’s not an actual app, it’s just a saved website.

### Can you tell about geek squad

Or I might filter by services.
There’s geek squad services. And solution central, I might select that one to see what it is.
That tells me store locations.

I like that there’s a map.

It says where it is and gives the City.

I wish it’d give me like 5 locations or something. It should give me more options. I like a lot of options even if I don’t use them.
