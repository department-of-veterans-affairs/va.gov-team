# Questions 8/17
- Currently VONAPP does not require content in any of the fields to proceed. Are there minimum required fields for submission? (This is harder to test.)
- In our initial meetings, we discussed how infrequently document uploads are used. Can we proceed on this form wthout giving the applicant the option to upload files?
- Is submitting the application committing them to using their benefits or will their eligibility for other benefits remain as long as they don't enroll with the benfits they just applied for?
- Can we direct people to a digital resource for acessing their own kicker document or dd 214 on vets.gov or elsewhere? (for upload, perhaps not, but for doublechecking accuracy of dates?)
