What VA benefits
VR&E back in 2000/04
Very helpful. No complaints about it.
Home loan guarantee years ago.
Work with people trying to get into Ebenefits, education benefits.
Haven’t received anything since VR&E.

When I applied for it, office, Voc rehab counselor. DIscussed disability, discussed what could or could not do. Middle school would work for sitting. AA and BA. Stipends were paid on time. SUpplement for supplies. Also paid for any type of material for internships at base school. All paper forms.

### Working with others
The most difficult thing with veterans is trying to FIND the VONAPP program. Not easily accessible from ebenefits. Some steps are confusing. We didn’t know there was a cut off date where they could not choose to transfer to post-9-11 if they had initially elected the montgomery GI Bill.

Once you get through the forms (Which form to select can be tough.)

Montgomery GI and Post 9-11
If you came into military prior to this date with only one enlistment, Mont GI, you cannot change it.
If you select Post 9-11, it does tell you you have to stick with it.
At application time, they don’t know which one is the best for them.

Question about civilians/spouses getting paid. Yes, no, but no ‘not applicable’.

### What Edu Benefits are you aware of?

Montgomery GI
Post 9-11
VRE
Reserve
National Guard

Take to veterans website. Gibill.va.gov. Talk through them there. Help button on website does give them more informations.

Other than honorable discharge - confusion about if they have served honorably, but on second contract not sure if they rate it for the chance of getting benefits.

VRE - on website it says that if you’re anything other than dishonorably discharged..confusion. Other than honorable discharge, we go to the website to find the info. Get in touch with a VA rep.

Ratings based on multiple periods of service where one is Other than Honorable DIscharge

VR&E, most people have a counselor that helps them with it. You have to go online and apply first instead of being able to pick up a phone and ask questions.

Wanted to click on subway map. Didn’t ask to scroll.

Was reading through no saving.

“I don’t have my DD214, what can I do?” - I tell people just to continue.

If it says it’s required, it puts them at a stopping point if they are transitioning out of the military

For some, they aren’t sure what school they are ready to attend. They just want the certificate of eligibility so they have it on hand.

##1
“This is the first dot from the white sheet I was looking at”

You must complete this form in one session would be a concern for me because the computers freeze up, power goes up, distracted and leave desk.

I don’t know if there is a way to save because normally we DO do it in one sitting.

But they could save it and go back (case: do more research about which benefit to get.)

What can I leave out that won’t hold up my claim? (maybe call help desk, but the wait lines are way too long. 1 hour+ before hanging up and getting frustrated. I understand chat is a little easier to get through.)

##2
This is where I would concerned if someone can’t transfer Montgomery GI to POst 911 once they’ve made the selection.

How do people usually find out?
They find out when they try and find out they can’t do it.

Start out at Community college with Mont GI and transfer to university and stuck with that bill.

If you don’t know to ask the question, you’re not going to find out the answer. Most people would not know to ask if I came in after a certain date am I eligible to select one and transfer it later.

### Post 9/11
Telling us about decisions. 

These are some of the ones she mentioned before. Are they changing the number of months? It’s always been 36 months before.

### Did you expect to see this?
Yes, because some of it is on the previous website.

I like this version better, (Giving up MGIB is good!)

GI Bill, clarified by saying Chapter 30.

What date am I supposed to put in? (It’s the date you’re filling out the form. Three months from now? If I change my mind between now and three months from now is that an option?)

What’s the purpose of the ones underneath it? (repeat of previous screen.  Expanded vs changing screen. If I could see the whole screen it might have been clear.)

I have seen people try to use it on their phones. I’m not sure what kind of luck they’ve had. People that do it on phones aren’t usually the ones that ask me for help.
##3
DO not apply… Had a prior enlistment and are now getting out under an OTH. This is not something I’ve seen previously. (does it apply to reserve status or something else?)

Service status is self explanatory.

Save will save the screen and take me on.

One is for standard one is for officers?

What about multiple enlistments.

“It took us to the next step” (after save)



### Benefits History
$600 contribution question is a vast improvement because a lot of people don’t know what the kicker means.

I like the way it’s worded here better than the current version. 

Help button. Some people don’t know if they’ve put the $1200 into the montgomery GI bill. Looking at contract.

Feels like needs to click yes or no on yes/no radio buttons
##4
Is there a not applicable button for those who have not completed any high school
##5
Self explanatory, continue

##6
I would like to see more of an explanation (and see the options in dropdown)

Whether or not there are apprenticeship programs, on the job training, internships

I like “it’s ok if you don’t you don’t have to”

Is this possible to go back an edit? This is important for retirees who don’t know where they will be living.

If I put my military address in here, will something get sent there and never make it back to me. (Maybe change to permanent address)

Other contact info all looks pretty standard

##7
Direct deposit was standard.
##8
I don’t remember seeing secondary contact previously.

I don’t remember this from previously forms, but I leave them on their own when it becomes self explanatory.

Military address is concerning again.

submit
##9

Pretty self explanatory. Is it going to go to their email address?

### Was there any info you expected?
No that I can think of.

### Anything you would have skipped because you didn’t have the info ready?
No, most of it is common knowledge. Address of the school is the only thing I wouldn’t have.

They would get some confirmation and certificate of eligibility for school. 
And it’s up there. One month. That is a question we get.

This IS to get that certificate of eligibility, correct?

If I DO put in a school name, will the school be notified that it’s approved? I think it should be.
