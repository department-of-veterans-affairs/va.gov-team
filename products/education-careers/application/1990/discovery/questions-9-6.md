Questions for Shay

1. Is there an average time or timeframe that benefits eligibility applications are processed in? 12 days? 6 weeks? (We don't want to promise a specific day, but if it's possible to give a general timeframe, that might help manage expectations.)

    - Kicker document: Always, if they have a kicker?
    - DD-214: Only certain cases?
    - Only really useful if a VCE contacts them to request it.
3. We are thinking about highlighting "helpful" fields that can speed (or ease) processing. These are the ones we know about, are there more?

    - Date of GED (only if no HS graduation)
