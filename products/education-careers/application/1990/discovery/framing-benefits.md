### Can I be eligible for more than one benefit?

You can be eligible for more than one benefit.  However, you can only receive paymment under one benefit at a time. 

_*EXAMPLE:*   A person who serves three years of active duty, contributed $1,200, and is honorably discharged is eligible for the Montgomery GI Bill – Active Duty (chapter 30).  If the person then signs a six-year contract in the Selected Reserve and is actively drilling, he or she is also eligible for the Montgomery GI Bill – Selected Reserve (chapter 1606).  Additionally, the person may be eligible for REAP (chapter 1607) if he or she is called-up for active duty from the Selected Reserve.  If any of the person’s active duty service is after September 10, 2001, the person may be eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill (if the person gives up eligibility under one of the other benefits)._

## How the process currently works
- Veterans are able to select multiple benefits on the form
- Veterans are not explicitly encouraged to select multiple benefits
- In some cases their selection is framed in a way that makes it seem like they should only select one of the benefits
- If a veteran selects multiple benefits, VA will check their eligibility for the benefits they checked.
- If they are eligibile for at least one of the ones they checked, their eligibility will be confirmed and communicated to them.
 - They will receive a Certificate of Eligibility
 - Or if they are eligible for more than one benefit, based on what they checked, they will receive and explanation and a request for them to choose which benefit they would like.
- If a veteran is eligible for a benefit that they did not select on the form, this will NOT be discovered during the VAs process
- If they select all boxes, VA will check their eligibility for all of those benefits.

## Remaining questions
If a person is eligible for three benefits, including Chapter 33 and relinquishes 1 of the 3 benefits in order to receive Chapter 33, what happens to the third benefit? Does it remain available for use at a future time?

## Paths forward

1. Add 'I don't know' check box (adds new field to SPL, new process needs to be added to VCE workflow)
1. Add 'I don't know' check box (checks all boxes in backend to trigger whatever process currently exists for dealing with this)
2. Add language that allays concerns about moving forward with the form if you don't know exactly what you want. (e.g. "Select the benefit that is the best match for you. If you are eligible for more than one, we can help you make the best choice.")
3. Suggest selecting the benefit that is most often the best choice (Chapter 33)
4. Check Chapter 33 (the best and most frequent benefit choice) by default ["If you have service after 9/11 this might be the best option for you"]
5. Remove the question entirely and change the process so that VCE always check whether veterans are eligible for any of teh 4 benefits.
6. Default to all benefits, but provide a path for 'super user' veterans to select exactly what they want. Encourage this as a way to expedite the process.

## Expressed and inferred concerns
- 'Duty to assist' was mentioned in the context of the benefit selection process
- Some VCEs do the extra development now, some do not. (Perhaps a question of whether current staffing can handle the pressure of the work)
- Checking for all benefits for all veterans is too much work
- Implementing change in process is more than we can take on right now

## Constraints/Goals
- The veteran should be able to acquire a Certificate of Eligibility.
- The veteran should be able to learn or confirm what benefits they're eligible for.
- The workload of VCEs shouldn't increase astronomically.
- The process for receiving a Certificate of Eligibility should not increase.
- The process will continue to require manual validation of data.
