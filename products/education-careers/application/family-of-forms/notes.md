Initially was denied benefits, and had to apply multiple times through VONAPP, and has pointed other people to VONAPP since then.

> One of the things the VA does is take a Vet who has a common 'language' from their service and make them use a new 'language' to facilitate _their_ internal work."
 * Thought the form looked much nicer than VONAPP, from what he saw
 * Was interested in the integration or replacement plans with different tools like eBenefits.

Applied for benefits in the early 1970s and remembered the process as easy to apply for, but hard to get the stipends. Went through VR&E where they did more than just help get education benefits, also helped with resumes and job training.
 * Liked that the required documents and info was listed at the start
 * Unsure of what 'National Call to Service' was and believed it was a term that came about after he left service. Wasn't sure how to answer the required question.

Applied with a paper form at an office with the help of VA Staff via VR&E.
 * Also didn't know exactly what 'National Call to Service' meant
 * Wanted to know if there was a number he could call if he got stuck or was unsure of how to answer a question.

> I never got started online because there's just too much stuff on [VA sites]

Applied for benefits in the 80s with a paper form with some guidance from the vocational resources at the school she applied to after leaving service.

* Didn't notice an error after skipping a required field

## #5

School helped with applying for benefits with their Vet support programs. It was a paper form with a few pages, and then something quick to renew each year.
 * Jumped right into applying, skipping explanatory text 
 
> If I wanted to apply, I know there's this website for veterans .. scratch that. I'd go down to Hopkins Plaza (Benefits Office)
> This doesn't spook me. This would have been nice. I hope they go with it.
> The other VA sites you either find what you need, or not.. and if you end up in an FAQ somewhere forget it.

Applied with a VR&E specialist on a paper form.  Has helped a few friends apply, but points them to VA Facilities like Hopkins Plaza because she felt eBenefits was unreliable.

 * Asked for an estimate because she wouldn't be able to save
 * Used the 'required field' marker as a tooltip on 'National Call to Service'
