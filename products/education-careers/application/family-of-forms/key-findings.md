# Key findings | family of forms flow research

## Design
- Clean design had people moving quickly through the identity framing screens.
- Clean design built trust for some Veterans who don't trust existing digital forms.

## Language
- National Call to Service was confusing and seemed to be interpretted as alternate terminology for Selective Service
- Certificate of Eligibility was mentioned twice as common language around Home Loans. This might not be the best way to frame it, though we did move that direction based on previous testing.
- Guidance in the instruction section was important, though our random break point on the screen happened to make it feel like it was a fixed page for some people.
- The warning about not being able to save caused anxiety
 - There was interest in referencing the instructions again once the application began.
 - If it can't be saved, how long will it be? How long should I expect it to take?
 - Two people asked if there was a way to check the school's reputation/success rate.

## Personal guidance
- All of our interviewees had been coached or guided by someone, either the VBA office or VA office at their school.
- Some expressed avoiding digital applications because they are less reliable. They prefer to go in person, fill out a paper and hand it to someone.
 
## Form numbers
- No one noticed or commented on the Form Numbers in the header.
- No comments about form numbers on intro-apply page.
- Only one person felt confident that they knew the form number at the time of application. Others felt like they were just filling out whatever was handed to them.

## Security
- Full SS# instead of last for was IDed as potentially causing concern for some people.
- At least one questions about privacy policies
- Not needing to login was comforting

# Gaps in research

- Hard to find people with recent intimate experience with applying for education benefits
  - Medical facilities skew to an older population
  - Work with VA offices at local universities?
  - Student Veterans of America?
- Voc Rehab seems like a much more commonly used resource
- Some of the more complicated paths in our test are also not very common or are not as Veteran-centric which makes it harder to test.

## Extra notes on Voc Rehab
- If you are eligible for Voc Rehab and GI Bill Education Benefits... 
  - You can't use both
  - Voc rehab will likely give you much more financial flexibility
