# Family of Education Forms

- [All fields comparison spreadsheet](all-forms-field-comparison.xlsx)  
  A spreadsheet of all the form fields we’ve found in discovery. It’s useful in coordinating copy across multiple forms. Wherever possible, we want to ask the same question the same way on all forms.

  In addition to asking questions the same way, we also want to organize the forms similarly. This diagram shows how they get grouped into chapters across the Education forms
- [Form relationship diagram](form-relationships.png)  
  The Education benefit application forms have initially confusing overlapping audiences. This diagram explains the relationships. [Sketch source file](family-of-forms-diagram.sketch)
- [Form usage stats]()  
  We did these forms in order of current usage. These are the stats we based that decision on.

## Multi-form
Having six forms in one benefit area is unusual on vets.gov. Initially we just wanted to avoid needing six call-to-action buttons on the page. But as discovery progressed we found that applicants are sometimes confused about which form they should be using. Even when they are looking for a specific form number, it may not be the one best suited for their situation. The multi-form approach asks a few questions to help applicants find (or confirm) that they are on the correct path.
