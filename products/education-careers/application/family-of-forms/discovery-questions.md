_Master list of questions, mostly pulled from review of the family of forms. Questions specific to 1995 and subsequent forms can be pulled out and addressed in an issue._

# General discovery questions

- When were each of these forms last updated?
- Is your team in charge of maintaining these forms?
- Are there additional people that we didn't meet through the 1990 process that we should include? (National Call to Service, teams that support dependents and spouse)
- Are there other education benefits forms that Veterans might use?
- Why are these the ones that were made into webforms?
- What questions on these forms are only relevant to SOME types of applicants?
- Why is the NCS application generally so much simpler?


# Field level questions for family of forms

Gender, Date of Birth

- Can we remove these for the 5495 and 1995 since it is not used to determine benefits and should already be on record?

File number

- Do file numbers have letters in them?

If during the review made by VA I am found eligible for more than one benefit, I authorize VA to pay the benefit with the highest monthly rate. (Only 1990N)

- Is this a variant of Q14 from the 1990? If so, can we remove here if we cover it in a similar way to the 1990 elswhere?

I choose to give up

- We don't ask this question for 1990N. Is it because they are only ever eligible for one type of benefit?
- Can spouse or dependents ever be eligible for more than one benefit? Are they ever required to give up a benefit in order to receive the one they are applying for?
- If a veteran is applying under someone else's benefit, do they have to give up anything that they are eligible under their own benefit?

What is your relationship to the Servicemember whose benefit is being transferred to you?

- 1990E - this is not used to trigger any additional questions. Can we remove it?
- 5490 - this is used to trigger questions about divorce, annulment and remarriage. Should this also apply to 1990E? Or can we remove?
- 5495 - The relationship of the Veteran who's benefits you are using should have been established in the original form (5490). Can we remove?

Is there a divorce or annulment pending to the qualifying individual?

- Why is this question only asked on one of the two Spouse application forms? (I might know…because the 1990E requires a consenting transfer.)

If you are the surviving spouse, have you remarried?

- Why is this question only asked on one of the two Spouse application forms? (I might know…because the 1990E requires a consenting transfer.)

Sponsor Veteran's: first, middle, last, suffix, SSN, DOB, branch of service

- Can we remove? This data should not have changed since the original submission of the 5490.

Is the qualifying individual on active duty?

- Can we remove? Why is current active duty relevant only for the benefit that is for dependents of deceased, permanently disabled or MIA or POW? Seems like you could infer Active duty from the MIA or POW date or from their being deceased or permanently disabled.

Type of service (Active duty, drilling reservist, IRR, etc.)

- Some of the forms request military service. Others only ask for periods of duty. We refer to Service Periods and ask for a type of service. Is this accurate? Are we asking Veterans for more information than we need?
  We think non-active duty is relevant for Reservists, but if that's the case should we also be asking for it that way on all forms?

Type of separation or discharge

- Remove? Why do we only ask this question on the 5490, 5495 and 1995?

If this active duty is National Guard duty, indicate if authority is title 10 (Federal) or title 32 (state)

- Outlier. Can we remove? (Only on 1995.)

If you received a commission from a military service academy, what year did you graduate?

- We only ask this on the 1990. Is it relevant to others or can we remove it from the 1990?

Are you on active duty now?

- Does current active duty apply if a veteran is applying under someone else’s benefit?

Are you on terminal leave now?

- If Active Duty matters on the 1995, then does the follow up about terminal leave also matter?

Were you commissioned as a result of senior ROTC?

- Confirm that this is only relevant to 1990. (Currently it does not appear on any other form.)

What is the source of these funds?

- This is only asked on the 1990N and the 5490. Can we remove?

I made contributions (up to $600) to increase the amount of my monthly benefits.

- Confirm that this is not relevant to any form other than the 1990.

I qualify for an Active Duty Kicker (sometimes called a college fund).

- Confirm that this is not relevant to any form other than the 1990.

I qualify for a Reserve Kicker (sometimes called a college fund).

- Confirm that this is not relevant to any form other than the 1990.

I have a period of service that the Department of Defense counts toward an education loan payment.

- Confirm that this is not relevant to any form other than the 1990.

What is your current high school status?

- This is only asked for the 5490. Is there a reason it is only relevant on that and not the 1990E? Can we remove?

Name of high school (ALL school details as well)

- Do we truly need all high school details for only the 5490? If so, does everyone need to enter it?

Employer

- We only ask for the name of the employer on the 5490. Can we remove?

What is the name of the program you're requesting?

- We are only asking this on the 5495 and 1995. Since we don't ask it on the original application forms, it doesn't seem necessary here. Can we remove?

Secondary contact

- We are only asking this for the 1990 and 5490. Should we ask this for all forms? Or at least all original Apply forms?
