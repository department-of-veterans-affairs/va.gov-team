# Family of Education Benefit Forms
We briefly thought that we might be able to roll the 22-1990E and 22-1990N forms into the 22-1990 form redesign.

In short, even though the 1990 forms are all similar, they aren't the only forms involved in the real-world process.

- **22-1990**
  Veteran applying for benefits under their own service
- **22-1990N**  
  Veteran applying under the National Call to Service.
- **22-1990E**  
  Dependents apply to use the benefits of a sponsor servicemember who has elected to transfer them to said dependent. Sponsor needs to have elected the transfer using TEB site while still in the military.
- **22-5490**  
  Dependent applies for educational transfer of benefits from a deceased or totally disabled servicemember.
- **22-5495**  
  Dependent is changing the school or training where they are using their (5490) benefit.
- **22-1995**  Veteran is changing school or training where they are using their benefit. Or dependent is changing schools using benefit through TOE.

Just adding the 1990E variant only partially addresses the dependents. **We may actually want to tackle the 22-1995** (move benefit to new school) **before the others.** To close down VONAPP weâ€™ll need to cover the remaining education benefit forms (plus pension and burial).
