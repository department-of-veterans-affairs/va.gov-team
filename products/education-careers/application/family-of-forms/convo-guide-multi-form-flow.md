## Conversation Guide

### The pitch

- Hey, do you have a few minutes?
- We're working with the VA to help improve services.
- _Today we're looking at education stuff...etc._
- Would you help us test part of the website we're working on?
- This should only take 10-15 minutes.

### General questions

- Have you ever applied for Education Benefits?
  - Do you know if your service makes you eligible for Education Benefits?
- How would you expect to find the form they're looking for?
- Which benefits did you apply for?
- Did you talk to anyone during the process?
- Did you have to read anything during the process?
- How did you figure out what to do?
- How do you know which form to use?
  - Once you figured out which form to use, how easy or difficult was it to apply for edu benefits?
- Have you ever helped a Veteran apply for education benefits?
  - Were you working for the VA or as a VSO when you helped them?
  - What does that look like?
  - How do you determine which form to advise a Veteran to use?

### Show prototype

- Could you try this out as though you were trying to get those benefits today?

_Go through whole application (~6 actions), ask them to talk through what they're thinking with each question._

- How did that process seem?
