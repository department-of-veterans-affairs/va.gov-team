# Initial questions (Observations)

- What amount of inconsistency between forms is a difference in policy vs form created on a different day?
  - e.g Asking how many years your program was vs how many credit hours and what type of credit hours
  - e.g. Asking for HS graduation year vs asking for full details on where/when/how long?
- For the most part, if we made decisions about removing specific things from the 1990 that were in VONAPP only, can we make the same decision for the rest of the forms?

## Specific to 22-1995
_Veteran is changing school or training where they are using their benefit._

- Why aren't we asking for date of birth (DOB) on the 1995?
- Is file number useful? What database is it generate by? Is SS # sufficient?
- Paper form asks for SS of veteran for transferability. Why? Who uses this form that way?
- Why does it matter if someone is changing their educational, professional or vocational goal?
- Are there particular parts of the form that are important to each of these types of applicants?
  - you're changing schools,
  - you're changing your educational, professional, vocational goal,
  - you left your program due to unsatisfactory attendance, progress, or conduct; and you're now reentering the same program, or
  - you were receiving VA education benefits as a veteran and now wish to receive benefits while on active military duty.
    - Is active duty the only thing that matters?
- Which of the above users is the most common?
- Why is the benefit question on the paper form and not VONAPP?
- Are veterans supposed to select the benefit they are currently receiving?
- Why would someone be using this form for the Transfer of Entitlement Program?
  - Can someone be using their own benefits and their benefits as a dependent at the same time?
- What does this mean?: "What's the name of the program you're requesting?"
- Generally why is military history needed at this stage?
- Why does the 1995 only ask for Active Duty military service history, but then ask for service status? (Including Active Duty)
- Why does the 1995 care about character of discharge and the 1990 didn't.
- Why does the 1995 care about National Guard Title # and the 1990 didn't.
- Specificity around dependent information is greater on the 1995 than the 1990. Why?
- Work/Daytime/Evening phone. Ok as primary/secondary?
- 'Receiving benefits from government as a civilian employee' question prompts alert that you will not be eligible, but lets you continue.
- Why does Title 10/32 matter for National Guard in 1995 but not in 1990?
- ROTC doesn't matter
- Kicker questions don't matter
- Is document upload any more important for this application (National guard question)
