# Product Outline for Education Benefit Application Updates

---

## Overview
Several applications for education benefits are being updated to conform to [Isakson-Roe legislation](https://benefits.va.gov/gibill/isaksonroe.asp) expanding benefits and to better map with their paper-form counterparts.   

## Problem Statement
Several education benefit application forms are now out of date due to the newly passed legislation & updates to the paper forms.   

How might we update the forms to be compliant with legislation and align with the print versions of the forms?
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Users will have the latest information on their benefits, which are expanded under the new legislation.

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Users have confusion about the differences in the forms

## Desired Business Outcomes

- Business is in compliance with federal laws.

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- Business has to handle confusion users may have with updated content. 

---
## Measuring Success

* Users will continue to submit each form at the current rate -- or even increased rates. 

---

## Assumptions
- Form updates are focused on the legislative changes and select business requests only.  
- No additional "improvements" have been made to the forms such as retro-fitting of new design components, extensive QA / accessibility testing on original functionality.
