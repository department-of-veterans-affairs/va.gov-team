# 5495 & 1990N usability feedback sessions

## Goals

- Check for usability problems that need to be corrected before launch
- Find opportunities for follow on work

## Summary

- Confirmation page could be more reassuring
  - Can I print this out for reference?
  - Could I get an email confirmation?
- Some questions weren't clearly relevant
- Direct deposit is more clear with a label

## What worked well

- Overall very clear and easy to use
  - "Easy button…"
- "Seems shorter than I would expect..."
- "Forms seem usable by older folks" big type, etc.

## What didn't work well

- Sometimes applicant terminology doesn’t map directly to ours. 
  - For example, one applicant was looking for "technical school" in the program type dropdown
- Sometimes it's not clear why a question might be asked
  - For example, educational goal or felony question
  - Free text questions raised questions about how the answer would be used
- Examples are helpful in cases like the "are you receiving additional benefits question"

## Methods

- Remote usability feedback sessions where the participants remote operated the forms while we took notes
- Three participants

## Raw notes

### **Session 1: J.B.**

 4/26/2017

Heavy equipment mechanic, in Cali Missouri, 

- He had knee surgery
- Used the education benefit
- USMC  

#### 5495 

- he likes that you can enter SSN, comfortable w/last 4 digits 
- "most would be for the college to fill out” 
- "his sister used his dad’s GI Bill and everything was filled out for her” 
- The best thing to do is to get all the school info first and contact the VA first 
- He would bring the question to a recruiter regarding knowing his 'sponsors SSN’ 
- **“Last question about felony shouldn’t matter”** 
- want to know what is on the application and he wouldn’t answer 
- It would be good to have the info on who to contact 
- the school selection page is “pretty standard” 
- **Was looking for the words "technical school". He would enter the vocational school 1st then the most current attended school** 
- The benefit payment page, "pretty self-explanatory" 
- The review application page, "pretty standard, it breaks it down" 
- The claims received page, "seems alright"  
- Preferred contact method "email or phone is the quickest way to contact him"

### 1990N

Ran out of time for 1990N

## Session 2: **J.T.**

4/26/2017

- 3 years in the army, 


- Currently using the Post 911 GI Bill for his education 
- Applied through VONAPP for his education benefit 

### **5495 Form**

- He typically reads the headings and skims through the rest 
- “as far as what to expect, it tells you to apply for the benefits, the VA is going to review it, and they will notify me in 30 days on their decision, to me it’s pretty straight forward” “I wouldn’t have any questions at that point" 
- He couldn't tab over to the ‘Day’ in the Date of birth section of the application  
- He likes how it tells you how far you within the application (status bar) 
- Having the dashes for the SSN already pop up as you are entering your SSN number (he feels like the error message is requiring him to entering in the dashes but he realizes he just didn’t enter in enough digits 
- He asks if he should fill out all or the require info. When asked is it clear to you what is required and what’s not? he stated that the red lettering helps  
- He skipped past the direct deposit page because he didn’t see a ‘required’ label,  
  - ‘When he saw that it said, 'personal information’, he actually didn’t know that it had anything to do with direct deposit 
- **“Normally, there is some type of Print verification, something he can go back to later to reference, like a date or application letter stating that he had applied”** 
- **The confirmation number under the Education Benefit Claim was not that apparent to him initially. He didn’t think he would find the confirmation number under the Edu. Benefit claim expanded box.**  
- He went back to being able to print the page 

#### Points that are confusing: 

- **error message for SSN was a little unclear** 
- tabbing when entering in DOB slows down the process (didn’t act like most appellations online) 
- When entering the address, he entered in Maine but switched to Kansas.  This is because he mistaken hit ‘M at first then he tried to hit ‘K’ but it didn’t work so he ended up using the drop-down menu 

#### Worked well: 

- “Like how short each page was, it was a lot of info to enter in before clicking to the next page 


- the status bar to show you how far you are in the application 
- **“Seems easier to enter when its small bits of info”** 

#### Magic Wand: 

- **A clearer error message** 
- A submission receipt with the confirmation number. He would want to see a little blue box to print out the confirmation with the date and confirmation # 

### 1990N

- “About the same as the other one in what to expect, pretty straight forward” 

*Technical problems entering text due to GTM screen sharing* 

- could tab through the application when Alex was entering in the data for the participant 
- If it’s not required, he probably won’t enter the extra info, b/c it takes too much time and he doesn’t like to put too much info on the internet 
- Nothing was surprising on this form, anything VA would want to know your branch and service period 
- He wonders why the end of the service period isn’t required.  
- The active duty question he didn’t pay attention to b/c it’s not required, he says the print is small, “it seems like fine print” 
- He didn’t expect the active duty question would drop down to more questions, but since it dropped down to more questions, it made him read them 
- Page Two Benefit Selection, it makes it almost seem like the ending, it almost looks like an error message or that he did something wrong. (The size of it at first glance) 
- He thinks the school information would be required 
- He thinks applicant address should come right after his DOB or something. It surprised him that this personal information would come so late in the application  
  - ‘It would make him wonder, if it was something that he clicked that would prompt to needing more info” He would think that he had already entered his personal info but would go back and see he didn’t 
- Direct deposit page: “The other form was like this, I like this better” He likes that it shows exactly where to send the money 
- Again, he would expect there would be an area to print page, “some VA forms he wonders how older people would feel them out” 

#### Points of confusion

- Not knowing when they he will be contacted by the VA when applying for compensation for an injury that is service connected 
- There wasn’t much that was confusing but he would like documentation, something tangible in his hand, an easier way to print. 

#### Things that worked well

- **The letters are pretty big and the boxes are big.** 
- He like the Direct deposit a lot better. 
- **Seems pretty easy and straight forward to use.**



## Session 3: M.C.

- Retired Army 2016
- Kids using education benefits
- Counselor has been walking me through switching from one EDU benefit to the other
- Have also used health benefits
- Very familiar with benefits

**Would be interested in helping recruit**

### 5495

- Notes that application can't be saved
- SSN validation tripped him up, but likely just because of sequential number 
- Is familiar with vets.gov
  - Seems straight-forward
- Noted advice to gather records, from intro page
- Mentions that 18yo might not have as much context or knowledge of the benefits
- Question about future dates but was thinking about another application "disregard that"
- Filled in optional contact details too
- At review page, confused about whether applying or modifying. Misremembered instructions
- Is it going to email me a confirmation?
  - "I would really like to get an email confirmation"

#### Points of confusion

- Pretty straightforward!
- Some kind of confirmation would make me feel better
  - I called in about DEA and they said call in 7-10 days because the system isn't working quite right

#### Magic Wand

- Email confirmation
- **Don't really have any complaints. "I think this is pretty simple to use as a user"**
- **Save as we go along.** **GET QUOTE CLIP**



#### Easy to use

- Questions may have been revised?
  - I didn't feel like I got asked lots of extra questions, it was easy **GET QUOTE CLIP**

### 1990N

- Maybe some suggestions for typical sources (in additional benefits)
  - Maybe a tooltip of some sort?
- Curious about the "VA picks highest monthly rate" checkbox. Are there reasons that I might want to override the VA pick?
  - Better benefit for your specific situation?
- **Does my education goal matter?**
  - Is this relevant?
- **Free text makes me wonder if this question matters?**

#### Points of confusion

Same as above

- Additional benefits could use some examples

#### Magic wand

Same as before

- Print out the form, or my answers. Ability to capture submission. Feels more secure.
  - Prompt would you like to print?

#### What’s good?

Easy button **GET QUOTE CLIP**
