### Welcome and Opening Remarks (5 minutes)
*[When the participant is ready, the moderator will begin the session with the following introduction.]*

Thank you for joining us today. My name is [NAME] and we also have [NAME OF OTHERS OBSERVING] observing and taking notes for this session. We are doing this website feedback session on behalf of the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs working to build a new website that will help veterans get easier access to the benefits they deserve.

We’re working on a new version of an Education Benefits form and we’d like to see how it works for real people.

Before we begin, I’d like to make a few things clear and explain how the session will work.

  * We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.
  * We aren’t testing your ability. We’re just trying to figure out what works well on the website, and what doesn’t work well. So there are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions and what you think so that we can make the site better. I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.
  * This entire feedback session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question or task.
  * We’ll be recording the screen activities as we look at the site. Recording our discussion today will help us capture everything you say accurately.
  * If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

In this session, we’d like you to show you a prototype of a form for transferring benefits to a new school and just talk us through your impressions as you go. Please think out loud as you are moving through the form.

### Main questions

- Can you tell me a little about yourself?
- Could you tell me about what VA education benefits you have used?
  - Have you had to move your benefit to a new school?
- Could you try out a form for moving an Education Benefit from one school to another?

[Use screen-share to let them fill out the 22-5495 running on staging](https://staging.vets.gov/education/apply-for-education-benefits/application/5495/introduction)

```
1. Please imagine that you are changing to a new program at another school.
2. Please imagine that you have interrupted your schooling to serve another tour of duty. When you returned from your service, you decided to change majors and attend a new school.
```

- What parts of the process seemed confusing or required extra work?
- If you could wave a magic wand and improve three things in the application process, what would they be? What would the magically improved version be like?
- What are the easiest parts of the process that should be kept as-is?
