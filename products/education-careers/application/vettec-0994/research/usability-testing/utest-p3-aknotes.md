VET TEC Usability Testing 
Feb. 6, 10am. Jared

Background: 
-	Edu benefits = yes.
-	Really smooth, surprisingly.
-	Has used VA.gov

Observations…
Generally there are some challenges with the WebEx share control which make this a little hard for the user to interact with the prototype. 

Scenario 1. 
-	Reads the instructions! 
-	When he’s done with instructions, he scrolls back to the top to click the apply button. 
-	Is aware of 1990 and knows that he has submitted 1990.
-	RE: Have you selected a program… “Hopefully I’d done some research before I got to this form.”
-	RE Personal Information - Likes that “everything is pre-loaded”
-	RE: Review the application: Like that I don’t have to go back into the application to check my answers. 

General Thoughts
-	Very simple, which is great. 
-	I like the fact that … everything is “click” and “apply”
* I like the review page where you can see all the info you’ve entered. 
  * What happens if I edit on this page? I’d expect it to take me back to this page but it would be really easy to have it load on this page. 

Thoughts on intro content?
-	Very simple.  Tells you everything you need at the beginning so I can prepare what I need. 
* Helpful to have a link or a redirect to the 1990 so I don’t have to go to Google and find a 1990 to fill in.
  * UPDATE INTRO CONTENT – say that you can fill out the 1990 in this same setting. 

Any thoughts on how you’d learn about this program?  
VA Education Benefits Website. Assuming there’s a VA App, where it would be listed. It should also be included in TAPS program.
