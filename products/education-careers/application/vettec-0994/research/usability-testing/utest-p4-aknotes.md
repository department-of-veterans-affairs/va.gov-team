VET TEC Usability Testing 
Feb. 6, 12pm. Aiku

Background: 
-	Edu benefits = yes.

Observations…
Maybe she is outside, it sounds like there’s a marching band behind her.  Or someone banging on drums. 
Also, the mouse is really jumpy. And that weird “ghost screen” thing happened. 

Scenario 1. 
* Would read everything to figure out what I needed.  Sometimes forms are older or newer
  * What’s the difference between the older or newer forms? If I apply for education benefits, a date or something will show that it’s a newer one. 
* When she’s done with instructions, scrolls back to the top to click the START button. 
* Seems like a standard VA application – questions / answers.  Like that the “finish the application later” button is right there.
* Seems really straight-forward. 
* On Personal Info / Address Update… “I don’t know exactly what would be VA records. Is it all of them? That would be nice?”
  * Recommendation on Personal Info / Address Update: Be more specific about what’s included in “VA records” 

General Thoughts
* Easy. Self explanatory.  Very straight-forward.  Easy to follow and fill out.  
* Updating the information across all VA Records: It would be really convenient – especially since there are so many systems out there.  
* Wonders if there’s more information on the program.
