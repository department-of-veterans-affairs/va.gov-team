## Conversation Guide – VET TEC Application Form<br/>
January 2019<br/>

### Intro - 2 minutes (until :2 in)


Thanks for joining us today! My name is [name], and I also have two colleagues on the line, ___ and ___. They are observing and taking notes. 

We work with a team at the VA that is developing a website called VA.gov, and we're interested in speaking with you today about a new form the team is designing.  


The VA is developing a pilot program called VET TEC.  The goal of the program is to provide eligible Veterans with the opportunity to enroll in high-tech education programs. The program is designed to provide Veterans with training and skills that prepare them for jobs in the high-tech industry.


We’d like your thoughts on what aspects of the new application form work well and where we might make improvements to make things even easier for Veterans.


Before we start, I’d like to mention a few logistical details:


The entire session should take about 30 minutes.


•	We are interested in hearing your honest opinions. We are in no way testing your knowledge or ability. We just want to hear your ideas and be sure the application we are designing will meet Veterans’ needs. You are welcome to express any opinions you wish. We welcome your feedback.

•	If for any reason you want to pause or stop the session at any time, please let me know. Your participation is completely voluntary. 

•	By testing the form thoroughly, we hope to ensure that it’s written in a thoughtful way and helps Veterans understand exactly what information they need to provide.

•	Do you have any questions so far?

•	Lastly, we generally record sessions, in case we need to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today? 


Great! I'm going to turn on screen and audio recording now.  When we hear an announcement that it’s started, I’ll ask again if you are okay if we record the audio so we have your verbal consent.


[The meeting host will begin audio and screen recording.]


Are you comfortable if I record the audio today?


### Background Questions - 3 minutes (until :5 in)


1.	First, let's discuss your experience of filing for educational benefits.


•	Have you filed for educational benefits in the past? 

>**Yes.**

•	If yes, approximately how long ago did you file for educational benefits?

•	What do you remember about the process of filing for education benefits? 


>**It was online, for the GI Bill and I changed universities before I started so I kind of had to do it twice. It was pretty easy, it was just the processing time that there was a little hiccup.** 


(If needed) I'm sorry your prior experience was so burdensome. Our team’s goal is to streamline the online application process. I’ll pass the information I learn on today’s call along to the designer, so they can make the necessary adjustments. <br/>

2.	How comfortable are you with technology and using websites?

3.	Have you ever used VA.gov before?


>**Yes, I have.**


VA.gov is being developed to unify and simplify Veterans' digital interactions with the VA.

 
### Transition to scenarios - 2 minutes (until :7 in)


Now we're going to shift gears and walk through a few scenarios.  


Just so you know, the prototype that we’ll be reviewing today is a mock-up, rather than a real website.  


Let’s take a look at one of the pages, so I can point out a couple of things that you’ll notice as you click through the prototype.


•	Only certain links have been activated.  
Because we are only testing the form itself, links in the header and in the footer of the page are not active. 

•	You’ll not need to enter any data.  
For example, if you see an address field, you can just click it as if you were going to enter one, however a ficticious address will automatically appear.  This protects you from entering personal information and saves time during the testing process.


Now I'll give you keyboard and mouse control, so we can both interact with the prototype.


<Have them “try it now”.>


Think Aloud
While you are going through the site, we ask that you Please think aloud and vocalize your thoughts, and decisions as you see each page. We are interested in your first reaction to each page.  


For example, if you say something like, “I’m looking for a login button” we’ll know that you are not able to find the specific thing you’re looking for on the page. 


The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn.  If you have questions about what information needs to go in a particular field, it’s likely that many other Veterans will too. This may seem strange at first, but it helps us understand what you are thinking and helps us so much with our work.


### First Scenario: VA Form 22-0994 Completion 


15 minutes (until :22 in)


#### Scenario 1 
Let’s assume you are a Veteran who is interested in transitioning into the high-tech industry.  You have a little experience with Data Processing, but lately you’ve been working in sales. You’ve done a bit of research and found 2 programs that you are interested in.  Let’s assume you’ve already logged into vets.gov. Starting from the current page, and would like to apply for the VET TEC program?  
As I mentioned before, please think aloud as you go through the screens. 


### Steps


[The Steps below are for information only and are not read aloud to the participant.  Debrief questions are included if there is time.]


#### •	Intro

  o	Click “Start the VET TEC Application >>”

  What questions do you have about the process?


>**I guess I see where we start. I would scroll down a little bit first to see what’s going to be involved. So this is good info here. Like knowing what I need. If I didn’t scroll down, I thought there would be a prompt, maybe something that noticed that I can start and come back to this application at any time. And then something under the va site, under apply. So sometimes I’m not sure when I’ve used the application button at the top if it’s the same thing as completing the form. Since the process is 30 days, it’s just something I’d want to know.**


#### •	Step 1 of 8 Application Information

o	Click Continue

What would you do if you noticed that your DOB, SSN or Gender needed to be updated?

Would you expect to be able to update them on this page?


#### •	Step 2 of 8 Benefits Eligibility

In No, do you have any questions about completing VA Form 22-1990?

What would happen if you haven’t already filled out VA Form 22-1990?

How do you feel about transitioning directly to the VA Form 22-1990 after the VA Form 0994?


#### •	Step 3 of 8 Military History

What did you think of the process of entering programs? 

Where would you expect to find information about programs?


>**I like that it says it’s been saved or I can finish it later, too.**


#### •	Step 7 of 8 Personal Information

o	[Optional] Click Edit Phone & email, Click Done

o	[Optional] Click Edit Mailing address, Click Done

o	Click Continue

Do you think that updating your information here will update your information through the VA?


#### •	Step 7 of 8 Direct Deposit Information

o	Enter Account Type of Checking

o	Enter Routing Number

o	Enter Account Number

o	Click Save 

o	Click “What if I don’t have a bank account?”

o	Click Continue

Do you think that updating your information here will update your information through the VA?

What would you do if you do not have a bank account?


>**I’d probably spend a lot more time on this page than I would on the other verifying my info. I like the security feature, but I’d actually like to make sure, see my whole account. Optional mask.**

>**[new account button] I guess I would expect to see account number, routing, institution. I would hope it doesn’t take me to another page and have to leave this. Have a button to do a quick check to make sure it matches up. I wouldn’t mind putting in things twice, like when you verify putting in your email address.**


#### •	Step 8 of 8 Review Application

o	Click checkbox

o	Click Submit Application


>**So I like this that it doesn’t populate a huge page. I like looking at things individually. It would be nice to have a notification, like a flag, like if I put work experience, is it consistent with my VA profile. Are you sure? Otherwise I do like that you can just open and close each of these.**
 
>**And then just maybe it might be easier for other vets instead of leaving this field as true, having one value. This says true, and the others could say no, I didn’t check that.**

>**I like this a lot, even just the small things, like the white spacing between the two.** 

>**I do like the ability to edit right here.** 


#### •	Confirmation Page (If added)

o	What do you expect the next steps are?


#### Things to watch for:

•	Where do users have questions?

•	How do users react to the content and functionality?

•	Does the application process seem intuitive and natural to them?

•	Do they access help text to view additional content?

•	Do they anticipate they’d be applying for the benefit if they weren’t eligible?

•	Do they expect the benefit to apply to taking a regular college course?

•	Are they interested in the VET TEC program?


### Post-Task Interview - 5 minute (until :42 in)
Now that you’ve had a chance to explore the prototype, what questions or comments do you have about the various pages you’ve seen?


What are your thoughts on the overall process? 


>**I like this. Sometimes you have to jump through hoops, sometimes it’s a 2 hour application. This is more straightforward. It didn’t take very long at all. ** 

>**I know a lot of parts of the VA don’t talk to each other. Education doesn’t talk to other benefits (?). ** 

>**Would you expect your address here to update your VA address? I wouldn’t expect it to update VA records if I typed in an address here, but I would like it if it would.** 

>**Likes: progress tracker, step 7 of 7.**

>**An email confirmation is always nice to know that it went through or if it could generate a confirmation number. **

>**What did you think of the process of entering your programs in? It’s nice not to look up like the zip code for it. I also like that I didn’t have to type it in, and it wasn’t making me pick from a populated list.** 

>**Intro page: what I usually do, if there’s a program I’m interested in, I’ll look for it on the VA site, and I’ll read about it there. Usually for me, I know enough about the program, and the things I’m looking for on that site. I don’t usually read too much of the program info on the link to apply, if that makes sense. There’s a link on here that says “learn more about the programs” I like that. If I’m still researching that, I’m not going to hit the green button. I would research what I need. ** 


Looks like we have a few minutes left, so I want to pause and give my colleagues on the phone an opportunity to ask any questions they may have.


[Additional questions from any observers on the phone]
Do you have any questions for us?


>**When is the program coming out? I want to apply. **
