#### Notes
* Mention that the benefit is only available to Veterans (in case someone lands on this form, without reading the program description and eligibility criteria that reside on the Education Services area on VA.gov).
* Display a "Find out if you are eligible" link 
* Have you applied for educational benefits in the past? Yes/No Will let us know if they have completed a 22-1990.
* Include the form name, as well as the number
* Include a note for National Guard and Reservist who may wonder if they are eligible.  Have the note be static, rather than be conditional upon their answer to a question.
* Want to be sure we avoid discouraging Veterans from applying.
* Some people identify as both Active Duty and Veteran, such as National guard
* Some do not have high school - so add some high school as an option.
* Define High-tech - is it only IT? What are the confines?
* Can the COE be used on any of the sites, any limitations?
* Ask what the best contact method is (some prefer email).
* Be attuned to security concerns
* Like masking functionality
* What if they do not want to give their bank account? Expand title of helper text to apply to those who do not have OR do not want to provide.

"This is awesome.  It's easy, it's very easy."
