VET TEC Usability Testing 
Feb. 6, 2pm. Eileen

Background: 
-	Edu benefits = yes. A lot of hoops to jump through.

Observations…
A little late to the session. Had to download Chrome to participate in the testing session. Rural Texas – using phone for personal hotspot. 
Wants to know if we have tested for visually impaired Veterans – has JAWS on typical computer. 
We are testing on staging!! There are bugs. 
"My main concern is for low-vision users." Contact Blind Veteran Association – they may give you individuals who can help with that. 

Scenario 1. 
*	I wouldn’t even read the other stuff, I’d just go to the green button and start. 
*	Discovered that the date isn’t navigable by tabbing in the initial “Program Selection” input
*	Wants to know “WHY” will info be updated on the VA records. 
  *	Gives example of why the addresses being updated would be challenging. 

General Thoughts
-	Overall, the format is good, color is decent and it’s not cluttered with crap. 
-	Veterans may have multiple addresses where they receive mail. 

OTHER NOTES –
