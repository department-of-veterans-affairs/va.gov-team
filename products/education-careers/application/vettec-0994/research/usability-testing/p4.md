#### Notes
* Wondered what was meant by all  VA record addresses being updated. It would be really convenient, especially as there are so many systems out there.
* The form is really straightforward, simple.  Easier that the old forms
* Like that you could add another program in the Review section.
* Liked the ability to call for help in the footer.
* Liked helper text on the direct dep page.
* The order of questions seems appropriate - ask for information is a way that makes sense
* Assumed she’d be able to read about programs on the main Education site.
