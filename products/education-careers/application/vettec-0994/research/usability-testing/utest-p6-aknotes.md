Feb. 6, 4pm. Robert

Background: 
-	Edu benefits = yes. Some snags because he changed schools in the middle of the process.
-	Has used VA.gov.

Observations…
We are testing on staging! 

Scenario 1. 
* I hope there would be an opportunity to come back to the application if I didn’t have all the info I needed to start with.  
* Sometimes on the VA site, I’m not sure “when I use the application button at the top” is the same thing as completing the form (VA Form 22-0994). 
* Like the “application has been saved” alert (Program Selection page)
* Would spend a lot more time on the Bank Information page than others to confirm that the info is right.  And it would be good to have an option to unmask the numbers. 
* If I entered another account, I’d hope it didn’t take me to a new page and I’d have to restart.  
* I wouldn’t mind having to put in info twice to confirm the data was correct. 
* Review the Application
  * Accordions – I like that this doesn’t populate a huge page so I’m more likely to go through all this.  
  * It would be good if there could be a flag if there was data that was different than what’s already in my VA record.
  * Would be helpful if the “Yes” answers displayed as “Yes” and not “True”
  * I like this (page format) a lot. Even things like the white space between the two [programs].  And the ability to edit right here.

General Thoughts
* I like it. I feel like that’s what it should be. 
* This is much more straight-forward and it didn’t take long at all. 

OTHER NOTES – 
* What about changing your address? I know a lot of parts of VA don’t talk to others. I’d like to be able to see the discrepancy (like this address is different from what we have on file for you).  I wouldn’t expect it to change everywhere but it would be nice if it did. 
* I really like the visibility and the layout. 
* I like the blue chalkmark thing so you know how far you are  And steps 7 of 7.
* An email confirmation is always nice – or a confirmation number – so I can follow-up if I need. 
* I liked the process of putting in info for the program because I didn’t have to put a lot of information.  I liked that I could just put it in and I didn’t have to pick from a list. 
* Usually when I start the application, I know enough about the program that I know what I’m getting into.
