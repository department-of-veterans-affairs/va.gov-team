VET TEC Usability Testing 
Feb. 5, 2pm. 

Background: 
-	Edu benefits = yes.
-	Ebenefits is always down when she tries to log-in. 
-	Filed paper form via USPS.
-	Comfortable with technology. 


Scenario 1. 

*	Starting application right away, without reading the instructions. 
   - REC	Move the button down.

* Called to Active Duty: 
  * Might be helpful to address different scenarios or letting people know what falls into that category. 

-	“I like that the HELP phone number appears at the bottom of every single page.”

-	Will [the form] save as you go along? Yes? “That’s nice.”

-	Will there be a drop-down to select certain ones? It would be easier if there was a drop-down but there might be too many programs for that to be realistic. 

-	It’s also nice that the changes you make on this form will be throughout VA records.  I’ve had some challenges with that in the past. 

* Review Application screen: (opens / closes accordions)  
  * “I’m curious what falls under each of the categories.”  
  * “I like that on each of these fields you can go back and edit if you need to.” 

* Overall process
  * I thought it was good.  Easy to navigate. 
  * If there are changes after you submit, how do you make changes to this application? 

* Changes to banking info…
  * Assume it would be just this program BUT… address info is for everything so maybe bank info is, too. 
  * I haven’t had much luck with the VA changing my info
