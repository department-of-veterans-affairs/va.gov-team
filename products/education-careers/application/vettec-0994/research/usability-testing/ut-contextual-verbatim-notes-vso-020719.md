## Conversation Guide – VET TEC Application Form<br/>
January 2019<br/>

### Intro - 2 minutes (until :2 in)


Thanks for joining us today! My name is [name], and I also have two colleagues on the line, ___ and ___. They are observing and taking notes. 

We work with a team at the VA that is developing a website called VA.gov, and we're interested in speaking with you today about a new form the team is designing.  


The VA is developing a pilot program called VET TEC.  The goal of the program is to provide eligible Veterans with the opportunity to enroll in high-tech education programs. The program is designed to provide Veterans with training and skills that prepare them for jobs in the high-tech industry.


We’d like your thoughts on what aspects of the new application form work well and where we might make improvements to make things even easier for Veterans.


Before we start, I’d like to mention a few logistical details:


The entire session should take about 30 minutes.


•	We are interested in hearing your honest opinions. We are in no way testing your knowledge or ability. We just want to hear your ideas and be sure the application we are designing will meet Veterans’ needs. You are welcome to express any opinions you wish. We welcome your feedback.

•	If for any reason you want to pause or stop the session at any time, please let me know. Your participation is completely voluntary. 

•	By testing the form thoroughly, we hope to ensure that it’s written in a thoughtful way and helps Veterans understand exactly what information they need to provide.

•	Do you have any questions so far?

•	Lastly, we generally record sessions, in case we need to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today? 


Great! I'm going to turn on screen and audio recording now.  When we hear an announcement that it’s started, I’ll ask again if you are okay if we record the audio so we have your verbal consent.


[The meeting host will begin audio and screen recording.]


Are you comfortable if I record the audio today?


### Background Questions - 3 minutes (until :5 in)


1.	First, let's discuss your experience of filing for educational benefits.


•	Have you filed for educational benefits in the past? 

•	If yes, approximately how long ago did you file for educational benefits?

•	What do you remember about the process of filing for education benefits? 

(If needed) I'm sorry your prior experience was so burdensome. Our team’s goal is to streamline the online application process. I’ll pass the information I learn on today’s call along to the designer, so they can make the necessary adjustments. <br/>

2.	How comfortable are you with technology and using websites?

3.	Have you ever used VA.gov before?


VA.gov is being developed to unify and simplify Veterans' digital interactions with the VA.

 
### Transition to scenarios - 2 minutes (until :7 in)


Now we're going to shift gears and walk through a few scenarios.  


Just so you know, the prototype that we’ll be reviewing today is a mock-up, rather than a real website.  


Let’s take a look at one of the pages, so I can point out a couple of things that you’ll notice as you click through the prototype.


•	Only certain links have been activated.  
Because we are only testing the form itself, links in the header and in the footer of the page are not active. 

•	You’ll not need to enter any data.  
For example, if you see an address field, you can just click it as if you were going to enter one, however a ficticious address will automatically appear.  This protects you from entering personal information and saves time during the testing process.


Now I'll give you keyboard and mouse control, so we can both interact with the prototype.


<Have them “try it now”.>


Think Aloud
While you are going through the site, we ask that you Please think aloud and vocalize your thoughts, and decisions as you see each page. We are interested in your first reaction to each page.  


For example, if you say something like, “I’m looking for a login button” we’ll know that you are not able to find the specific thing you’re looking for on the page. 


The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn.  If you have questions about what information needs to go in a particular field, it’s likely that many other Veterans will too. This may seem strange at first, but it helps us understand what you are thinking and helps us so much with our work.


### First Scenario: VA Form 22-0994 Completion 


15 minutes (until :22 in)


#### Scenario 1 
Let’s assume you are a Veteran who is interested in transitioning into the high-tech industry.  You have a little experience with Data Processing, but lately you’ve been working in sales. You’ve done a bit of research and found 2 programs that you are interested in.  Let’s assume you’ve already logged into vets.gov. Starting from the current page, and would like to apply for the VET TEC program?  
As I mentioned before, please think aloud as you go through the screens.

>**You don’t want to discourage people from applying. I would say yes, the paragraph discourages people. “My eligibility is going to be called into question.”**

#### •	Step 4 of 8 Education History

>**We have a very small contingent ied(sp?) members, who don’t have a high school diploma. So I guess you’d need a high school diploma to qualify for this program?**

>**Is there a way to choose which way is best to contact them? I know that’s one of the things that the members tell us. Maybe their COE they’d rather get it over email than mail. If it is an option, there would be a lot of people that would take that.**

### Post-Task Interview - 5 minute (until :42 in)
Now that you’ve had a chance to explore the prototype, what questions or comments do you have about the various pages you’ve seen?


What are your thoughts on the overall process? 


>**It’s easier than the process that’s been in place for other education benefits. My concern is how they would get to the application, and not having to go through too many pages.** 


Looks like we have a few minutes left, so I want to pause and give my colleagues on the phone an opportunity to ask any questions they may have.


[Additional questions from any observers on the phone]
Do you have any questions for us?
