#### Demographics
Veteran, Male, White or Caucasian, 25 - 34, Master's degree, Navy, Virginia

#### Notes
* Familiar with the "what you'll need" section, that's the main content he's interested it.  Would already know enough about the program by the time he arrives on the intro page.
* Often not sure if the button above relates to the same form as "complete this form".
* Would scroll down and read information and double check info on review page.
* Likes that sections on review page are collapsible, so you can read one section at a time.
* Liked the progress bar and save and continue.
* Would prefer that his address be updated everywhere, but knows info is often not shared between VA departments. 
* Would like to have 2 fields to confirm bank account number.  Would not mind typing it twice to confirm that it is correct.
* Liked the security of masking and would like an option to un-mask the numbers.
* Would like to see a flag if the data he enters is inconsistent with his VA profile.
* Would like an email confirmation with a confirmation number
