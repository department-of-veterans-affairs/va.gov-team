* User stated that she would just click the green button to start.  She would not read the intro page, privacy policy, or review page.
* Mentioned that ”sites can be 508 compliant, but not accessible for low-vision users."
* Wondered if someone would help you fill out the form if you call the 800 #.
* Definitely does not want address to be updated across the VA. She has 4 addresses (Mailing-TX, Permanent-PO, Vacation, banking-MN).
* Veteran does not want banking information to update across the VA, as she wants education funds to go into a separate account from C&P funds.
