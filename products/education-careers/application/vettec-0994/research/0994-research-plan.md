# Sprint Research Plan #
## VA Form 22-0994 ##
January 7, 2018 – January 18, 2019

#### Problem Statement 
As a Veteran, I want to apply for VET TEC education benefits as easily as possible.  I would like to bypass any questions that are unrelated to my specific situation.

#### Solution Hypothesis
By presenting VA Form 22-0994 in an easy to use interview format, displaying only those questions that relate to the Veteran's specific situation, pre-populating data, presenting contextual help and guiding the Veteran through the process of completing the forms, Vets.gov will simplify the process of applying for education benefits. The online VA Form 22-0994 form will improve the experience of applying for educational benefits. It will save the Veteran time, increase their satisfaction with the process, and make them more confident in their ability to apply for benefits independently.

#### Research Questions

The research is designed to answer the following questions:
 
* What challenges or common pitfalls do Veterans face when attempting to apply for educational benefits?
* What information does the VA need to receive from Veterans on VA Form 22-0994 to ensure that valid requests for educational benefits are approved?
* Where can we use conditional logic and branching to display only those questions that are relevant to the Veteran?
* What information and/or contextual help would be helpful on VA Form 22-0994 to ensure valid requests are approved?

#### What knowledge will make us feel like the research process has been successful?

Learning about the issues Veterans encounter when completing the form will help us write instructional copy to help them complete the form correctly. 

In addition, learning the intent behind each question will allow us to write the application in a way that encourages accurate and thorough completion of the form, including non-required questions.    

#### What kinds of users do we need to talk to answer our questions?

The following users have been identified:
* Veterans
* VA Business Stakeholder / IPT Team Members
* College Veterans Office Representatives
* VSOs 

#### What specific questions do we need to ask on our Usability Testing screener to get the right kinds of users to test the form?

In addition to the standard questions, which ensure a representative mix of participants, the screener should include the following questions and responses:
1.	Have you applied for VA educational benefits before? 
   * If yes, to Question 3
   * If no, to Question 2
2.	Are you interested in applying for VA educational benefits?
   * If yes, to Question 4
   * If no, end
3.	Do you have any VA educational benefits remaining? 
   * If yes, to Question 4
   * If no, end
4.	Are you interested in pursuing education in the high-tech industry? 
   * If high-tech, to Question 5
   * If other, determine applicability before Question 5
5.	What is your age range?  
   * If 22-45 years old, would you like to participate?
   * If other, end

#### What artifacts do we need to support the research effort?

For the interviews, the following artifacts will be developed:
* Veteran Script
* Stakeholder / IPT Team Script/Questionnaire
* College Veterans Office Representatives Script/Questionnaire
* VSO Script/Questionnaire?

The interview scripts will be ready by: 1/16/2018

For the usability testing, the following artifacts will be developed:
