# VET TEC Application UAT UX Recommendations

The following findings and recommended enhancements for the VET TEC Application (VA Form 22-0994) were compiled following UAT that occurred March 7-11, 2019.  Participants included 6 Veterans who ranged in age from 22-43.

### Veterans wonder what training programs they can take as part of the VET TEC program ###

* On the Intro page, include a link to the static list of approved training programs once it is available on VA.gov. **(TBD)**

* On the Program Selection page, include a link to the static list of approved training programs once it is available on VA.gov. (Alternatively, on the Program Selection page, replace the Program provider and Program name text fields with a Program drop-down that displays a list of available programs.) **(Pending UX Decision, TBD)**  

* On the Program Selection page, update the copy to mention that once Veterans have been approved for the VET TEC program and received a VET TEC Certificate of Eligibility (COE), they can apply for the program. **(Relates to #55 / #17388; however this will likely be a new ticket)**



### Veterans wonder what would happen if they are called for Active Duty during the VET TEC program ###

* Display the note about what happens if you are called up for active duty statically upon page load so all Veterans see it as they complete the form. **(#17 / #17389)**


### Veterans wonder whether their address change will affect the delivery of their prescriptions and appointment ###

* On the Address page, update the copy to mention that the change will not impact health benefits and prescriptions. **(#54)**


### A few Veterans missed the VA Form 22-1990 button as the “Busy Spring” alert pushes the “Start VA Form 22-1990” button below the fold ###

* On the Confirmation page, suppress the “Busy Spring” Alert as it’s irrelevant to VET TEC and distracts users from seeing the confirmation message and the Start VA Form 22-1990 button. **(#43 / #17364)**

*  On the Confirmation page, for Veterans who have not yet submitted VA Form 22-1990, conditionally display an Alert regarding the need to complete VA Form 22-1990. **(TBD, being separated from #43/#17364)**

* Place the “Start VA Form 22-1990” button higher on the page within an informational alert to encourage those who have not yet completed the form to complete it. **(TBD or Add to #43)**



### Veterans would like to receive an email notification after they've completed their application, so they know who to follow up with if there are issues. ###

* Upon submission of the VET TEC application, send the Veteran an email confirmation. (In addition to including the information on the current confirmation page, see the following enhancement for additional content: “Veterans wonder about next steps after applying”.) **(Modify #22 to address this enhancement)**


### Veterans wonder about next steps after applying ###

* On the Confirmation page and on the confirmation email, display copy that lets the user know that they'll be receiving a COE and how they can review a list of available programs. **(Email - Modify #22; Confirmation page - TBD)**


### Veterans who haven't selected a program wonder how they can learn more about them ###

* On the Programs page, statically display the current note to all so Veterans who have 1 or more programs in mind know they are not making a commitment and will have more time to consider their options after they receive a COE. **(#55 / #17388)**


### Static Page Recommendations ###

Here is a list of recommendations for the static page content:

1.	Have the content address the following questions:   
  a.	Is there a limit to the number of certifications one can obtain through VET TEC?    
  b.	Can Veterans use VET TEC multiple times or just once?  
  c.  What certifications can one obtain through VET TEC?  
  d.	Is there a page that has more info on what the certifications are?   
  e.	Does it matter whether the person has Montgomery or Post-911?   
  f.	Can I use VET TEC for programs that are not listed, like Healthcare IT certifications?  
  g.	Can Veterans use VET TEC first and then do 4-year degree program?  
2.	Provide a bulleted list of the various application process hurdles (i.e., VA Form 22-1990, VA Form 22-0994, training program application). 
3.	Provide a bulleted list of the eligibility requirements.
4.	Consider a different treatment for the "VET TEC Veteran Path" heading as people seem to think the purple arrow is a button. Two people stopped and mentioned that they had finished reading the entire page and attempted to click the purple button, which is just a graphic.
5.	The content seems geared towards those who are currently transitioning out of the service.  Consider expanding it to those who transitioned a while back as well.
6.	Consider specifically mentioning that College and University classes that lead to degrees fall under GI Bills, rather than VET TEC.
7.	Address whether Veterans can use VET TEC and a GI Bill simultaneously.
8.	Clarify that VET TEC does not use up GI Bill entitlement.
9.	Ensure that the static page explains that you can apply without selecting a program in advance and mentions that Veterans will receive a COE.
10.	Clarify whether it matters if Veterans fill out the education benefits form before or after the VET TEC form.
11.	Mention how eligibility for VET TEC varies from eligibility for the GI Bills.  Specifically, mention that active duty Servicemembers need to wait until they have separated to take advantage of VET TEC.
12.	Indicate whether the phone number provided is for education benefit questions or for technical support questions. Ideally, provide a phone number for both purposes. Veterans feel there is currently no tech support for VA.gov. 


#### Additional notes regarding the static page: ####
a.	One Veteran mentioned that "The explanation at the beginning was confusing, the graphic cleared it up and the questions made it easier."

b.	One Veteran mentioned that "The icon for VET TEC is interesting. It caught me off guard. The red and blue makes sense, just wasn't expecting it on a VA page...Haven't seen other logos displayed on va.gov." 

c.	Long term: If desired and feasible for VET TEC, add a “Check eligibility” link that checks to see if the Veteran who is logged in has already been approved for education benefits and has at least 1 day remaining.

d.  Three areas where the numbers are misleading:
  1) Nav bar > Contact Us > 1-844 #. 
  2) Applicant info page 1800 # in "Note" for updating profile. 
  3) Need help? footer phone number.   
  One area where no phone # is given for support:   
  When signing in to VA.gov, "Having trouble signing in?" link to submit a request for help only offers a Veterans Crisis Line # and no real tech support # other than the option to submit an online request form for support.

d.	While “Learn” and “Earn” make sense, the term "Turn" seems out of place.

e.	"Media Application" isn't a familiar field
