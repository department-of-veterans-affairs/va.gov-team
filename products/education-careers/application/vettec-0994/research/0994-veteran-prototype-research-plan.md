# Research Plan for VET TEC Prototype Research for the BAH Platform Team, February 2019
(This should be filled out and maintained by the designer on the team & can be cross-linked and referenced in any issues.) 

## Goals
### 1. What product & team are you doing this research for?
This is for the VET TEC form 22-0994. 

### 2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 
We have a unique opportunity to shape Veterans' application experience on a new VA education program that allows them to use their VA Education Benefits for technology training programs. This application is new and will exist solely online, as opposed to having a paper equivalent. OMB Approval of the form will occur during the development cycle. Veterans who have not already applied for educational benefits will need to submit VA Form 22-1990 in addition to VA Form 22-0994. 


### 3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 
- What are Veterans' goals, needs, expectations and behaviors related to applying for educational benefits?
- How can VA make this form easy to understand, so that Veterans can determine their eligibility and share the information needed to submit valid applications? 
- What aspects of the user interface present issues for Veterans? 
- What additional information or contextual help do Veterans need to understand how to complete this form? 

### 4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 
By presenting VA Form 22-0994 in an easy to use interview format, displaying only those questions that relate to the Veteran's specific situation, pre-populating data, presenting contextual help and guiding the Veteran through the process of completing the forms, Vets.gov will offer a simple method for applying for educational benefits. The online VA Form 22-0994 form will make the experience of applying for educational benefits easy and instill in Veterans a sense of confidence in their ability to apply for benefits independently.

Learning about the issues Veterans encounter when completing the form will help us write instructional copy to help them complete the form correctly.

## Method
### 1.	What method of research are you planning? 
Prototype Research (February 4th - 6th): Usability testing on a high-fidelity interactive prototype 
  
### 2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 
Testing the prototype will allow us to ensure that the Veteran can move through the interview easily and will bring to light any questions about areas of the flow that cause confusion. 

### 3.	Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)*
The Interviews will be conducted over the phone.  The online remote usability testing will be conducted via WebEx. The point of contact will be: Amy Knox (Theresa McMurdo 1/28-2/4). The research recruiting contract contact will schedule sessions and provide the incentive.

### 4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 
For our usability testing, we will be testing an interactive InVision prototype. If the site on staging becomes available, we may pivot and test on that.

## Participants and Recruitment
### 1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)

- 6 Veterans
- age 22-45 
- who are interested in applying for educational benefits through the VA 
- who are interested in careers in the technology field 
- who have at least 1 day of VA educational benefits remaining (optional)
- who live in a variety of geographic locations
- who have any level of familiarity with technology
- There are no login requirements


### 2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 

We are planning to use the recruiting contract. 

## When? 
### 1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 

Usability will occur February 4th - 6th

### 2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 
The prototype will be ready for usability testing on January 30th.

### 3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours) 

Usability testing:  30-45 min sessions


### 4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.

Monday, February 4th 10AM to 7PM EST

Tuesday, February 5th 10AM to 11AM and 1PM to 3:30PM EST
