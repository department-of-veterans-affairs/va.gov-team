# UAT Round 2 - Session Summaries 
All of the sessions described here were completed on password-protected Production with real veterans using their ID.me, DS Logon or MyHealthEVet account. The submissions are intercepted, reviewed, processed and deleted by the VA Education team. 

## Session 1
#### Date: 03/07/2019 at 10:00AM
### Key Observations: 
- Address Update Target Is Still Unclear.  P1 STATES (unprompted): That’s concerning. It doesn’t specify whether or not it will not edit my info on the Veteran Health Administration side. I don’t know if my medical deliveries or appointments will be affected by that.
- Issues with 800 #'s on site not being able to provide the VA.gov support they advertise. P1
  - Three areas where the numbers are misleading:
    - 1) VA.gov Nav bar > Contact Us > 1-844 #
    - 2) VET TEC Applicant info page 1800 # in "Note" for updating profile
        - Based on my experience, “VBA 800-827-1000 does not have authority to change your contact information. They referred me to DEERS.”
    - 3) VA.gov Need help? footer phone number
   - For technical questions the form says to call Education Department. The Tier 1 operators cannot help you. “I don’t understand why the number is there if the people at the end of the line can’t answer your questions.”
### General Observations: 
- Redirecting users from va.gov to ebenefits can cause issues with DMDC authentication. The organization that runs the ds logon is called the defense manpowered data center, the DMDC.
  - Additional Context: They [DMDC] have an authentication issue currently that if you're on a DOD network, the security on their networks won't allow you to sign in to ebenefits, va.gov, milconnect, even humana, whatever they're gonna be, that uses a CAC card or ds logon if they're on a federal progeam. This was a huge issue when it was vets.gov before it got rebranded into va.gov where younger veterans and younger servicemenbers trying to use their gi bill benefits trying to transition to the civilian world can't get into it because they can't use their ds logon. So that was my main concern whether or not the vso application was going to be moved into va.gov or if that application was still on ebenefits."
### Follow up
- Veteran would like to be followed up with regarding support of VA.gov. He has submitted 5-6 requests for support on VA.gov and only one has receieved a reply.
