## Session 1
#### Date: 03/07/2019 at 10:00AM
### Key Observations: 
ASKS: Do you have to be signed in to apply for this program? 
ASKS: Does “get help filling out the form” link to eBenefits? 
-	What do you think would happen?
-	What would you have wanted to happen? 
SIGNED INTO VA.GOV
MyHealtheVet. If it was a link for the VSO and it went to eBenefits, depending on my authentication would I already be logged in? This is a problem because people filling out these forms are typically younger veterans. If you’re on a DoD or FED network, security on their networks won’t let you sign in to networks… This was a huge issue when it was VETS.gov before it got rebranded into VA.gov. They couldn’t get into it so they can’t use DS log-in info. 
STATES: Based on my experience, “VBA 800-827-1000 does not have authority to change your contact information. They referred me to DEERS.”
Likes “Application has been saved.” Feature
Sees Updating Your Information Note:
- STATES (unprompted): That’s concerning. It doesn’t specify whether or not it will not edit my info on the Veteran Health Administration side. I don’t know if my medical deliveries or appointments will be affected by that.
- Checks Privacy Policy Box without reading the policy language. 
### General Observations: 
-For questions call Education Department. The Tier 1 operators cannot help you. “I don’t understand why the number is there if the people at the end of the line can’t answer your questions.”
- “Simple and straightforward.  Great knowing that you can … walk away and the information will still be there for you.”

### Follow up
Veteran would like to be followed up with regarding support of VA.gov. He has submitted 5-6 requests for support on VA.gov and only one has receieved a reply. 
### Link to Session Recording: 

#### Below is the context regarding follow up. 
  P1: Are you just developing the application for vet tec or do you have influence on the website more than that?
  
  DT: We have worked on several forms and will continue to do so.
  
  P1: We've been trying to contact the VA with questions about VA.gov because there are a lot of things that don't make sense and we can't get a definitive answer. Here's a great example... up in the top right there is an area that says contact us. If you click on that and go down.... this is the phone number that shows up for the va.gov website (844-2311).

 I don't know if you're familiar with that, but that is just general 311 for the VA.... All they do is redirect you to a department that they hope can help you. They are not technical support...
  
  That is just general 311 for the va. All they do is rediret you to the department that can help you. They are not technical support. I've spoken to seven of their frontline reps and 5 of their supervisors. They very specifically tell you they don't have anything to do with any website. So you ask them... who controls va.gov for technical support assistance, and they'll redirect you to Veteran Benefit Administration.... that 1000 number... I brought up. That 1000 number... VBA.... does not do any support for technical support. They will redirect you to the Health Resource Center. The health resource center only does technical support for MyHealthEVet, Ebenefits and the numerous mobile apps that the VA has. They do not do technical support for VA.gov. They used to have a contract with Vets.gov but they do not do technical support for VA.gov. So, this is a real fun loop you get stuck in. 
  
  Do you folks know of any organization that actually does technical support for VA.gov?
  
  DT: No, I do not I will follow up on that. 
  
  P1: Do you know if there is an organization that does technical support for the website?
  
 DT:  What I know is we provide updates on any newly rolled out programs, and I don't know where those go. That's a question that I will follow up on and I will definitely get an answer on. We'll provide your feedback.
 
  P1: The one thing that does help on one of these applications is having the form number, 22-0994. In Llieu of VA.gov having a technical assistance organization...  we google that form number and even put it into youtube with the form number tutorial and then we watch on youtube somebody else troubleshoot the application or tell you what line on the form the VA wants you to fill out on the form with what information. 
  It would just be really nice because on ebenefits, we had the help desk that we could call up, and a human being would walk me through it. I didn't have to call and get looped 3 times. eBenefits and MyHealthEVet, I could talk to one person and get support. I understand the greater plan is to merge all the greater sites into one umbrella, VA.gov, but if we don't have a call team we could talk to about the website, I'd rather we didn't go into va.gov because I don't have anybody to help me with issues. 
  
  DT: Remind me again, when you needed help for EBenefits or MyHealthEVet who would you call?
  
  P1: You would call the .... for tech issues, such as PW and error codes, you'd call the help desk that falls under the business line health resource center

  For benefits questions...you would call the veteran benefits administration... There are also options for online chat. There are multiple options to contact. 
  On VA. gov, there is an option to "ask a question" here:

  Which I believe goes to IRIS, the Inquiry Routing and Information System:

And you can fill out a form. Inquiry type, there is no option for VA.gov. "All Technical, Password and Access Probs". Have submitted multiple forms here around VA.gov but haven't received a response on any of them. 
 
One last thing, when you go to the sign in page. Having trouble signing in? SUbmit a request to get help signing in. This is cute. The      first part is hey, you can call the crisis line, but there is no contact line for help signing in. It just seems like so much on the      website isn't being supported for technical and navigation support. 
  
  [Has a friend that submitted an appeal on va.gov.] He checked on     va.gov a month and a half ago, and it said that his appeal was finalized. His appeals were done after years of waiting, and that he was   100% disabled, so he called the 1800 numbers, and they told him, no, it is not, the website is wrong. That's a pretty dramatic thing to   have the website information be wrong. There's no actionable course for him to address the data discrepancy on the website. After         several years of waiting, you know, he can finally start living his life, he was gutshot. We were livid when they took claims status and   appeals status off of ebenefits. It's not the fastest, but it's accurate and we can call somebody. With va.gov, there's no option for     that.
