# UAT Recruiting Messaging

## Form 22-0994 Initial Recruiting Messaging
Below is the initial recruiting message to be sent to veterans in an effort to recruit UAT participants.

### For general interest:
The VA is currently developing a new tool to support the Veteran Employment through Technology Education Courses (VET TEC) pilot program. As part of this effort, we are seeking veterans who are interested in applying for this program as we initiate beta testing of the new application.

This program allows veterans to enroll in courses that are outside the traditional definition of higher education to obtain skillsets highly desired by employers.

To participate in this program, the following must be true:

- You are interested in enrolling in courses outside the traditional definition of higher education to obtain skillsets highly desired by employers in the high tech industry
- You are eligible for any education benefit and have remaining entitlement (benefits remaining)
- You are not on active duty and do not expect to be on active duty while receiving this benefit

If you meet the above requirements and youâ€™re interested in participating in beta testing, respond to [BAH team member email address] with your phone number and your availability to participate in a 5-10 minute call to cover some basic questions so we can make sure you are eligible to participate. We anticipate these sessions will begin on February 19, 2019.

Please feel free to share this information with others you know who might be interested in participating.

Thank you again,
