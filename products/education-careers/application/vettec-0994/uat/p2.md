### Key Observations: 
"So simple, I don’t know how much simpler that can get."

### General Observations: 
“So many passwords – we’re pampered by the phones that recognize you by your face.”
ASKS: If Veteran has used all their benefits they don’t qualify? 
Currently works in High Tech but when asked which industry – Selects “None of these” (He’s an IT Project Manager)
Notes that his address in the application is wrong but doesn’t update it. 
Opens all panels on the Application Review page. 

TM: Where would your address update be reflected? 
Participant 2: I am going to assume it only goes to the VET TEC people because I know how disconnected the VA is. A normal Veteran probably thinks it goes everywhere.  

### Follow up
Veteran would like to be followed up with regarding support of VA.gov. He has submitted 5-6 requests for support on VA.gov and only one has receieved a reply.
