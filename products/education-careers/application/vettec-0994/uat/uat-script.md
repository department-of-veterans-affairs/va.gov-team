# UAT Script

## Script for Recruited Veterans on Production
### Introduction
Hi ______. Welcome! My name is Desiree Turner and I work with the team that built the new form for a pilot program on VA.gov that we’d like you to review today.

### Thank you!
So, first of all thank you for your willingness to participate in this session. Your participation allows us to ensure that other veterans who will be using this form in the future will have a good experience. The form you’ll be completing is an application for a new pilot program called VET TEC (Veteran Employment through Technology Education Courses) that will provide veterans with the opportunity to participate in high-tech trainings, like coding schools. 

### Purpose
So, for today’s session we’d like to have you walk through the application process as if you are applying for VET TEC  yourself. There are no right or wrong answers or ways of completing the application. We also encourage you to think out loud so we can better understand your perspective.

You can use real or fake information as you complete the application but know that your information for some of the content will be pre-filled because you will be logged into your account. Upon completion of your session, we will delete your application so that it is not processed.

Do you have any questions?

### Observers
Note that there are a few other individuals on the line observing. They also work with the team who developed this tool and are going to be capturing your feedback. 

### Recording 
Lastly, we generally record sessions, in case we need to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. Are you comfortable if I record our session today?

Great! I'm going to turn on screen and audio recording now.  When we hear an announcement that it’s started, I’ll ask again if you are okay if we record the audio so we have your verbal consent.

[The meeting host will begin audio and screen recording.]

Are you comfortable if I record this session?


### Getting Started
[ Facilitator shares their screen while showing the VET TEC intro page]

We’re going to begin by having you review the following page that describes the VET TEC program. As you’re reviewing it feel free to think out loud and provide any feedback or questions you might have about it.
https://www.benefits.va.gov/GIBILL/fgib/VetTec_Veteran.asp

### VET TEC Application
[ Facilitator shares their screen and grants the veteran access to control their screen]

https://staging.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/vettec-high-tech-program/apply-for-vettec-form-22-0994/introduction 
- Note that in order to access this page you will be prompted for username (veterans) and password (usausausa)
- Request that the veteran select "no" in response to "have you previously applied for education benefits" so that we can test the 1990.

Upon conclusion, remind the veteran to log out of the application
