# UAT Round 1 - Session Notes

## Session 1 - With veteran submitting fake data on staging
### Key Observations
- On program Selection page:
   - The veteran said "What I was looking for was a drop down menu [of programs]."  
   - The veteran mentioned that it would be helpful to have a dropdown to select the year the program starts. 
      - We like this idea – mitigates typing issues, in particular.
- Would be nice to have a drop-down that listed the names of the programs.
- Veteran knew where to go to find information on educational programs
- Veteran did know where to look for the VET TEC application. He navigated to the How To Apply page on VA.gov.

### General Observations*
- Intro - Scrolled down quickly and easily found the start button at the bottom of the page; only briefly reviewed content.

- Having an issue with the phone number entry - attempted to enter periods like 555.555.5555
- Read the 1990 helper text, but skipped the National Guard helper text
- Flew through banking
- Knew how to open and close the collapsible sections on the review page
