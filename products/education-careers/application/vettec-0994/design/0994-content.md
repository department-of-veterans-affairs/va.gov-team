{ help-text} 

The Department of Treasury requires all federal benefit payments be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), also called direct deposit. 

If you don’t have a bank account, or don’t wish to provide your bank account information, you must receive your payment through Direct Express Debit MasterCard. To request a Direct Express Debit MasterCard, apply at [www.usdirectexpress.com]() or call [1-800-333-1795](). 

If you choose not to enroll, you’ll need to call the Department of Treasury at [1-888-224-2950]() and speak to a representative handling waiver requests. They’ll encourage you to participate in EFT and address any questions or concerns you have.
