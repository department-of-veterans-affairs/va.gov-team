From Matt Self on 1/4/19:


Hey Gang,

                Thanks, Everyone for taking the time to chat. As we kick-off the implementation of the Vettec feature, I appreciate you all being so understanding while we figure out how all of these teams  should work together!

 

                Notes from our discussion:
BAH will adhere to the guidelines and checkpoints suggested by the Handbook for this implementation
BAH will use the existing DSVA repos (vets-api and vets-website) for development and management of the Vettec feature
Initial solution proposal calls for minor interaction between the new Vettec feature and the existing 1990 form; design guidance on the integration between Vettec and  1990 will be overseen by Apps Team design lead Samara
The following people have subject matter expertise related to EDU forms previously launched on the platform (i.e., the 1990): 
Back-End EDU Forms: Lihan Li
Front-End EDU Forms: Rian Fowler
Product Knowledge of EDU Forms (i.e., 1990): Ryan Luu
Design POC: Samara Strauss
 

Action Items:
James: As BAH begins development on Vettec, they plan to keep their stubbed-out front-end in a separate branch until they  reach the appropriate checkpoints, but have proposed merging their back-end schema and controllers into master, since it will be inaccessible via the front-end; this is what they did for the ancillary forms; does anyone see an issue with this?
Leah/Brian: Can you coordinate an intro discussion with the POCs listed above (Lihan, Rian, and Ryan) so that BAH can work  with them as needed as they get moving on Vettec?
