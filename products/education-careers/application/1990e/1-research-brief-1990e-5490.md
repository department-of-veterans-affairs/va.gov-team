# Research Brief

## Goal and Research Questions

Make sure that the 22-5490 and 22-1990E are clear to applicants

### Key research questions

- Are there any confusing questions?
- Are there any parts of the form that are hard to fill out?

### Details:

Week of 3/13

Is this tied to a deadline?

#### What are we evaluating?

Usability.

#### Recruitment

These forms are for dependents who are applying for education benefits. The 5490 can be used in High School (though that is rare)

Applicants are applying to be reimbursed for education costs.

3-4 participants

SVA folks might be helpful. Not sure if there are additional complications in researching with high school age participants. Again, high school use is a minor case.
