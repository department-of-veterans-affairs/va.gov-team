# 22-1990E feedback synthesis

## Goals
- Make sure the form is clear to applicants

## Summary


## What worked well


## What didnâ€™t work well


## Methodology
This was four remote feedback sessions. Participants stepped through the 1990E form via screenshare and rendered feedback. Participants came from SVA (and other?) outreach.


## Raw Feedback

### 1 of 8 Applicant Information
#### G.B.
- Fills out Name and chooses II suffix
- Fills in SSN / DOB
- One thing maybe to indicate that it needs to be a 4 digit year, might be confusing to some

### 2 of 8 Benefit Eligibility
#### G.B.
- Chooses Mont GI Bill and cont

### 3 of 8 Sponsor Information
#### G.B.
- Types in information
- When you got to this page, was anything confusing? "No not at all really"
- Types in address information
- That field may be better to be a drop down menu with all the branches of service
- Taking a minute with the check box
- Hits continue

#### J.W.
- Specifying "Veteran" in front of fields pertaining to them is helpful


### 4 of 8 Education History
#### G.B.
- Fills in Date
- Anything confusing? Seems pretty straightforward for me.
- Paused on high school trainings. A little confused if I needed to put name of college or degree, had to read it a couple of times.
- Name of college expected to be in a separate field, name of training and then name of institution
- Type of degree? MA/BA/assoc? Which one are you looking for
- [hovered over add another] expected that it would be for add another degree.
* Education history: paused to figure out: would prefer 2 separate questions, e.g. "post-high school trainings" seems to refer to the field, e.g. electrical engineering, while "Name of college" is the actual institution.

### 5 of 8 Employment History
#### G.B.
- Have you ever held, checked the box
- Entered in Journeyman Electrician and other info
- This all looks pretty straightforward

#### J.W.
- Seems odd to have a single question on a page (Chapter 5) --> Better to have this as a Yes/No question


### 6 of 8 School Selection
#### G.B.
- You're asking me now twice for college education?
- Looks like you're asking me twice for all my college education when I first see it.
- Didn't get that where it asks where you want to go to school.
- Didnt read the very top, the title board when you're going through it it becomes more unneccessary noise and missing the meat where it shows transferred benefits
- "or even something on the right hand side or a bubble with what this is about."
- [what would you put there] I would just put a synopsis of what you're asking.
- Enters information.
- I think the oversight was just me, missing the first part of it.
- [no, i dont think that was the problem - ideally we dont have people trying to figure out what the question is]
- Some of these questions (are you getting or do you expect to get any money) starts to get convoluted, so Id ont know if its because I dont get those things that I dont know what to expect the answer should be. Maybe those getting it would understand it better.
- To the right show examples like "pell grant, etc"
- suggestions to show if they either did or didnt apply to them
- More straightforward with the examples.
* Looks like it's asking again (for second time) for his college history (i.e., looks similar to the education history on first glance); would like more information about what this page is about, e.g. synopsis about what you're asking, e.g., "transfer of credits from point A to point B"
* Tuition assistance question seems "convoluted"; he has not received this, so doesn't understand the question. Some examples would be helpful, e.g. "Pell grant." Examples could help people know whether it does or doesn't apply to them
* Career goals: examples make it straight-forward
* Contact information: would like all-of-the-above instead of radio


#### J.W.
- Confused about the federal tuition assistance question (she would probably enter no; her daughter would probably enter Yes because she's applying for benefits now)


### 7 of 8 Personal Information
#### G.B.
- Could i choose all the above (preferred contact)
- More email and phone these days than mail
- Enters in address

- Trying to copy and paste email address.
- Is that typically what you do? "Yeah, always"

- Direct Deposit
 - This is all straightforward.
 - Those are pretty typical of any of those online submittal forms.
 - Similar to things like applying for a credit card or really anything.


### 8 of 8 Review
#### G.B.
- IF I wanted to add another how easy is that, clicks edit.
 - Okay, simple enough
 - Clicks submit, gets error on " I have Read"
 - Clicks Submit after check box.


### Follow up questions
#### G.B.
**1. What parts of the process seemed confusing or required extra work?**
- Probably thinking back on the dates. Trying to go back 30 years. "cuz im old I guess"
- Biggest point is the school question felt redundant. Or why are they on different pages.
- Do I have to go back and correct what I did, if that is really what I needed to put that.
- Hard to know exact dates, since thinking back 30 years
- Felt like school selection was redundant; why doing similar things on 2 different pages; wondering if he filled out the previous page wrong, so now has to go back and fix


**2.  If you could wave a magic wand and improve three things in the application process, what would they be? What would the magically improved version be like?**
- Mentioned: on one page in one field section. Name of school, degree, keep that all together.
- add in multiples on the one page.
- Just to have the same screen for asking other educational institutional information.
- The white space on the right ahdn side (did some web design)
 - White space would not apply. Trying to think about how you would making it mobile compliant, you're limiting how much you can tell the person from the device.
- The one question that he stumbled on Receiving money from another US Gov. Maybe make that a little more explanatory / examples.
- With turbotax, they explain certain things a little bit more, hover, or bubble, so you can read more about that question.
How do you explain it without over explaining? A link, or pop up
- Clearer explanation/examples about what the school selection tuition assistance question means


**3. What are the easiest parts of the process that should be kept as-is?**
- This seems as easy as applying for a credit card. This doesnt seem like its that difficult.
- eBenefits for instance: Have never submitted anything through ebenefits

- Works as a VSO. Helped a Veteran get access.
