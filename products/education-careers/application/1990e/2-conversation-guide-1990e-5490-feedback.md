### Welcome and Opening Remarks (5 minutes)
*[When the participant is ready, the moderator will begin the session with the following introduction.]*

Thank you for joining us today. My name is [NAME] and we also have [NAME OF OTHERS OBSERVING] observing and taking notes for this session. We are doing this website feedback session on behalf of the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs working to build a new website that will help veterans get easier access to the benefits they deserve.

We’re working on a new version of an Education Benefits form and we’d like to see how it works for real people.

Before we begin, I’d like to make a few things clear and explain how the session will work.

  * We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.
  * We aren’t testing your ability. We’re just trying to figure out what works well on the website, and what doesn’t work well. So there are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions and what you think so that we can make the site better. I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.
  * This entire feedback session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question or task.
  * We’ll be recording the screen activities as we look at the site. Recording our discussion today will help us capture everything you say accurately.
  * If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

In this session, we’d like you to show you a prototype of a form for applying for education benefits as a dependent and just talk us through your impressions as you go. Please think out loud as you are moving through the form.

### Main questions

- Can you tell me a little about yourself?
- Could you tell me about what VA education benefits you have used?
  - Have you used Education Benefits transferred from a parent or spouse?
- We’d like to run through two Education Benefit forms today. We’ll do one of them and you can give you feed back before we move on to the second.

- Please imagine that you are trying to sign up for education benefits transferred to you by a spouse or parent.

  1. What parts of the process seemed confusing or required extra work?
  2.  If you could wave a magic wand and improve three things in the application process, what would they be? What would the magically improved version be like?
  3. What are the easiest parts of the process that should be kept as-is?

- Please imagine that you are trying to sign up for education benefits as a spouse or child of a Veteran who is unavailable to transfer their benefits.
