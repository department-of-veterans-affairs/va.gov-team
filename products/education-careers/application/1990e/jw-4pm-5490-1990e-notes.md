User Testing Notes: JW

- Just starting to use VA services next week
- In the process of being medically retired (final out date is March 20)
- She has a couple of appointments scheduled with the VA next week
- She's never used education benefits, but hopes to
- She's used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before
- She likes to go through things really thoroughly as she does them because she has some memory issues (she likes to write things down as a tool to help her remember things)

### 5490 feedback:
#### Intro
- Step 1: unclear if the information needed is the Veteran's or the dependents' (she thinks the Veteran's)
- The link to "accredited representative" should open in a new window
- Step 2: she thought the language on "Complete this form" was clickable

#### Chapter 1
- There's a whole thing in the military right now around gender and being more flexible on gender identification

#### Chapter 2
- Doesn't know which benefit to select (could use more explanation on what these are)
- Is the effective date the day school begins? Could this be labeled more effectively?
- "Is disability the VA disability benefits or Social Security disability benefits? A lot of us are on Social Security disability." --> on page with checkbox list

#### Chapter 3
- Unclear if it's the applicant's SSN that's needed or the Veteran's
- It makes sense to her to refer to the Veteran as the "Sponsor"
- consolidate references to Veteran/Sponosor/o

#### Chapter 8
- She might specify on the applicant information page exactly where each information is being collected

### 1990e feedback:
- Specifying "Veteran" in front of fields pertaining to them is helpful
- Seems odd to have a single question on a page (Chapter 5) --> Better to have this as a Yes/No question
- Confused about the federal tuition assistance question (she would probably enter no; her daughter would probably enter Yes because she's applying for benefits now)
