# Education Benefits Application Research with Veterans

## Participant 1 (1pm ET): 22-5490 only

### Main questions


- Please imagine that you are trying to sign up for education benefits transferred to you by a spouse or parent.

  1. What parts of the process seemed confusing or required extra work?
     * Confustion/frustration of language for people with PTSD or other conditions
     * Dates of service: understanding how to deal with multiple service periods, some active duty v. national guard/reserve; dates are calculated differently, so hard to fill this out correctly
     * Time-outs: wondering if this will time-out/save info, because the applicant will likely need to go find that information and it may take a while. Need to know beforehand that this information is needed so that people don't start form without this information.

  2.  If you could wave a magic wand and improve three things in the application process, what would they be? What would the magically improved version be like?

  3. What are the easiest parts of the process that should be kept as-is?
     * Likes the opportunity to review and edit everything at the end
     * Likes when examples are provided, e.g. career goal

### Raw notes

  * Instructions: "Instructions are very straightforward." Appreciates seeing what information will be needed to proceed with form. "Very clear"
  * Benefit Selection: expects "None" to be at the bottom; similarly to how multiple-choice questions list "All of the above" at the bottom. Seeing it first struck him as off.
  * Military Service/Sponsor Veteran:
    * Word choice made sense to the participant. The word sponsor "makes perfect sense." 
    * Not surprised by required fields and/or red error messages. Used to seeing this in other web applications.
    * SSN: "(dashes allowed)" wasn't clear to him; assumed the error message was showing because he did not include dashes (though actually it was that the entered SSN did not have 9 digits); would either expect the dashes to be automatically inserted
  * Military Service/Sponsor Service: word "account" seems off to him. Would prefer the word "benefit." If someone needs to decipher and put a lot of thought into understanding words, could be frustrating. Specifically mentioned that someone with PTSD might be using this.
  * Military Service/Applicant Service
    * Asked for verification that this question is not for the service person but for the applicant (relative).
    * Start/end of service period: wonering if start/end of "service period" means start/end of "enlistment." Some people start on national guard and reserve and switch over to active duty, or vice versa. So "service" could mean either one. Would prefer the question to specify which of these (national guard or active duty) is meant by "service period."
    * Follow-up on above comment: once he saw the "Add another" button, understands why the word service is used: because people have multiple enlistments (as he mentioned above).
    * Problem: the family member may not have all of the dates of service of the sponsor veteran. The service member would have those dates, but if s/he is deceased, it could be challenging if the relative does not have that information in front of self.
  * Military Service/Contributions: seems confused by these questions, but I didn't catch why; asked for a better way to phrase these questions
  * Education History
    * Wondering if this page is only asking for high school information on this page. First dropdown (about high school): worried that you need to be a high school graduate or GED holder to get the benefit.
  * Employment History
    * Length: surprised that the length of time is in months, not years; would expect both years and months; at first glance, someone might input years here instead without giving it much thought 
    * License or rating: seems unusual and not something people are familiar hor have seen before, since typical job applications (e.g. a restaurant applications) don't ask this
  * School Selection
    * Type of education: "Is there any reason wny these are listed in this order?" Recommends alphabetical order.
    * Confused by "restorative training" is; if it's rehab, would prefer it to just say rehab; even if college-educated, would not know what this is
  * Contact Information: Some people don't use email. Would not make this required. Some people don't use technology.
