# Education Benefits Application Research with Veterans


### Main questions

- Can you tell me a little about yourself?

Elaine
Army 30 years. Includes reserve, national guard, active duty
Retired: 2012
Submitted disability packet 5 days after retired. 1st week of Sept. Got first check first of April.
Packet went through quickly bc I was really organized (HR Background).  
Did exit physical.  Did VA physical and it was easy. Feels like not enough people do this. Tells friend to document everything before retiring.

- Could you tell me about what VA education benefits you have used?

AD: 5 years and then went Army Reserve. Used GI BIll and kicker to pay for Bachelor’s Degree.  Used reserve component 1606 to pay for more coursework.

Went back to AD. Used TA to pay for Master’s Degree. Was GI Bill Manager for Nat’l Guard 2000, 2001. (Before Post 9/11 GI Bill).  Already 36 months and 1606 -- which took her to 48 months. Couldn’t use any more.

When she retired. Used R-GAP (?? unclear about name). Was not eligible bc she was told she had 12 months left on her GI Bill. This is despite being told she was at her limit.  Didn’t know she had it. She’s looking at ways to use those months now. Perhaps to start a pHd or get some specialized training.


  - Have you used Education Benefits transferred from a parent or spouse?
- We’d like to run through two Education Benefit forms today. We’ll do one of them and you can give you feed back before we move on to the second.

### 5490 landing page
(1) Whose education history? Mine or the sponsor?
Whose SSN? I would think the Soldier’s because you are tapping into their benefit.
VSO and GI Bill lines -- seem weird in that spot.
Doesn’t know what a VSO is
Could put in examples
Ask questions like, ‘do you know what you want to study?  If not, you can ask a VSO” or “Do you know where you want to study”
She suggests a ‘Before you start, make sure you have all these items on hand.” Then say, if you don’t know where you want to go to school and what you want to study, <insert: GIBCT and VSO information>
(3) Comment about transition - we already changed this copy
(4) Doesn’t know what a COE is (at bottom of page). “It wasn’t explained earlier”
Suggests:
What happens if it’s not approved?
Should they call after 30 days if they don’t hear something?
Tell them they won’t get their payment for at least 30 days

### 1 of 8
SSN -- say whether it’s with our without dash
Date of birth - what form
Why isn’t it a dropdown for year?

### 2 of 8
2 of 8 Education Benefit.  Not necessary to have that title at the top. Does that mean I get 8 benefits? Just put 2 of 8 pages.
I have no idea what DEA is or FRY. Should have a link in there explaining what they are and eligibility. Can you click both?
Effective date?  What is that?  I guess it’s probably the start date of school. I’ll put in June because I’m going to summer school.

Clicked continue. Are we still on 2?  I’m confused.
Do you want to know if me or my husband (sponsor) received any of the following benefits? I haven’t done VRE but my husband has.
OTHER: I used tuition assistance so that’s a benefit. She filled it out fine.


### 3 of 8:
Surprised about step-children being eligible. Her stepdaughter is Canadian. Now filling out as if she were applying as the step-daughter
Whose branch of service?  Mine or the sponsor?
Confused about who the qualifying individual?  Sponsor is the better term!
Does the warrant question include traffic warrants?  If I say yes, will this disqualify me?  There are a lot of Veterans who have charges against them. They need schooling. Maybe clarify.
Add Another:  The new period of service is confusing. People do go in and out … should clarify that she went in and out, and then in again up front. List all active duty periods. Are you trying to prove that they are INeligible or Eligible?
I’m assuming that you will ask me for the DD214 at some point in this application. I had FOUR before I retired and then when I retired, they rolled them all into one DD214. Will I have to upload it?  Better explanation about the expectations.
I’d be moaning and groaning right now because I need to pull my DD214.  I might quit and call the VSO. I might go back and only put in one service period to make it easier.
High school question:  Add an ‘other’ to account for homeschoolers


### 5 of 8:
REALLY?  You need all this?  Ugh

### 6 of 8:
I like the examples for career goals
Date training began- should ask this at the beginning
Don’t know what restorative training is
Vocational:  thinks it’s a certificate for like a tech program
Can I go to school in Australia or other than US?
Would you like to receive vocational and educational counseling?  What kind of counseling?  Online or phone? With the school or with VA?  What are you talking to me about?  Picking classes? Or is someone with VA going to help me about the financial stuff? Suggestion:  Add bullets for options about what they want ^.

### 7 of 8:
Address. Where I am living right now when I’m setting all this up
Why are you asking me for this? I picked email.
You should have them choose 2 in case they enter in wrong information. Or better yet, fill out all of them.
Address:  Where she is now or if she’s moving soon to school, do you want school address? Or if it’s an online school, what should they enter?
Secondary contact: I expect it to populate the fields for me.
DD:  Suggests please select one.
She wants to put the person’s name. Especially if the student is young and the parents want the money to be transferred to their account.
Will that direct deposit work in a foreign account
What should she do with questions about this?


### 8 of 8: 
Take off ‘application’ at top. Just have review
I can scroll through and open. Good.
Note:  It’s not a complete thought. Should have ‘on a government form’
Privacy policy link opened in a new window. Confused her.

Confirmation:
What to do if it’s longer than 30 days
Tell them to take this form to the school certifying official in case there is a problem.
What’s no documents required?  Confused. This tells me that I uploaded everything but I didn’t upload anything. Wasted block. Take it off.


NOTES:
List stuff you need and what you don’t need
What happens if I have a warrant?  You didn’t give me a place to upload documents that show that I got it taken care of. So they might lie on the form when they see that question.


- Please imagine that you are trying to sign up for education benefits transferred to you by a spouse or parent.

  1. What parts of the process seemed confusing or required extra work?

The time frames when someone was in the military.

  2.  If you could wave a magic wand and improve three things in the application process, what would they be? What would the magically improved version be like?

Show the finished document?  Instead of sections. Would like to print the whole thing out in case I need to re-submit or take it to school officials.
Make sure the path to get to the page is easy.
