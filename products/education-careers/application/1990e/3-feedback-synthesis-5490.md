# 22-5490 feedback synthesis

## Goals
- Make sure the form is clear to applicants

## Summary
- Forms collecting information on more than one person need more specific labels
  - It may seem redundant, but in every case, specific labels make a difference for applicants with memory impairments
- Examples help clear up broad questions
- There is interest in email as a channel
- Other benefits need explanation

## What worked well
- Progress bar got called out as helpful
- Review section was well received
- Overall clear (but a few confusing parts)
- Sponsor!

## What didn’t work well
- Effective Date label confused some
- Learn more links confused some, “where am I?”
- Meta: some screen sharing issues with GTM (hard to scroll)
- Meta: had to walk two participants through GTM download.

## Methodology
This was four remote feedback sessions. Participants stepped through the 5490 form via screenshare and rendered feedback. Participants came from SVA (and other?) outreach.

## Raw feedback

### 5490 landing page

#### E.G.
1. Whose education history? Mine or the sponsor?
- Whose SSN? I would think the Soldier’s because you are tapping into their benefit.
- VSO and GI Bill lines -- seem weird in that spot.
- Doesn’t know what a VSO is
- Could put in examples
- Ask questions like, ‘do you know what you want to study?  If not, you can ask a VSO” or “Do you know where you want to study”
- She suggests a ‘Before you start, make sure you have all these items on hand.” Then say, if you don’t know where you want to go to school and what you want to study, <insert: GIBCT and VSO information>
2. *no comment*
3. Comment about transition - we already changed this copy
4. Doesn’t know what a COE is (at bottom of page). “It wasn’t explained earlier”

Suggests:
- What happens if it’s not approved?
- Should they call after 30 days if they don’t hear something?
- Tell them they won’t get their payment for at least 30 days

#### G.B.
- I like how it gives you everything you need before you start this. Thats handy
- Would there be anybody on this form to contact, once you submitted the form, how would someone be able to get a status if it was over 30 days?  See some contact information. a lot of Veterans have the waiting game to deal with some of this stuff.
- Hey it went through and someone is working on it.

- Will they get an authorization through email or anything.
  - Will they get an email or anything?  

#### J.D.
- Scrolls down, and up
- reading all the lines
- hit continue
- Did that seem clear/confusing?:  Instructions were very straightforward on the left. Liked how it was broken down as far as the one two and three and it was very clear before getting started that I needed X information, that was real good information to have. It looks very clear
- Click continue

#### J.W.
- Step 1: unclear if the information needed is the Veteran's or the dependents' (she thinks the Veteran's)
- The link to "accredited representative" should open in a new window
- Step 2: she thought the language on "Complete this form" was clickable


### 1 of 8 Applicant Information

#### E.G.
- SSN -- say whether it’s with our without dash
- Date of birth - what form
- Why isn’t it a dropdown for year?

#### G.B.
- Just breezing through now with random info

#### J.D.
- Do you want me to go in and type in the information that is required?
- Enter FN, MN, LN, SSN w/DOB, scroll up, "self explanatory"
- Clicked Continue

#### J.W.
- There's a whole thing in the military right now around gender and being more flexible on gender identification

### 2 of 8 Benefit Eligibility

#### E.G.
- 2 of 8 Education Benefit.  Not necessary to have that title at the top. Does that mean I get 8 benefits? Just put 2 of 8 pages.
- I have no idea what DEA is or FRY. Should have a link in there explaining what they are and eligibility. Can you click both?
- Effective date?  What is that?  I guess it’s probably the start date of school. I’ll put in June because I’m going to summer school.

Clicked continue.
- Are we still on 2?  I’m confused.
- Do you want to know if me or my husband (sponsor) received any of the following benefits? I haven’t done VRE but my husband has.
OTHER: I used tuition assistance so that’s a benefit. She filled it out fine.

#### G.B.
- Some type of pop up. That explains these two benefits.
  - I should not have to go google what CH 35 or Fry scholarship is. Have something there that tells me about each benefit
- What would the effective date be? When I start school? That's why I asked. I dont know.
- Someone starting this from scratch, how often is a dependent involved with VA. This may be a first time exposure to VA, so I guess putting the effective date of what? putting that in there. Of school? Of what? Date you are [X]

- Section 2 - Clicks none
  - Might be some place to explain. Would all dependents know what these different benefits?
  - Definitions or some way to find out more
  - Would I know that I was receiving DIC if I was a 16 or 17 year old kid?
  - I have Veterans not even realize they are receiving or eligible for receiving benefits.
  - Unsure if its an educational barrier or terminology thing. Maybe it wasn’t explained to them thoroughly. Also questions that, how can you not know.    

#### J.D.
- Chose DEA chpt 35
- Effective date: chose Mar 13, 2016 "pretty self explanatory"
- Bars at the top tells me how far I am in the application, thats good
- Reads top of 2 of 8, prior to application have you ever received.
- Whats the reason for None being first as opposed to the bottom? Moving forward, I think kind of like anything, like when you take standardized test, from a mindset, A B C or D or all of the above. When I see the first thing being none, I would expect none to be at the bottom because that is the way that when I look at forms, they are that way. D all of the above. Choices and then None. Being first kind of throws it off.
- Chose Voc Rehab
- Hit continue

#### J.W.
- Doesn't know which benefit to select (could use more explanation on what these are)
- Is the effective date the day school begins? Could this be labeled more effectively?
- "Is disability the VA disability benefits or Social Security disability benefits? A lot of us are on Social Security disability." --> on page with checkbox list


### 3 of 8 Sponsor Information

#### E.G.
- Surprised about step-children being eligible. Her stepdaughter is Canadian. Now filling out as if she were applying as the step-daughter
- Whose branch of service?  Mine or the sponsor?
- Confused about who the qualifying individual?  Sponsor is the better term!
- Does the warrant question include traffic warrants?  If I say yes, will this disqualify me?  There are a lot of Veterans who have charges against them. They need schooling. Maybe clarify.
- Add Another:  The new period of service is confusing. People do go in and out … should clarify that she went in and out, and then in again up front. List all active duty periods.
- Are you trying to prove that they are Ineligible or Eligible?
- I’m assuming that you will ask me for the DD214 at some point in this application. I had FOUR before I retired and then when I retired, they rolled them all into one DD214. Will I have to upload it?  Better explanation about the expectations.
- I’d be moaning and groaning right now because I need to pull my DD214.  I might quit and call the VSO. I might go back and only put in one service period to make it easier.
- High school question:  Add an ‘other’ to account for homeschoolers

#### G.B.
- This seems simple.
- Name of Sponsor - What is that? I don’t know what a Sponsor is. Would that be my father or mother who was deceased and getting their CH35 benefits. In parenthesis - who's the benefactor.

- Sponsor service
  - I guess I would know if my father or mother was on active duty or not, I guess I would know the answer. Wondering if a 17 year old would know that. What is the audience going to know.
  - Simple enough for other Qs.

 - The progress bar at the top is nice to know.

#### J.D.
- Military History: Reads line. Clicks spouse or surviving spouse, reads questions. Chooses no for divorce/annul. Chooses no for did you get remarried.
  - Do the names for things make sense to you?  What is your relationship to the SM... lmt for one second: I tink that flows, makes sense and then moving forward from a SM point of view... self explanatory... SRP for updating medical records, when we review before or after deployment. We get asked those questions often when we do our SGLI for insurance. I think that portion at the very top, that flows.
   - Reads other two questions: That makes sense
   - How bout the word Sponsor:  Sponsor makes perfect sense, a lot of times active duty retirees, everyting is ran and generated off of our ssn. If my wife calls tricare and sets up an appt, and its all set up under my SSN. THey track it from DEERS that its under his SSN so they always ask for the sponsor or Servicemember. Most verbage is usually the sponsor.
- Scrolls down, goes through each question and tries to hit continue. Gets red response.
 - Were you surprised that those were required? No not at all.  A lot of times I guess they are required because of DEERS, thats not uncommon. When Im a SM when we go to update the ID part, those are normal questions that we'd be asked and that would be something that the system that verfieis our family, that does make sense.
 - In context of the form: were you surprised to get na error: No, when it turned red, no, I think that is something now a days that a majority of people that if its not filled out that you cant proceed and move forward.
 - Types in SSN. Unsure if should use same Social as last time. Most systems that ill come across. AFter I type in the first three, the dash would appear after the first three itself. Or when you type in the number that it would just read straight 9 digits all by itself without any dashes. Left it unclear. When its not clear and you go and type everything in and you push cotinue, it can be a little frustrating sometimes even though it is something that simple.
  - Enters DOB.
  - Enters Date of death and hits continue.
 - **Section 2**
- Branch of service. Types US Army and clicks no for active duty
- Reads questions outloud.
-  Re-reads the
 ***Instead of saying account, on whose benefit you're claiming (the word account just seems off to me).***
-  I would imagine that some of the soldiers that fill out this form, that they would have some kind of PTSD and are dpenedent on what we've seen during our service. Some of thsoe things can be a bit agitating.
  -  [You were talking about PTSD: Was that about the wording of a question or if the question was being clear?] "That goes back to the use of the word account as opposed to benefit. Just those small things like that, from my perspective that if i have to sit and figure out how to decipher, if I have to give it a whole lot of thought, it can be frustrating.
 -   On this page with Military History
  -  Have you ever served on active duty. ASking person that is filling this out right?  (correct)
  - Enters Army, reads each section outloud.
   - (Entering information to fill out the most information - hitting yes to go through that)

- When you say start of service period and end of service period. We normally look at enlistment (start of enlistment) and end of enlistment. As opposed to, i understand service, but when you say service you might have people that start on NG or reserve. Some go NG to Res and some go NG/Res. That could be conflicting if they have multiple kinds of service.
- IF you have both how do you think you would do that within this form. You would almost have to prompt another question in there. have you ever service in active duty and if so, National Guard or Active Duty. A question along those lines would have to be asked. when you say Service
- Trying to figure out my exact thought process. When I see service I think enlistment period.
- Fills it out.
- Step 3 - Applicant Service
  - Now I kind of understand, when I was saying NG or Reserve? When I was saying SErvice. Now Im seeing the Add another. Iw oudl think there has to be another way, to simplify this without having to add services. You may have some people that will come in as a NG, and then come off and then join active duty. They may have 3 or 4 breaks in service. I undertsand why now the word service is used as opposed to enlist. I dont know I just know that as far as filling out forms but there amy not be a reasonf or this. having all those different breaks of service it is the responsibility of the SM who had those dates, the problem you will run into is what if the family member doesnt have all those date. The form is for mia, kia, if they were themselves a SM it would be easier. Because ti is geared towards a family member, it could be challening if they dont have the dd214 in front of them.
- Hits continue.
 - (3 of 8 - Contributions)
- Reads question
- I guess with that, clicks Yes. To see what the question is.
- So when you say benefits, hmm, do you mean pay or... or other government assistant programs. (What do you think?) My thought process, well with this form it pertains to education, so the question you are asking if theyre receiving benefits. It doesnt seem that it is clear as to what type of benefits, health? education? or some other type of benefit?
- That would be hard in some people's cases, that would be hard to... that is kind of a complex.. maybe there is another way to reask that question.
- Hits continue

#### J.W.
- Unclear if it's the applicant's SSN that's needed or the Veteran's
- It makes sense to her to refer to the Veteran as the "Sponsor"
- consolidate references to Veteran/Sponosor/o


### 4 of 8 Education History
#### E.G.

#### G.B.
- Playing with drop down selections.
- Just entering in sample info.
- Simple enough

#### J.D.
- Drop down, reading choices. Graduated
- Scrolls down to read other questions
- So this is just asking for high school information... Is the question just high school based? Not grad or maybe im getting too technical again. All theyre asking for is high school information? Are these real questions that would be asked int he drop down? (yes) hmm..
 - Do you feel like those could be worded differently? I would find another than discontinued. Doesnt flow, looking from common language.
 - Ok so in order to get the benefits though, wouldnt you have to be a GED grad or HS grad.
 - Asking about when you can get benefits.
- Picks different drop down options... okay that makes sense.
- Hits continue

#### J.W.

### 5 of 8 Employment History

#### E.G.
- REALLY?  You need all this?  Ugh

#### G.B.
- Entering in sample info
- Hits continue

#### J.D.
- Typing in some then deleting it. Types Legal.... number of months worked?...in the field or in this job... Why does it ask number of months as opposed to number of years? Most job applications dont refer to months. only thing that refers to months are VA form but the flow of every other thing that it relates to giving 0 to 1. Maybe make number of years instead of months. or years and months. I think at first glance, an average number of people might get confused and just write the number of years without giving it that much thought. I would relook at this question. License or rating: Types in none.
- With this employment history, if you would jsut take a normal job application, one taht is acros the board, something that they do a good job is encompassing a number of fields. In my mind looking at those going forward, a lot of them dont ask for a license or rating. Trying to look at this if an individual person filling this out to associate something they would already know.
- Hits ocntinue

#### J.W.

### 6 of 8 School Selection

#### E.G.
- I like the examples for career goals
- Date training began- should ask this at the beginning
- Don’t know what restorative training is
Vocational:  thinks it’s a certificate for like a tech program
- Can I go to school in Australia or other than US?
- Would you like to receive vocational and educational counseling?  What kind of counseling?  Online or phone? With the school or with VA?  What are you talking to me about?  Picking classes? Or is someone with VA going to help me about the financial stuff? Suggestion:  - Add bullets for options about what they want ^.

#### G.B.
- This could be an optional page, right? Could you indicate this as optional?
  - If the entire page is optional, be explicit about that? or on another page, have you attended a trade school or anything like that, a yes or no answer, add a new field to generate.
   [This page is asking where do you want to use your benefit.]
- Wait a second, that's what that one was for? I thought that was a question if I went to XYZ for this program

#### J.D.
- Reads and looks at drop down.
- Types UMR.
- Reviews each item in drop down. Is there any particular reason why it is listed in this order? I think it would make more sense to be alphabetical. in this case it woudl be the best, that it would flow better and be easier on the eyes.
- As we read and look at stuff, A comes before C.
- Scrolls back up after reading all the questions on the page.
- Chooses College, and Country, address.
- Forced to use the drop down. With the drop down bar, does it give you the opportunnity to type it in? Nope. Okay.
- Something that might save time is... a lot of times when you hit the drop down bar, this forces you to search for Missouri, as opposed to typing it in. One of those things to save time. ****  that depends on what state you live in.
- Fills out dates.
- Can you define Restorative Training off the top of your head? Restorative meaning refresher? (which?)
  - The date of training, and then the next question "are you seeking spe..."
  - Average person isn't going to know what that is. He thinks it might be voc rehab, if it is that, then it should say that. SHould be consistent in terminology with other things.
  - Fills out the rest, back to drop down. If I could just hit M and it puts me in the area, that would probably be better. Hitting M doesnt do anything.
- Hits continue

#### J.W.

### 7 of 8 Personal Information

#### E.G.
- Address. Where I am living right now when I’m setting all this up
- Why are you asking me for this? I picked email.
- You should have them choose 2 in case they enter in wrong information. Or better yet, fill out all of them.
- Address:  Where she is now or if she’s moving soon to school, do you want school address? Or if it’s an online school, what should they enter?
- Secondary contact: I expect it to populate the fields for me.
- DD:  Suggests please select one.
- She wants to put the person’s name. Especially if the student is young and the parents want the money to be transferred to their account.
- Will that direct deposit work in a foreign account
- What should she do with questions about this?

#### G.B.
- Should still be able to select all of em if they apply.
- Entering test info, relatively quickly throughout personal information

#### J.D.
- Reads question multiple times. As opposed to preferred method of contact?
 - Chooses Email. Paper takes too long, email is faster.
- Probably will ahve some people that apply in Germany, but that will probably be smaller
- If they could start to type it in and it would show what you're starting to type.
- Types in contact info
- !!! my thought process is that most people dont use email still. Wouldn't make it required information.
- Counts out the number of digits in the phone number.

- Looks this over.
- I wonder if I would get an error message (enters name and telephone number with dashes) and checks box for same address
- Hits continue

- Enters in Account number
- Enters in routing number - enter valid nine digit routing number. Has to be a real routing number.
- hits continue

#### J.W.

### 8 of 8 Review

#### E.G.
- Take off ‘application’ at top. Just have review
- I can scroll through and open. Good.
- Note:  It’s not a complete thought. Should have ‘on a government form’
- Privacy policy link opened in a new window. Confused her.

Confirmation:
- What to do if it’s longer than 30 days
- Tell them to take this form to the school certifying official in case there is a problem.
- What’s no documents required?  Confused. This tells me that I uploaded everything but I didn’t upload anything. Wasted block. Take it off.

#### G.B.
- FUnctions the same way the other one did, just scrolls up and down.

#### J.D.
- Clicks + and opens up applicant.
- Clicks + and opesn up EDU benefit
- Clicks + for Mil history
- Clicks + for Education History
- Clicks + for employment
- clicks + for school selection
- Clicks + for Personal Information
- Clicks I have read
- And Submit Application

#### J.W.
- She might specify on the applicant information page exactly where each information is being collected


### Post walkthrough questions:

#### E.G.
List stuff you need and what you don’t need
What happens if I have a warrant?  You didn’t give me a place to upload documents that show that I got it taken care of. So they might lie on the form when they see that question.


- Please imagine that you are trying to sign up for education benefits transferred to you by a spouse or parent.

  1. What parts of the process seemed confusing or required extra work?

The time frames when someone was in the military.

  2.  If you could wave a magic wand and improve three things in the application process, what would they be? What would the magically improved version be like?

Show the finished document?  Instead of sections. Would like to print the whole thing out in case I need to re-submit or take it to school officials.
Make sure the path to get to the page is easy.


#### G.B.
**1. What parts of the process seemed confusing or required extra work?**
 - EDU history vs school wanting to attend
 - Benefit types at the beginning
 - In my opinion, straightforward.

**2.  If you could wave a magic wand and improve three things in the application process, what would they be? What would the magically improved version be like?**

**3. What are the easiest parts of the process that should be kept as-is?**


- Veterans I serve are mostly in their 60s or later. None of the use the online formats for services. For claims or for MHV/eBenefits. Yesterday was the first day of showing someone how to access that to get a specific form.
-  When it comes to their age or educational barrier and getting on a computer, there is a big gap right there.
- That personally is only going to remain there if they dont get on the computer. Theyre not going to try to explore that.
- People are missing out on a lot because they feel it might be too complicated for them.
- Is that across the board or specific to the VA?
- Its across the board, not specific. I set him up with eben, first time, didnt know it existed. Doesnt have to wait to call someone and wait to call him back. can print our medications and look at his appointments.
- This is an extremely simple form to fill out.

- Had no way to get a status, normally processed in 30 days. when 35 days hits and I dont receive anything, who do I call? GI Bill number?

#### J.D.
** 1. What parts of the process seemed confusing or required extra work?**
 - Going with the state drop down, a lot of times with people with TBI and PTSD, those little things beleive it or not could trigger any frustration.
 - Date of SErvice Type. To revisit and if there was a solution to figure it out.

** 2.  If you could wave a magic wand and improve three things in the application process, what would they be? What would the magically improved version be like?**


** 3. What are the easiest parts of the process that should be kept as-is?**
-  I do like the opportunity to review it everything eneteres. and the opportunity to edit.
  - Things the example is great (re: education or career goals)


- My question is this a timed form?
- Eben form - they are timed some of it is for security reasons. I would say it is 45 minutes.
 - Good thing to have -> telling what you need up front for the form.
   In the process of starting the application. Does the time start when you first click into it?
   If they dont have that much time filling out forms. I can wing it and think about it. Especially when I get to the dates of service and like that.
   If its going to be timed and timed out during the session. If tey could save it and go back into the form and come back or will they need to start back over. One solution to that is that the iformation wasnt offered until I got in to the form. If the form was listed and these are the things you need.
    [Believes he only has a certain amount of time to fill the form out]
Worried about the time out on the form.

#### J.W.
