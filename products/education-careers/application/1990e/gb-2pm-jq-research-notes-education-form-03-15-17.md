### (Introduction)
 -  Skipped - no content in there

Have to wait for lag to catch up
### (1 of 8 Applicant Information)
  - Fills out Name and chooses II suffix
  - Fills in SSN / DOB
  - One thing maybe to indicate that it needs to be a 4 digit year, might be confusing to some

### (2 of 8 Benefit Eligibility)
  - Chooses Mont GI Bill and cont

### (3 of 8 Sponsor Veteran)
- Types in information
- When you got to this page, was anything confusing? "No not at all really"
- Types in address information
- That field may be better to be a drop down menu with all the branches of service
- Taking a minute with the check box
- Hits continue

### (4 of 8 Education History)
 - Fills in Date
 - Anything confusing? Seems pretty straightforward for me.
 - Paused on high school trainings. A little confused if I needed to put name of college or degree, had to read it a couple of times.
 - Name of college expected to be in a separate field, name of training and then name of institution
 - Type of degree? MA/BA/assoc? Which one are you looking for
 - [hovered over add another] expected that it would be for add another degree.

### (5 of 8 employment history)
 - Have youeer held, checked the box
 - Entered in Journeyman Electrician and other info
 - This all looks pretty straightforward

### (6 of 8 School Selection)
 - You're asking me now twice for college education?
 - Looks like you're asking me twice for all my college education when I first see it.
 - Didn't get that where it asks where you want to go to school.
 - Didnt read the very top, the title board when you're going through it it becomes more unneccessary noise and missing the meat where it shows transferred benefits
 - "or even something on the right hand side or a bubble with what this is about."
 - [what would you put there] I would just put a synopsis of what you're asking.
 - Enters information.
 - I think the oversight was just me, missing the first part of it.
 - [no, i dont think that was the problem - ideally we dont have people trying to figure out what the question is]
 - Some of these questions (are you getting or do you expect to get any money) starts to get convoluted, so Id ont know if its because I dont get those things that I dont know what to expect the answer should be. Maybe those getting it would understand it better.
 - To the right show examples like "pell grant, etc"
 - suggestions to show if they either did or didnt apply to them
 - More straightforward with the examples.

### (7 of 8 Personal Information)
 - Could i choose all the above (preferred contact)
 - More email and phone these days than mail
 - Enters in address

 - Trying to copy and paste email address.
 - Is that typically what you do? "Yeah, always"

 - Direct Deposit
  - This is all straightforward.
  - Those are pretty typical of any of those online submittal forms.
  - Similar to things like applying for a credit card or really anything.

### (8 of 8 Review)
 - IF I wanted to add another how easy is that, clicks edit.
  - Okay, simple enough
  - Clicks submit, gets error on " I have Read"
  - Clicks Submit after check box.


  **1. What parts of the process seemed confusing or required extra work?**
  - Probably thinking back on the dates. Trying to go back 30 years. "cuz im old I guess"
  - Biggest point is the school question felt redundant. Or why are they on different pages.
  - Do I have to go back and correct what I did, if that is really what I needed to put that.

  **2.  If you could wave a magic wand and improve three things in the application process, what would they be? What would the magically improved version be like?**
 - Mentioned: on one page in one field sction. Name of school, degree, keep that all together.
 - add in multiples on the one page.
 - Just to have the same screen for asking other educational institutional information.
 - The white space on the right ahdn side (did some web design)
   - White space would not apply. Trying to think about how you would making it mobile compliant, you're limiting how much you can tell the person from the device.
 - The one question that he stumbled on Receiving money from another US Gov. Maybe make that a little more explanatory / examples.
 - With turbotax, they explain certain things a little bit more, hover, or bubble, so you can read more about that question.
  How do you explain it without over explaining? A link, or pop up


  **3. What are the easiest parts of the process that should be kept as-is?**
- This seems as easy as applying for a credit card. This doesnt seem like its that difficult.
- eBenefits for instance: Have never submitted anything through ebenefits

- Works as a VSO. Helped a Veteran get access.



### 5490

- Please imagine that you are trying to sign up for education benefits as a spouse or child of a Veteran who is unavailable to transfer their benefits.

### (Introduction)

#### G.B.
- I like how it gives you everything you need before you start this. Thats handy
- Would there be anybody on this form to contact, once you submitted the form, how would someone be able to get a status if it was over 30 days?  See some contact information. a lot of Veterans have the waiting game to deal with some of this stuff.
- Hey it went through and someone is working on it.

- Will they get an authorization through email or anything.
  - Will they get an email or anything?  

### (1 of 8 Applicant Information)
#### G.B.
- Just breezing through now with random info

### (2 of 8 Education benefit)
#### G.B.
- Some type of pop up. That explains these two benefits.
  - I should not have to go google what CH 35 or Fry scholarship is. Have something there that tells me about each benefit
- What would the effective date be? When I start school? That's why I asked. I dont know.
- Someone starting this from scratch, how often is a dependent involved with VA. This may be a first time exposure to VA, so I guess putting the effective date of what? putting that in there. Of school? Of what? Date you are [X]

- Section 2 - Clicks none
  - Might be some place to explain. Would all dependents know what these different benefits?
  - Definitiions or some way to find out more
  - Would I know that I was receiving DIC if I was a 16 or 17 year old kid?
  - I have Veterans not even realize they are receiving or eligible for receiving benefits.
  - Unsure if its an educational barrier or terminology thing. Maybe it wasnt explained to them thoroughly. ALso questions that, how can you not know.    

### (3 of 8 Military History)

#### G.B.
- This seems simple.
- Name of Sponsor - What is that? I dont know what a Sponsor is. WOuld that be my father or mother who was deceased and getting their CH35 benefits. In parenthesis - who's the benefactor.

- Sponsor service-
  - I guess I would know if my father or mother was on active duty or not, I guess I would know the answer. Wondering if a 17 year old would know that. What is the audience going to know.
  - Simple enough for other Qs.

 - The progress bar at the top is nice to know.

### (4 of 8 Education History)
- Playing with drop down selections.
- Just entering in sample info.
- Simple enough

### (5 of 8 Employment History)
- Entering in sample info
- Hits continue

### (6 of 8 School Selection)
- This could be an optional page, right? Could you indicate this as optional?
  - If the entire page is optional, be explicit about that? or on another page, have you attended a trade school or anything like that, a yes or no answer, add a new field to generate.
   [This page is asking where do you want to use your benefit.]
- Wait a second, that's what that one was for? I thought that was a question if I went to XYZ for this program

### (7 of 8 Personal info)
- Should still be able to select all of em if they apply.
- Entering test info, relatively quickly throughout personal information

### (8 of 8 Review)
- FUnctions the same way the other one did, just scrolls up and down.

**1. What parts of the process seemed confusing or required extra work?**
 - EDU history vs school wanting to attend
 - Benefit types at the beginning
 - In my opinion, straightforward.

**2.  If you could wave a magic wand and improve three things in the application process, what would they be? What would the magically improved version be like?**

**3. What are the easiest parts of the process that should be kept as-is?**


- Veterans I serve are mostly in their 60s or later. None of the use the online formats for services. For claims or for MHV/eBenefits. Yesterday was the first day of showing someone how to access that to get a specific form.
-  When it comes to their age or educational barrier and getting on a computer, there is a big gap right there.
- That personally is only going to remain there if they dont get on the computer. Theyre not going to try to explore that.
- People are missing out on a lot because they feel it might be too complicated for them.
- Is that across the board or specific to the VA?
- Its across the board, not specific. I set him up with eben, first time, didnt know it existed. Doesnt have to wait to call someone and wait to call him back. can print our medications and look at his appointments.
- This is an extremely simple form to fill out.

- Had no way to get a status, normally processed in 30 days. when 35 days hits and I dont receive anything, who do I call? GI Bill number?
