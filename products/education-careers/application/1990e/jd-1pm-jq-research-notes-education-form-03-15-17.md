### 5490
- **Please imagine that you are trying to sign up for education benefits transferred to you by a spouse or parent.**

- My daughter uses chapter 35, that would probably something in line with what you are talking about. 


- Scrolls down, and up
- reading all the lines
- hit continue
- Did that seem clear/confusing?:  Instructions were very straightforward on the left. Liked how it was broken down as far as the one two and three and it was very clear before getting started that I needed X information, that was real good information to have. It looks very clear
- Click continue

### (1 of 8)
- Do you want me to go in and type in the information that is required?
- Enter FN, MN, LN, SSN w/DOB, scroll up, "self explanatory"
- Clicked Continue

### (2 of 8)
- Chose DEA chpt 35
- Effective date: chose Mar 13, 2016 "pretty self explanatory"
- Bars at the top tells me how far I am in the application, thats good
- Reads top of 2 of 8, prior to application hav eyou ever received. 
- Whats the reason for None being first as opposed to the bottom? Moving forward, I think kind fo like anything, like when you take standardized test, from a mindset, A B C or D or all of the above. When I see the first thing being none, I would expect none to be at the bottom because that is the way that when I look at forms, they are that way. D all of the above. Choices and then None. Being first kind of throws it off. 
- Chose Voc Rehab
- Hit continue

### (3 of 8)
- Military History: Reads line. Clicks spouse or surviving spouse, reads questions. Chooses no for divorce/annul. Chooses no for did you get remarried. 
  - Do the names for things make sense to you?  What is your relationship to the SM... lmt for one second: I tink that flows, makes sense and then moving forward from a SM point of view... self explanatory... SRP for updating medical records, when we review before or after deployment. We get asked those questions often when we do our SGLI for insurance. I think that portion at the very top, that flows. 
   - Reads other two questions: That makes sense
   - How bout the word Sponsor:  Sponsor makes perfect sense, a lot of times active duty retirees, everyting is ran and generated off of our ssn. If my wife calls tricare and sets up an appt, and its all set up under my SSN. THey track it from DEERS that its under his SSN so they always ask for the sponsor or Servicemember. Most verbage is usually the sponsor. 
- Scrolls down, goes through each question and tries to hit continue. Gets red response. 
 - Were you surprised that those were required? No not at all.  A lot of times I guess they are required because of DEERS, thats not uncommon. When Im a SM when we go to update the ID part, those are normal questions that we'd be asked and that would be something that the system that verfieis our family, that does make sense. 
 - In context of the form: were you surprised to get na error: No, when it turned red, no, I think that is something now a days that a majority of people that if its not filled out that you cant proceed and move forward. 
 - Types in SSN. Unsure if should use same Social as last time. Most systems that ill come across. AFter I type in the first three, the dash would appear after the first three itself. Or when you type in the number that it would just read straight 9 digits all by itself without any dashes. Left it unclear. When its not clear and you go and type everything in and you push cotinue, it can be a little frustrating sometimes even though it is something that simple. 
  - Enters DOB. 
  - Enters Date of death and hits continue. 
 - **Section 2**
- Branch of service. Types US Army and clicks no for active duty 
- Reads questions outloud. 
-  Re-reads the 
 ***Instead of saying account, on whose benefit you're claiming (the word account just seems off to me).***
-  I would imagine that some of the soldiers that fill out this form, that they would have some kind of PTSD and are dpenedent on what we've seen during our service. Some of thsoe things can be a bit agitating. 
  -  [You were talking about PTSD: Was that about the wording of a question or if the question was being clear?] "That goes back to the use of the word account as opposed to benefit. Just those small things like that, from my perspective that if i have to sit and figure out how to decipher, if I have to give it a whole lot of thought, it can be frustrating. 
 -   On this page with Military History
  -  Have you ever served on active duty. ASking person that is filling this out right?  (correct)
  - Enters Army, reads each section outloud. 
   - (Entering information to fill out the most information - hitting yes to go through that)
  
- When you say start of service period and end of service period. We normally look at enlistment (start of enlistment) and end of enlistment. As opposed to, i understand service, but when you say service you might have people that start on NG or reserve. Some go NG to Res and some go NG/Res. That could be conflicting if they have multiple kinds of service. 
- IF you have both how do yo uthink you would do that within this form. You would almost ahve to prompt another question in there. have you ever service in active duty and if so, National Guard or ACtive Duty. A question along those lines would have to be asked. when you say Service 
- Trying to figure out my exact thought process. When I see service I think enlistment period. 
- Fills it out. 
- Step 3 - Applicant Service
  - Now I kind of understand, when I was saying NG or Reserve? When I was saying SErvice. Now Im seeing the Add another. Iw oudl think there has to be another way, to simplify this without having to add services. You may have some people that will come in as a NG, and then come off and then join active duty. They may have 3 or 4 breaks in service. I undertsand why now the word service is used as opposed to enlist. I dont know I just know that as far as filling out forms but there amy not be a reasonf or this. having all those different breaks of service it is the responsibility of the SM who had those dates, the problem you will run into is what if the family member doesnt have all those date. The form is for mia, kia, if they were themselves a SM it would be easier. Because ti is geared towards a family member, it could be challening if they dont have the dd214 in front of them.

 - (3 of 8 - Contributions)
- Reads question
- I guess with that, clicks Yes. To see what the question is. 
- So when you say benefits, hmm, do you mean pay or... or other government assistant programs. (What do you think?) My thought process, well with this form it pertains to education, so the question you are asking if theyre receiving benefits. It doesnt seem that it is clear as to what type of benefits, health? education? or some other type of benefit? 
- That would be hard in some people's cases, that would be hard to... that is kind of a complex.. maybe there is another way to reask that question. 
- Hits continue
### (4 of 8 - edu history)
- Drop down, reading choices. Graduated
- Scrolls down to read other questions
- So this is just asking for high school information... Is the question just high school based? Not grad or maybe im getting too technical again. All theyre asking for is high school information? Are these real questions that would be asked int he drop down? (yes) hmm..
 - Do you feel like those could be worded differently? I would find another than discontinued. Doesnt flow, looking from common language.
 - Ok so in order to get the benefits though, wouldnt you have to be a GED grad or HS grad. 
 - Asking about when you can get benefits. 
- Picks different drop down options... okay that makes sense. 
- Hits continue
### (5 of 8 - Empl hist)
- Typing in some then deleting it. Types Legal.... number of months worked?...in the field or in this job... Why does it ask number of months as opposed to number of years? Most job applications dont refer to months. only thing that refers to months are VA form but the flow of every other thing that it relates to giving 0 to 1. Maybe make number of years instead of months. or years and months. I think at first glance, an average number of people might get confused and just write the number of years without giving it that much thought. I would relook at this question. License or rating: Types in none. 
- With this employment history, if you would jsut take a normal job application, one taht is acros the board, something that they do a good job is encompassing a number of fields. In my mind looking at those going forward, a lot of them dont ask for a license or rating. Trying to look at this if an individual person filling this out to associate something they would already know. 
- Hits ocntinue
### (6 of 8 - School selection)
- Reads and looks at drop down. 
- Types UMR. 
- Reviews each item in drop down. Is there any particular reason why it is listed in this order? I think it would make more sense to be alphabetical. in this case it woudl be the best, that it would flow better and be easier on the eyes. 
- As we read and look at stuff, A comes before C. 
- Scrolls back up after reading all the questions on the page. 
- Chooses College, and Country, address. 
- Forced to use the drop down. With the drop down bar, does it give you the opportunnity to type it in? Nope. Okay. 
- Something that might save time is... a lot of times when you hit the drop down bar, this forces you to search for Missouri, as opposed to typing it in. One of those things to save time. ****  that depends on what state you live in. 
- Fills out dates. 
- Can you define Restorative Training off the top of your head? Restorative meaning refresher? (which?)
  - The date of training, and then the next question "are you seeking spe..." 
  - Average person isn't going to know what that is. He thinks it might be voc rehab, if it is that, then it should say that. SHould be consistent in terminology with other things. 
  - Fills out the rest, back to drop down. If I could just hit M and it puts me in the area, that would probably be better. Hitting M doesnt do anything. 
- Hits continue
### (7 of 8 personal info)
- Reads question multiple times. As opposed to preferred method of contact?
 - Chooses Email. Paper takes too long, email is faster. 
- Probably will ahve some people that apply in Germany, but that will probably be smaller
- If they could start to type it in and it would show what you're starting to type. 
- Types in contact info
- !!! my thought process is that most people dont use email still. Wouldn't make it required information. 
- Counts out the number of digits in the phone number. 
### (7 of 8 - personal info - sec contact)
- Looks this over. 
- I wonder if I would get an error message (enters name and telephone number with dashes) and checks box for same address
- Hits continue
### (7 of 8 - DD/eft)
- Enters in Account number
- Enters in routing number - enter valid nine digit routing number. Has to be a real routing number. 
- hits continue

 ** 1. What parts of the process seemed confusing or required extra work?**
  - Going with the state drop down, a lot of times with people with TBI and PTSD, those little things beleive it or not could trigger any frustration. 
  - Date of SErvice Type. To revisit and if there was a solution to figure it out. 
  
 ** 2.  If you could wave a magic wand and improve three things in the application process, what would they be? What would the magically improved version be like?**
     
  
 ** 3. What are the easiest parts of the process that should be kept as-is?**
 -  I do like the opportunity to review it everything eneteres. and the opportunity to edit. 
   - Things the example is great (re: education or career goals)
   
   
 - My question is this a timed form?
 - Eben form - they are timed some of it is for security reasons. I would say it is 45 minutes. 
  - Good thing to have -> telling what you need up front for the form. 
    In the process of starting the application. Does the time start when you first click into it? 
    If they dont have that much time filling out forms. I can wing it and think about it. Especially when I get to the dates of service and like that.
    If its going to be timed and timed out during the session. If tey could save it and go back into the form and come back or will they need to start back over. One solution to that is that the iformation wasnt offered until I got in to the form. If the form was listed and these are the things you need. 
     [Believes he only has a certain amount of time to fill the form out]
Worried about the time out on the form.
