# Multiform approach to education forms

Education benefits is unusual in that it has several very similar forms that vary slightly by who is applying for the benefit and whether it is a new application for a benefit or a modification, such as moving the benefit to a new school.

## Challenge

Present a clear a low stress way to get applicants to the correct form.

- Too much information can make it harder to find the correct answer
- We want to avoid making assumptions not visible to the applicant
- Some applicants are arriving with incorrect advice and filling out the wrong form. For example, we have a statistically improbable number of 1990N forms filled out each year. Most of these applicants then need to start over and fill out the correct form.



## Veteran feedback

In most cases when we bumped into a point of confusion, the Veterans asked some version of “Couldn't this be like TurboTax, where you help me figure it out?”

Usability sessions with the proposed solution have been positive and we have observed Veterans quickly and painlessly selecting the correct form when presented with different scenarios.

We have heard no complaints about the additional questions



## Solution

We worked with stakeholders to map out questions that we could ask to reliably point applicants to the correct form. We call this the multiform approach (sometimes wizard) and the idea is to provide a single “Apply now” button that asks a few questions to determine which application they need.

We have done two rounds or usability testing on this, one late last year on an early prototype, and another in the last couple weeks. Both provided consistent positive feedback about the approach, and furnished helpful suggestions to further clarify the way we asked the questions.

This provides valuable help to applicants who are unsure, and reassurance to applicants who have gotten advice about which form to use.



### How it works

- On the apply page, everyone goes through this multiform flow. 
- If they search for a specific form number on vets.gov the results will list a direct link to that form as the first entry.
- The forms are directly linkable from any place that that makes sense. For example, the content page for the Fry Scholarship could link directly to the 5490. Direct links to the forms could be emailed to any stakeholders.
