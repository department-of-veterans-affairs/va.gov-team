# 1995 form
Discovery for the 1995 form largely lives here, but there are a few multi-form resources that are also relevant.

## [1995-outline.md](1995-outline.md)
This is a markdown outline of the questions we need to ask for the 1995 path.

## [1990-1995-comparison.xlsx](1990-1995-comparison.xlsx)
This spreadsheet compares the 1995 (move benefit) inputs with what we’ve already built for the 1990 (apply for benefits). The idea is to see how much new work there is to make the front-end for this path. We’re also looking to standardize the way that we ask the same question on different paths.

## [Paper-VBA-22-1995.pdf](Paper-VBA-22-1995.pdf)
The "paper" version of this form. Edu forms are 90% online, but the paper 1995 is much more recently updated than the VONAPP and is a better reference.
