# Form 22-1995 Research Brief

## Goal and Research Questions
### Goal
Check for any points of confusion or errors of fact in the 1995 form.

### Key research questions
1. Was the applicant able to complete the form successfully on their own?
2. Was there anything in the form that they found confusing?

### Details
- Proposed dates: Thursday or Friday the Week of Jan 23rd, or early the week after
- Is this tied to a deadline? Yes
- What are we evaluating (if formative research, just note "nothing yet!")? Live code.

### Recruitment
- Who is the target audience?
  - Recent users of Education Benefits. This form is used to change where your existing Education Benefit is being applied. For example, _I have been taking night courses for a year, but I have a new assignment across the country. I want to move my benefit to a nearby college._

- 3-5 participants (and I think 3 is sufficient)
