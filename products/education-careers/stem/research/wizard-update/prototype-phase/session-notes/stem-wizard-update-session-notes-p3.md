### Findings
Scenario 1b - let VA know you're studying Biochemistry
* [While attempting to change major,] "Are you applying for the Rogers STEM Scholarship? I guess I would say' yes'"
* User answered all questions for STEM without question.
* After reading the blue box warning "When you are closer to exhausting your benefits you may apply", immediately clicked "Continue" button which would submit an ineligible application. Completely disregarded the blue warning.

Scenario 2a - Apply for STEM Scholarship - Science major with 2 years of Post-9/11 benefit left
* Eventually found stem scholarship.
* Said "eligibility blab, blab, blah" for eligibility requirements on the wizard rather than reading each word.
* Blue box appeared and users immediate clicked Continue button again submitting an ineligible application.
* [Did you notice the blue box?] "That's the only thing that's confusing. Would I even have access to the scholarship?"
* "Well, my thing is always like, try and see what happens." 

2b scenario. -History major 2 yrs of benefit let
* Read instructions thoroughly, then said yes to both applying and enrolled in science - even though she knows what stem means - "Oh shoot, I'm sorry. I'm not sure why - No, I would not be applying because I'm not that major, I'm not studying that.  
* Changed answer to no, as she was just one question away from the top question. Then continued to the Military history page. 
* "They are still asking me questions even though I didn't apply, so they are still collecting data."
* "Now it says you may not be eligible." Okay, that's what I was waiting for…In the other scenario…I was expecting…after you did a couple a prompts where technically you didn't corollate with the eligibility standards, it would have given me a prompt and said you weren't eligible for it and it would stop there." 
* Wizard text - "I think most people will read the bold stuff.  Technically somebody should read it, but with veterans they like to skip stuff, they look at the bold stuff and go to the next prompt 
* "Even though [the eligibility bullets] specific technically what you would need to even apply for the scholarship. I think it needs to be there."
* Thoughts on top of STEM page - pause, yeah, anything more would be too wordy - also you have this part, learn more
* Blue box reactions - I think it's important it give you a mini - it's like cliff notes an explanation
* No, I wouldn’t consider them continuing through the process if they are not aiming to go get a STEM degree or studying STEM at all unless they made a mistake.
* Thoughts on warning? If I saw this message, I'd technically stop even going forward with applying because I know that I'm not even eligible for it. But then you have another user that's going to continue clicking Continue to see what else happens. 
* "If it stops there and it says you're not eligible, it shouldn’t even allow you to move forward at all…I think it would send you directly back to the home page or whatever….something like, 'Thank you, but due to your [answers] you're not eligible.'"
* "If it says you're not eligible it would never be submitted." 
* "Continue indicates that there are more prompts left. Until we see the final thing that says submit, then you'll technically know that it's submitted."
* "I don't think that they should let you [submit if you are not eligible]. If it doesn't meet the criteria, they shouldn't even allow you to submit the application. They can send some sort of rejection letter stating why it's rejected, if it even follows through, but I think it should stop you right there.  That saves paperwork and time."
* "It was a pleasure and an honor to go through this focus group with you and I hope it becomes a success."
