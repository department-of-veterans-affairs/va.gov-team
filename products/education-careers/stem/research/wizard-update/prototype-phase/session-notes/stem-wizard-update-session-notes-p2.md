* Have 32 months left on Voc RehabHave 2 

Scenario 1A
* VocRehab is not in the list of benefits
* Would do learn more
* Clicked "No" to bypass Stem app
* Wondered if VA Ben is part of us government - I would say no
* Pretty simple
* The question about va gov benefit to me was kindo of confusing because voc rehab is a gov benefits. Every thing else was straight forward.

History Major with 2 years left scenario
* Selected 3rd radio button
* Read 1st bullet in copy, skipped the rest and decided to apply (missing STEM part in wizard)
* Opened the Learn More
* Selected yes, even though we said history
* Selected no, to 6 months remaining, Blue box appeared.
* "[The blue box] is telling me that since I'm not within 6 months or exhausted all my benefit that I can't apply for the scholarship right now."
* Would click Continue and submit ineligible application and continue answering unnecessary questions.
* At the end I could have clicked finish later…but it was kinda confusing, because they had "Continue" instead."
* "If it told me I wasn't eligible, I would just think that it would have finish this application later or something else to end the application."
* Expectation: "It would have taken me back to the page that asked about my educational benefit - the page we started from."
* "When seeing continue, you would think it will take me somewhere else…
* "If it's not going to allow me to go further, I'd expect it to take me back to the beginning to do something else."

English major with 2 years left scenario
* Would again click learn more - reads science, tech, eng and math so at this time I'd say to applying for the scholarship
* If they said yes and clicked continue, something should pop-up and tell [ask] them are you a stem [student] …getting a math or engineering degree or science degree ?
* Reads blue box re stem degree or TC, then the next question continuously.
* 23:36 - uses new question successfully.
* Reads caution message in full. Then reads the new question and says "I would say no because [of] the 6 months remaining [requirement].
* Clicks "No" in the new question 
* [Turns out the learn more was still expanded, so it took a bit more time to orient - just 18 seconds]. "Okay, it takes me back to where I was."24:22 - 23:40 
* Was comfortable with No being selected and would click continue [Would click Continue and submit ineligible application and contine answering unnecessary questions.]  

Copy   
* Thought the Wizard copy was good.  "It could save you time.  You could click yes or no [in the wizard] to save time based on where you are with your benefit."
* [static copy for "Do you want to apply" question 29:14]  "I don’t think it is enough. But if you want to learn more you have the drop down arrow…that's good enough."
* [blue boxes] real good information - that person knows by the info in the blue box what the stem scholarship is for and that they may be eligible or may not be eli"
* [Caution box] that will let me know based on what I clicked that I would not possibly be elf for the program - 
* Expectation: "By my responses that I clicked on, I would think [the caution alert] would tell be that I'm not eligible. Cause I don’t see why I would be." 31:00
* "It's giving them false hope by saying "you may not be eligible'. You might try to find another way to get into the program and you may waste a lot of time."
* User expects to be told they are not eligible if they do not qualify.
* Remembered that you could learn more about stem programs by reading the learn more.
* "No, I wouldn't" [apply if I didn't meet the requirements].
* If it said "you may be eligible" I might still be trying, but I would expect a different response.  
* If it said you "may" be eligible, I would be trying to look for a way to get in.
* Likes that you could click on "Check your Post-9/11 Gi Bill status" <--t: Change to check your remaining benefit?
* Does not think the application would be submit because they have more than 6 months remaining.  "No I wouldn't think so because they have more than six months remaining. It should tell me that I'm no longer being considered for this scholarship and take me back to the first page."
* I thought everything was pretty much simple except for a few things I've already explained.
