### Participant Info
* BA in accounting, pursuing a masters in finance

### Findings
* Liked that eligibility criteria is presented so you can determine whether you qualify.  
* Did not noticed that she didn’t qualify while using the wizard.  
* Liked having the ability to check remaining benefits.  
* Liked that you could learn more about the scholarship and would visit the page.  
* Thought it was odd that the STEM question appeared when changing schools "What is this? Do I have to answer now?"  
* Thought it was odd that you could apply for stem on the 1995.  
* Used the "Learn more about scholarship eligibility" link.  
* Answered yes to "Are you enrolled in an undergraduate STEM degree program?" even though she has already graduated.  
* Enhancement: have a link to view eligible STEM programs (Wondered if accounting was considered math).  
* Upon reading the blue box about "pursuing an undergraduate STEM degree", realized she wouldn't qualify as she already has already graduated.  
* Wished we'd mentioned "undergraduate" up-front in the requirements. "You might have led with that".  
* Would select the Blue "Continue" button after the warning button (app would be processed).  
* Assumed the VA would not prevent her from continue if she were ineligible so the VA did not have to process extra applications.  
* Was confused by the continue button when ineligible.  Assumed it would stop the application.  
* Thought the Continue button might take you back or show a landing page. What else can I do.  
* Eventually noticed the back top link.  
* "Expected [the Continue button] to stop me. Not let me continue."  
* Assumed you could apply for stem and change your program or place of training simultaneously.
