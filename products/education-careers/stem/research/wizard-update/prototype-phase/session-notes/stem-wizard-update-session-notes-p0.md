### Findings
* Clicked Continue button without seeing the back to top link, submitting an ineligible app to buffalo.
* [After the change schools process, when asked about seeing the STEM scholarship question] "It seemed pretty straightforward. It kind of stops you and asks you the question before you even go into the application."
* "I would stop and read the Learn more about scholarship eligibility to see what this is about."
* Was able to determine eligibility based on the Learn more content. "Since I'm only halfway through the program [scenario 1b], I don't think I would be eligible, so I would click 'no'." 6:20 2nd time through app
* "To be honest with you, at this point I would just stop filling out the application. I wouldn't even finish…I would go to YouTube.com or something." 
* "I wasn't sure if I even qualified for it, so it was just like a shot in the dark, hoping I'd qualify.
* [When on the wizard] "I'm within 6 months and was thinking I would qualify at this point"
* Assumed you had to meet all 3 eligibility requirements to be eligible.
* The most important one being the one at the bottom. That's the one I focused on."
* Suggestion for copy: "You could say all 3 are required."
* To be honest with you, my eyes when straight to within 6 months of using up your education benefit. I didn’t pay attention to the first two.
* After the first warning 'you do not meet the criteria' and then the final…'Hey, you're pretty much wasting your time here.' Then I was like, I don't qualify. I wouldn't want to continue and then it started going into filling out your school. I thought that would be a waste of time. It should automatically end the application at that point. " "Once you read this message and hit "Continue" you should be taken back to another message or taken to the beginning and you could apply for another benefit."   
* Suggestion: [After they indicated that they do not want to submit the application] "Include in the message stuff you may qualify for, or if you'd like to apply for something else, go there."
* When they start to asking you to enter school addresses and stuff like that it's a little confusing…Am I still eligible? Why is it continuing? It's a little confusing there. Well, maybe there is still a chance. It's clear to me that I do not qualify for it. It gets confusing when I hit continue and it starts asking me more information."
* "It says you 'may' not be eligible, now that I think about it, I did not read the big "You may not be eligible" so now you hit continue and think there is still a chance. But there is no chance, right?...The "You may" still gives me hope."
* If you didn’t wanted to apply would you think about changing your response at the top of the page?  The only way I'd get past this wall here is to lie and eventually they would find out. I honest think there would be no other chance after this [final warning]. 
* I'm thinking it would have [submitted my stem application when I changed school]."
* "With these government programs, sometimes you qualify and sometimes you don't. Being towards the end of my degree, I already know there maybe a chance I don’t qualify for this program. So when you go through and see 'may not' qualify , I'm thinking there may be a chance and I would just submit and wait for my response. 
* [The blue box message] seems like a casual message, but that one is evil. That one sticks out like, Hey, you may not be eligible…This means business, you know."
* Did not notice the last sentence in the gray warning box. "I read stuff, I get bored, I leave"
* I read the blue one because it pops up out of no where, but when you get the danger sign you know this is important.
* Expects that if you click no, all those other questions would disappear.
