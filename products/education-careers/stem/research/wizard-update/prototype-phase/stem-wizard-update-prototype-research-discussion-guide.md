# STEM Scholarship: Education Routing Wizard & VA Form 22-1995 Update - Prototype Research Discussion Guide 

## Introduction 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME]. I also have several colleagues on the line.  They’ll be observing and taking notes to ensure that we capture your feedback accurately. 

We work with a team at the VA that designs online forms. 

Today, we'll be looking at a form that students use to update their educational benefits.

We're reviewing the form with students in sessions like this to ensure that it's easy to use.

The entire session should take less than 45 minutes.

Throughout the process, we are interested in hearing your honest opinions. We are in no way testing your knowledge or ability. We just want to hear your ideas and be sure the form meets Veterans’ needs. 
You are welcome to express any opinions you wish. We welcome your feedback.

If for any reason you want to pause or stop the session, please let me know. I'd be happy to do so.

Do you have any questions before we get started?

**Recording**

We generally record sessions, in case we need to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. 
Are you comfortable if I record the audio and screen movements as we talk? 

Great! I'm going to turn the recording on now.  
Once it starts, I’ll ask again if you are okay if we record, so we have your verbal consent.

[The meeting host will begin audio and screen recording.][When we hear an announcement that it’s started,] 

Are you comfortable if I record the audio and screen movements today? Thank you. 

**Warm-up Questions**

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions 

1.	Which Education benefits have you used (Post-9/11, Montgomery, etc.)?

2.	What type of degree are you pursuing?

3.	How far through the program are you?

4.  Approximately how many months or years of education benefit do you have remaining?

5.	[If STEM] Do you have any interest in obtaining a teaching certification after you graduate?


**Prototype**

Now we're going to shift gears and review a clickable prototype that we’d like to get your feedback on. 

Just so you know, the prototype is a mock-up, rather than a real website.  This means only certain links have been activated and you’ll see pretend data in some areas. In many cases, as soon as you click you'll see an example of what someone might type in the fields.  We do this to save you time and eliminate the need to type.


**Think Aloud**

While you are going through the site, we ask that you please think aloud and vocalize your thoughts, and decisions. 
We are interested in your first reaction to each page.  
The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn.  
Thinking aloud may seem strange at first, but it helps us understand what aspects of the design work well and where we might want to make improvements to make things even easier.
If you have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free to ask them along the way.

**General Questions**

Now I'm going to ask a number of questions that relate to the scholarship application process.

1. What are your thoughts on the overall process of applying for the STEM Scholarship?

**Wizard Questions**  
Let's go back to the beginning of the process, so I can ask a few specific questions.  
1. As you look at the information that appears when you click the STEM Scholarship option, what thoughts or reactions come to mind?
2. What additional information would help you determine whether or not to apply for the scholarship?
3. What are your thoughts on whether you’d be eligible for this scholarship?
4. [If there seems to be confusion] How might we further clarify the eligibility requirements? 
5. [If they’re ineligible] Under what circumstances might you try to apply for this scholarship even though you don’t seem to be eligible?


**VA Form 22-1995 Questions**  
Now, let's look at the application form.  
1. What did you think of the part of the process when you were answering the questions about the Rogers STEM Scholarship?
2. As you read through the eligibility requirements, what questions come to mind?
3. What are your thoughts on whether you’re eligible for the Rogers STEM Scholarship?  
    * What information are you using to form that decision?
    * Are you able to determine under what circumstances you might become eligible in the future?
    * Would you go ahead with the application if you thought you were close to exhaustion?
    * How effectively does the form inform you of your potential eligibility?
4. What are your thoughts on these blue boxes? 
5. [ When looking at the last info / alert ] When you saw this, what did you think your options were at this point in the process?” 
6. Do you have the impression that your application will be processed or not processed?
