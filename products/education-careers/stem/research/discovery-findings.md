## STEM Discovery ##

To kick off STEM discovery, the UX team checked out research & analytics for 22-1995, as that's the form that STEM is cohabitating with at the present.  Below are findings from the exploration of 22-1995 analytics and past DSVA research on that form.

### VA Form 22-1995 Research from 2017 ###

Ad Hoc conducted research  on the 1995 with 3 participants in 2017

#### Veteran Information
*	Questions with examples fare better. (i.e., On the "why did you stop...." suggests: you might add some parenthetical info: "e.g. moving your residence.")
*	knows the VA  has all the info anyway so is comfortable giving it. “That’s the thing about the military; our information is already there.”

#### Benefit Information
*	It would be nice if the system were intelligent enough to be able to know what [Benefit] he was using

#### School Information
*	Old School "What if I'm still there taking classes, just getting ready for the move?" Q from mod: "What would you do in that scenario?" "I guess I'd pre-date it." Puts date in the future.
*	Got a little stuck on what the "address" was for on the school selection page: the school's address or his?
	 “Since it says ‘personal information’ I would probably say ‘home address,’ if that’s the desired outcome.” 
*	If he didn’t have the school address memorized, would go to Google and get the address. 
*	“It doesn’t seem like it’s set up [for people who aren’t currently in school and want to restart benefits.]”
	Old School When did you stop taking classes: “I wonder if they want the quarter, month, date?” [this is an existing error in the form; should be a date field]
*	“Why did you stop taking classes…”: “This question is phrased as though I’m not continuing…this wording is negative…it could even be ‘or have you graduated’….” Has no other suggestions for wording.
*	“I didn’t stop; I finished!”
*	Other benefits questions are still somewhat confusing
*	What address are you asking for? Losing context of headline after scroll. 
*	Examples can reduce anxiety

#### Contact Details  
*	Would enter the same phone number for primary and mobile phone — “my cell is my primary.”
Direct Deposit
*	Only show account and routing information if they're indiciating "start" for using direct deposit
*	 "I'd be continuing [to use direct deposit]. It's sad that I have to put it in and tell what kind of account if I'm continuing."
*	Hesitates on direct deposit — “is there another option? for this scenario I’m already receiving benefits…my direct deposit would already be set up. Do I need to update it, or is it the same?” Q: How would you like it to work? A: “I’d like to start it or stop it, update makes sense if I were changing banks. For me personally, I don’t need to do any of those, so I’d like a ‘no change’ option, so I don’t have to go through and re-enter [the same information] that’s on file.”
*	Likes form validation on the routing number
*	On direct deposit: “Do I have to click one of these? I want to continue using the same method I’m already using…there’s no option to continue using my current method.” Fills out nothing and wants to click on continue, which works at the moment.

#### Review
*	"You might also have an expand all button. Again someone with a disability like mine...I have to go through and click all of these, and sometimes it's hard to aim, particularly if you're someone with a mobility impairment and you're using a pointing device or a mouth stick." Does not use an assistive device, but uses StickyKeys on the Mac.
