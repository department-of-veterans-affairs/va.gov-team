# GIBCT Colmery Act Sec 116 Veteran Discussion Script
*June 3, 2019*

### Welcome and Opening Remarks (5 minutes)
*[When the participant is ready, the moderator will begin the session with the following introduction.]*

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [name], and I also have two colleagues on the line, Amy and Cindy.  They are observing and taking notes. We work with a team at the VA that is enhancing a website called VA.gov and we're interested in speaking with you today about a pilot program called VET TEC. VET TEC is a tuition assistance program designed to help Veterans advance in IT careers by enrolling in high-tech training programs.  The team has expanded the existing GI Bill comparison tool on VA.gov to allow Veterans to compare VET TEC programs.

We’d like your thoughts on what aspects of the pages work well and where we might make improvements to make things even easier for Veterans.

Before we start, I’d like to mention a few logistical details:

*  We are interested in hearing your honest opinions. We are in no way testing your knowledge or ability. Our goal is to be sure that application meets Veterans’ needs, so we are interested in hearing your thoughts and ideas. You are welcome to express any opinions you wish. We welcome your feedback.
*  If for any reason you want to pause or stop the session at any time, just let me know. I'd be happy to do so.
*  By testing the site thoroughly, we hope to ensure that it’s written in a thoughtful way and gives Veterans all of the information they need to make informed decisions.
*  Do you have any questions so far? 
*  Lastly, we generally record sessions, in case we need to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. 

Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today? 

Great! I'm going to turn on screen and audio recording now.  Once it's on, I'll ask again, as we like to have your verbal consent

[The meeting host will begin audio and screen recording.]

Are you comfortable if we record the audio and screen movements today? 

### Warm-up Questions (5 minutes)
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.  

1. As you think about training programs you might take to enhance your career:
	* What factors would be most important to you as you research training providers and programs?
	* What factors would lead you to choose one training provider over another?
	* What factors would lead you to choose one course over another?
2. Have you considered a career in the high-tech industry? 
3. Have you used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before? If yes, what was your experience?


Okay, now we're going to look at the va.gov website and walk through a few scenarios.

#### Think Aloud
While you are going through the site, we ask that you please think aloud and vocalize your thoughts and decisions. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn.  We are interested in your first reaction to each page, as well as what you are thinking as you engage with each page.   If you have questions about what information needs to go in a particular field, it’s likely that many other Veterans will too. Sharing your thoughts aloud may seem strange at first, but it helps us understand what you are thinking and helps us so much with our work.



### Scenario #1 (10 minutes)
Using the GI Bill Comparison Tool, how would you explore training opportunities in Detroit, Michagan?

Please talk aloud and let us know what you are thinking as you explore the site.

*[After the particpant has explored the site and shared thoughts aloud.]*

1. What are your first impressions?  
2. What information on these pages is the most important to you?
3. What is confusing or unclear? Why?  	
4. How trustworthy and reliable do you consider this information to be?



### Scenario #2 (10 minutes)

Let say you're interested in takig an online course in the evenings. Using the site, how would you find 2 online courses and decide which best suits your needs?

*[After the particpant has explored the prototype and shared thoughts aloud.]*

### Section 501 Follow up questions 

1. What are your thoughts on the contents of the gray box on the right?
2. What are your thoughts on the questions on the left? How they might be useful? 
3. What are your thoughts on receiving an estimate vs. an exact amount for your housing allowance?
4. What are your thought on the 2nd to last question on the left ("Did you use your Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit before January 1, 2018?")?
	
### Section 107 Follow up questions

1. If the training provider offered courses in multiple cities, would you expect the housing allowance to be the same or different for each city?
2. How would you decide which location you'd like to attend?
3. What are your thoughts on the last question on the left ("Will the majority of your classes be on the main campus?")?
4. Let's look at the results page for a moment.  As you think about large nationwide training providers like ..., would you expect to see one card for each provider or one for each city where training is offered?


### Post-Task Interview (5 minutes)
Now that you’ve had a chance to explore the site, I’m going to ask you a few final questions. Some of these questions I’ve already asked you, but I want to ask them again, now that you’ve seen the website.  

*  What do you like most about this website? 
*  What enhancements or features would you recommend to improve the overall usefulness of this site? 
*  Would you use this website in real life? Why or why not?
*  Would you recommend this tool to your friends? Why or why not?
*  On a scale of 1-5 with 5 being the highest, how would you rate the tool's ability to give you the information you need to make a decision on which program to attend?
*  On a scale of 1-5 with 5 being the highest, how likely are you to use a tool like this?
*  Assuming you had access to all three, would you prefer to view a site like the comparison tool using a desktop, tablet or mobile? 
*  Do you have any additional thoughts or comments you'd like to share?


### Thank-You and Closing
*[The moderator concludes each session by thanking the participant for their time and for offering his/her opinions and suggestions.]*
