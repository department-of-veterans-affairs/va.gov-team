# STEM Usability Testing Discussion Guide 

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Amy and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to take a look at the application for a new scholarship for Post-9/11 GI Bill beneficiaries.  

Before we get started, a few things I want to mention:
- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I don't want to keep you much longer than that, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- During this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We're not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I won't be offended by any opinions you express and welcome your feedback.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

We will be working in a prototype so some functionality may not work as expected. You may click on something and nothing may happen.  In those cases, I'll let you know that the functionality isn't working and ask what you would expect to happen.

Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are deleted after we finish analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

  - If yes: Great - thank you.  Once I start recording, I'll ask again so we have your audible confirmation.
  - If no: Ok. My team will just observe and take notes as we go. 

Start recording.
- 	I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?


## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1.	Are you currently using or have you ever used your GI Bill education benefits?
- (If applicable) Where are you going to school?  What are you getting a degree in?
2. Are you familiar with the Rogers STEM scholarship?
 - If yes, what have you heard?


For our session today, I'm going to give you a couple tasks to do online. While you're going through them, it would be really helpful if you'd think aloud - kind of like you'd do if you were talking to yourself. We are interested in your first reactions, what you're thinking & wondering as you go through the process. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn.

When you think aloud, it helps us understand what works well and where we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free to ask them along the way.

I'm going to give you control of my screen & mouse. I'll pass control to you and you should receive a message that prompts you to control the screen. 

## First Task: Determine Eligibility - 15 minutes

You've heard about a scholarship that the VA offers called the Rogers STEM scholarship and are curious if you could receive this scholarship while going to school. How would you use this form to determine if you were eligible for the Rogers STEM scholarship?

Things to watch for:
- Does the user look at the subway map?
- Where does the user look to determine eligibility?
- Does the user read to determine eligibility or just start the application?

**Upon completion of task:** 
- What do you think the requirements are to be eligible for the STEM scholarship?
  - STEM program of study / credit hours
  - 6 months or less of benefit left
  - Using Post 9/11 benefits
- What did you think of how the requirements were communicated?
- If you were unsure if your degree qualified for STEM, what would you do?
- (If applicable) How do you keep track of how much of your benefit you have left?
- Would you expect to be eligible for this scholarship?
- In terms of determining the requirements for this scholarship, on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very hard and 5 is very easy, how would you rate this task?

## Second Task: Apply for STEM (Eligible participants ONLY) - 15 minutes

Let's say you wanted to apply for the STEM scholarship. How would you go about filling out this application?
  
  Things to watch for:
  -	Do any questions cause confusion or require additional research for users to answer?
  - Does the user try to skip any questions?
  - Does the user click the Additional Info component "What if I don't have a bank account?"?
  - If ineligible, how does the user react to ineligibility alert?
  
  Upon completion of the task:
  - In terms of applying for this scholarship, on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very hard and 5 is very easy, how would you rate this task?

## Second Task: Apply for STEM (Non-eligible participants ONLY) - 15 minutes

Let's say you are currently getting your undergraduate degree in Chemistry from Florida State University and would like to apply for the Rogers STEM scholarship.  How would you go about filling out this application?
  
  Things to watch for:
  -	Do any questions cause confusion or require additional research for users to answer?
  - Does the user try to skip any questions?
  - Does the user click the Additional Info component "What if I don't have a bank account?"?
  
  Upon completion of the task:
  - In terms of applying for this scholarship, on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very hard and 5 is very easy, how would you rate this task?
  
## Alternate Second Task (Non-eligible participants ONLY): Not Exhausted Benefits - 15 minutes

Let's say you are currently getting your degree in Civil Engineering from Duke University.  You have about 2 years left of education benefits, but would like to start the application and check to see if you're eligible.  How would you go about filling out this application?
  
  Things to watch for:
  - How do users react to alerts and warnings about eligibility?
  
  
  Upon completion of the task:
  - What did you think of the alert?
  - What would you do after you saw this message?



## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

Those are all the tasks I have for you today. 

-	Do you have general thoughts or feedback on the application that you’d like to share? 
-	Any questions for me?
- I want to give a chanced to the other people on the line to ask a question.

## Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, thanks so much and enjoy the rest of your day!
