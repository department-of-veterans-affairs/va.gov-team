# Research Plan for STEM
As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	(This should be filled out and maintained by the designer on the team & can be cross-linked and referenced in any issues.) 	
## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	
- Booz Allen research for Education Services / OIT
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

Currently, Veterans applying for the Rogers STEM Scholarship to extend their CH33 benefits must use the 22-1995 form (Request for Change of Program or Place of Training). The addition of STEM scholarship questions to this form was a temporary solution while decisions on a stand-alone form were made.

With the inclusion of the STEM scholarship as part of the 22-1995, adjustments were made to the form which allowed users with 2 different goals to use the same form. With the introduction of a new, separate form for the Rogers STEM Scholarship, users will be able to complete the form they need, thus streamlining the application process for all users.

During the initial implementation of the STEM Scholarship application as part of the 22-1995, an issue arose where a high number of ineligible people (>80% of applicants) were applying for the scholarship, resulting in significant work for the application processors. Steps were taken to address that as part of the 22-1995, and an integral part of the new form is to continue to drive the number of ineligible submissions down.  

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 

- What do users understand about scholarship eligibility? (e.g. their program of study, credit hours, entitlement exhaustion)
  - Do users expect the system to tell them if they are eligible?  And if so, how?
  - Do users understand the requirements for their program of study to be STEM eligible?
  - Do users understand the requirements for the amount of their remaining entitlement for STEM eligibility?  Do they know how much entitlement they have remaining?
- What are user expectations for how ineligible applications are handled while they are filling out the application?
- Do any questions cause confusion or require additional research for users to answer?
- What are users' expectations about how the direct deposit info they provide will be used?

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	
 - When presented with requirements, users will understand if they eligible for the STEM scholarship and be able to successfully complete and submit the application.  
   - STEM-eligible users will be able to fill out most of the application with little outside research though some research (i.e. number of credit hours required to complete degree) is expected.  
   - Users who are not eligible will abandon the application before submission when presented with clear alerts that their application will likely be denied.
 
## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  - Remote moderated usability testing 	
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?
  - Since this application is being broken off from the 1995, researchers need to determine what information is critical to acquire from users - and that the application can stand alone on its own.  Additionally, this application currently has an 80% rejection rate. Researchers need to observe users to help determine the root cause of why so many ineligible applicants are still applying for the scholarship.  
3.	Where are you planning to do your research? 
- Online using Zoom
4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 	
- We will be testing content and flow using high fidelity prototypes
5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)
  - Zoom 
  
## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?

## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
- June 4 - 5, 2020 	
2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	
- By COB June 2, 2020
3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? 	
- 45 minutes
4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.	
- June 4, 2020 from 8 - 11 AM, 12 PM - 2PM, 3-6 PM

5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	
- June 3, 2020
