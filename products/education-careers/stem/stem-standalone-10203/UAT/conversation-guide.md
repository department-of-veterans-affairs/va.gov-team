## Introduction
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. The purpose of today's session is for us to observe you submitting an application for the VA's STEM Scholarship using the 22-10203 form on VA.gov. To reiterate what we've discussed during our earlier conversations, the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship provides up to nine months of additional Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits (to a maximum of $30,000) to qualifying Veterans and Fry Scholars seeking an undergraduate STEM degree or who have earned a STEM degree and are seeking a teaching certification.

Before we get started, I want to begin by thanking you for your willingness to participate in this session. Your participation allows us to ensure that other veterans who will be using this form in the future will have a good experience.

**FOR INELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS** 
As we begin, I want to note that there are a number of warnings built into the form that discourage ineligible participants from applying. Today, we'd like you to continue the application process when you see those warnings because our goal is to test the application all the way through submission.  We are interested in your input on these warnings so feel free to let me know what you’d normally do if you saw one if the form submission wasn’t the goal of this session.

A few more things I want to mention:
•	** There are a few other individuals on the line observing.**  They are watching for any errors or unexpected behavior that may arise in the system during the application process.
•	** This entire session should take no more than 30 minutes.** 
•	** In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**  We will not be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your feedback.
•	** If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

## Script for Signed In participants

2.	During the Screen or Application share, move your mouse to the top of the screen to the Webex panel and click the Assign button.
3.	Select "Pass Keyboard and Mouse Control", then select the participant you would like to assign control to.
4.	Now that the participant has control, have them sign in to VA.gov by clicking the blue "Sign in" button in the top right corner of the screen
5.	Now that the applicant is signed in, have them scroll down to the "How do I apply" section and click the green "Find your education benefits form" button
6.	The applicant should select the "Applying to extend my Post-9/11 or Fry Scholarship benefits using the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship" radio button
7.	The applicant should select the "Yes" radio button in response to the following question "Based on the eligibility requirements above, do you want to apply for this scholarship?" followed by selecting the green "Apply now" button.
8.	The applicant should now be prompted for the "basic auth" credentials. The facilitator should take control back from the participant and enter the credentials so as to keep them secure. The credentials can be found in the team's Keybase chat.

#### Things to watch for:
1.	The individual needs to be signed in on VA.gov prior to accessing the wizard in order to be routed correctly to the 22-10203
2.	Confirm that after clicking "Apply now" the applicant is routed to https://staging.va.gov/education/other-va-education-benefits/stem-scholarship/apply-for-scholarship-form-22-10203/introduction

#### Things to watch for:
•	On the direct deposit screen, applicants who do not want to impact any current payments they are receiving can select "I don't want to use direct deposit"

### Third Task: Review & Submit Application
1.	On the Application Review screen, have the applicant expand each accordion to ensure that the content matches their entries. You may want them to update their responses on this screen to see that all updates occur as expected. 
2.	When the applicant has confirmed everything is as expected, ask them to submit their application
3.	Capture their confirmation number so that it can be passed along to Education Services for review.
4.	Ask the applicant to log out of the application.

#### Things to watch for:
- Does the user see the eligibility alerts? 
- Does prefill data populate correctly? 
- Does the form data populate “Review application” correctly?  
- Does the form submit? 

### Post-Task Interview - X minutes
- How did you think that went?
- Was there anything that was unclear as you were filling in the application? 
- What would you expect would happen next? 
- Any questions for me?

### Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

We really appreciate you taking the time to do this today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for other Veterans.
