**Email subject:** VA Rogers STEM Scholarship, Application Denied

Dear { Fname Lname },

We've carefully reviewed your claim for education benefits submitted [MM/DD/YYYY] under the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship (Public Law 115-48, Section 111). We're unable to approve your claim at this time.

**Why we denied your claim**

We've denied your claim for the Rogers STEM Scholarship because:

{ Relevant reason(s) will be displayed below and others will be deleted }

- You have more than 6 months of Post 9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) benefits remaining as of [MM/DD/YYYY].  By law, all Rogers STEM Scholarship recipients must have 6 months or less of Post 9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) benefits left (Public Law 115-48, Section 111 (b)).  If you enroll in a later term and have less than 6 months of benefits left, you can re-apply for this scholarship at that time.

- You don't meet the degree requirements. By law, all Rogers STEM Scholarship recipients must either be:

   - Enrolled in an eligible STEM undergraduate degree
   - Have an eligible STEM undergraduate degree and be pursuing a teaching degree
 
  You answered "No" to the following questions on the Rogers STEM scholarship application. Applicants must answer "Yes" to one of these questions to be eligible.
 
   - "Are you enrolled in a science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) degree program?"
   
        - You answered: No
       
   - "Do you have a STEM undergraduate degree and are now pursuing a teaching certification?"
   
        - You answered: No
