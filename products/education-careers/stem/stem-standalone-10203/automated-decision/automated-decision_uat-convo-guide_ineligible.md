## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. The purpose of today's session is for us to observe you submitting an application for the VA's STEM Scholarship using the 22-10203 form on VA.gov. Before we get started, I want to begin by thanking you for your willingness to participate in this session. Your participation allows us to ensure that other veterans who will be using this form in the future will have a good experience.

FOR INELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS As we begin, I want to note that there are a number of warnings built into the form that discourage ineligible participants from applying. Today, we'd like you to continue the application process when you see those warnings because our goal is to test the application all the way through submission. We are interested in your input on these warnings so feel free to let me know what you’d normally do if you saw one if the form submission wasn’t the goal of this session.

A few more things I want to mention: 
- ** There are a few other individuals on the line observing.** They are watching for any errors or unexpected behavior that may arise in the system during the application process. 
• ** This entire session should take no more than 30 minutes.** 
• ** In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We will not be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your feedback. • ** If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

### First Task: Webex Sharing & Accessing the Application - 5 minutes
1.	The Zoom Host closes all additional screens, programs and windows that might interfere. The Zoom Host opens the following screen in Google Chrome: https://va.gov/education/gi-bill/post-9-11/ch-33-benefit/ and shares the Chrome window.
2.	During the Screen or Application share, move your mouse to the top of the screen to the Webex panel and click the Assign button.
3.	Select "Pass Keyboard and Mouse Control", then select the participant you would like to assign control to.
4.	Now that the participant has control, have them sign in to VA.gov by clicking the blue "Sign in" button in the top right corner of the screen. **As they do this, the development team member on the call should be granting them access to the form via the feature flag based on their email address associated with their VA.gov account**
6.	Now that the applicant is signed in, have them review their remaining benefits to determine whether or not they will be eligible based on months remaining. 
7.  From https://www.va.gov/education/how-to-apply/, have them scroll down to the "How do I apply" section and click the green "Find your education benefits form" button
8.	The applicant should select the "Applying to extend my Post-9/11 or Fry Scholarship benefits using the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship" radio button
9.	The applicant should select the "Yes" radio button in response to the following question "Based on the eligibility requirements above, do you want to apply for this scholarship?" followed by selecting the green "Apply now" button.
10.	The applicant should now be entered into the application

   a. capture their response to the (STEM) degree program and teaching certification question
   a. ensure that remaining entitlement is displayed in the "Your remaining education benefits" alert
5. Applicant should continue through the application until they reach the application review screen.

#### Things to watch for:

2. On the direct deposit screen, applicants who do not want to impact any current payments they are receiving can select "I don't want to use direct deposit"
3. On the application introduction screen, confirm that variation of the following alert appears at the top of the application and includes remaining entitlement:
"You may not be eligible....Months you have left to use: XX months, XX days" (seen here: https://bahdigital.invisionapp.com/share/JHIAE4UVKA4#/screens/296040759)

### Third Task: Review & Submit Application
1.	On the Application Review screen, have the applicant expand each accordion to ensure that the content matches their entries. You may want them to update their responses on this screen to see that all updates occur as expected. 
2.	When the applicant has confirmed everything is as expected, ask them to submit their application
3.	Capture their confirmation number so that it can be passed along to Education Services for review.
4.	Ask the applicant to log out of the application.

#### Things to watch for:
- Does the user see the eligibility alerts? 
- Does prefill data populate correctly? 
- Does the form data populate “Review application” correctly?  
- Does the form submit? If not, be sure to capture any errors. If yes, be sure to capture the confirmation number

### Fourth Task: Review Claim Status
1. Automated decisions are processed every two minutes. The participant can navigate to https://www.va.gov/claim-or-appeal-status/ and wait for their claim to appear on the page. 
2. When their claim appears on the page, they should click on it to review the claim details. 

### Alternate Fourth Task: Email & Claim Status
1. A member of the application team will manually run the process that executes automated decisions
2. The participant will check their email
3. If the automated decision email was received, the participant will click the link to review claim status (https://www.va.gov/claim-or-appeal-status/). 
4. On the claim status page, the applicant will select their most recent STEM application (the one just submitted) and review the information on the claim details page. 

#### Things to watch for:
- Did the AD email get sent?
- Did the claim status page reflect the most recent application in order of submission date?
- Did the claim details page display the expected information?
