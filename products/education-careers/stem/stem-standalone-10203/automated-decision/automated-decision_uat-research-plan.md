# UAT Research Plan for STEM Scholarship (22-10203) Automated Decisio

## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?
   VA.gov Education (#vsa-education) team is preparing to release new functionality to be incorporated to the STEM Scholarship application on VA.gov that would provide "automated denial" decisions upon submission of the application.
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?	
   This enhancement to the STEM Scholarship form is being made in an effort to reduce the number of applications that require processing by the Buffalo RPO. Historically, there have been a high percentage of ineligible applications that require processing because the application itself is relatively simple to complete and the potential payoff is high (up to $30,000). There are a few required fields within the application that on their own indicate an individual's eligibility and these are the fields we are utilizing to trigger an automated denial. In addition, we are also planning to the addition of a POA indicator to the spool file reports to be processed by the Buffalo RPO
3. Research questions:
   1. Are applicants being automatically denied as expected? Are they receiving appropriate communication upon automatic denial?
   2. Are applicants able to view the status of their application on VA.gov?
   2. Are any applicants being automatically denied who should not be?
   3. Is the spool file being updated for applicants based on whether or not they have POA associated with their EVSS profile?
4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? Applicants are being denied as expected, receiving appropriate email communication upon automatic denial, and able to view their application status on VA.gov

## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  - **Sample Methodologies**: Remote moderated user acceptance testing with Veterans on Production 	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? We are unable to complete testing on staging due to limitations of EVSS test data located there. With this, the best way to test that the functionality is working as expected is with Veterans on Production through submissions of actual applications. 
3.	Where are you planning to do your research? Via webconference and screenshare
4.	What will you be testing? The live 22-10203 application  	
5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use? Zoom via Perigean

## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)	

We are hoping to recruit 10 total participants: 
- 8 ineligible particiapnts 
   - Of the 8 ineligible, we'd like at least 3 of them to have Power of Attorneys on file with LTS/VA.gov
- 2 eligible participants

More specifically: 
- 4 Ineligible participants due to program type
- 4 Ineligible participants due to remaining entitlement
- 2 Eligible participants

Please list your participant criteria in two categories-
1. **Primary criteria / Must have** - what absolutely must be true in order to run your study? The clearer you can write this criteria, the easier it is to find matches for your study. (i.e. if your study will only work if you're talking to Veterans who have My HealtheVet premium accounts, mention that here. OR, if you are using a prototype tool that will not work well with screen readers, mention that as well.)
