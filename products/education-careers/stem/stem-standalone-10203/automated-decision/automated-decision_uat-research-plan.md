# UAT Research Plan for STEM Scholarship (22-10203) Automated Decision

As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	(This should be filled out and maintained by the designer on the team & can be cross-linked and referenced in any issues.) 	

## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?
   VA.gov Education (#vsa-education) team is preparing to release new functionality to be incorporated to the STEM Scholarship application on VA.gov that would provide "automated denial" decisions upon submission of the application.
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?	
   This enhancement to the STEM Scholarship form is being made in an effort to reduce the number of applications that require processing by the Buffalo RPO. Historically, there have been a high percentage of ineligible applications that require processing because the application itself is relatively simple to complete and the potential payoff is high (up to $30,000). There are a few required fields within the application that on their own indicate an individual's eligibility and these are the fields we are utilizing to trigger an automated denial. In addition, we are also planning to the addition of a POA indicator to the spool file reports to be processed by the Buffalo RPO
3. Research questions:
   1. Are applicants being automatically denied as expected? Are they receiving appropriate communication upon automatic denial?
   2. Are any applicants being automatically denied who should not be?
   3. Is the spool file being updated for applicants based on whether or not they have POA associated with their EVSS profile?
4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	

## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  - **Sample Methodologies**: Directed interviews; ethnographic interviews; observation; card sorts; tree tests; guerilla usability testing; usability testing with low- or high-fidelity prototypes; user acceptance testing. 	
  - **Also mention:** in-person moderated, remote moderated, remote unmoderated	
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	
3.	Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)*	
4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 	
5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	
## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)	

Please list your participant criteria in two categories-
1. **Primary criteria / Must have** - what absolutely must be true in order to run your study? The clearer you can write this criteria, the easier it is to find matches for your study. (i.e. if your study will only work if you're talking to Veterans who have My HealtheVet premium accounts, mention that here. OR, if you are using a prototype tool that will not work well with screen readers, mention that as well.) 

2. **Secondary criteria / Would like to have** - what other criteria would strengthen your results?

*Pro tips for writing recruiting critera:* 
- If you have specific screener questions that YOU would ask a potential participant to determine eligibility for your study, list them here. For example, instead of saying "We want someone who has been to an urgent care facility recently", say "Have you been to an urgent care facility in the last 6 months? (Answer should be yes)"
- Do not assume that your recruiters or the participants know your products or requirements as well as you do. Provide links to products, clear descriptions, specifics, etc. 

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
(If in person, describe how you will find participants. If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract - Perigean - or if there are other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project. If you need help, please contact Research Contract Lead.)	

## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 	
2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	
3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.
4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.	Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.
5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	
## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work**
