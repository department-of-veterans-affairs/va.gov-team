## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. The purpose of today's session is for us to observe you submitting an application for the VA's STEM Scholarship using the 22-10203 form on VA.gov. The Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship provides up to nine months of additional Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits (to a maximum of $30,000) to qualifying Veterans and Fry Scholars seeking an undergraduate STEM degree or who have earned a STEM degree and are seeking a teaching certification.

Before we get started, I want to begin by thanking you for your willingness to participate in this session. Your participation allows us to ensure that other veterans who will be using this form in the future will have a good experience.

FOR INELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS As we begin, I want to note that there are a number of warnings built into the form that discourage ineligible participants from applying. Today, we'd like you to continue the application process when you see those warnings because our goal is to test the application all the way through submission. We are interested in your input on these warnings so feel free to let me know what you’d normally do if you saw one if the form submission wasn’t the goal of this session.

A few more things I want to mention: 
- ** There are a few other individuals on the line observing.** They are watching for any errors or unexpected behavior that may arise in the system during the application process. • ** This entire session should take no more than 30 minutes.** • ** In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We will not be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your feedback. • ** If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

### First Task: Webex Sharing & Accessing the Application - 5 minutes
1.	The WebEx facilitator closes all additional screens, programs and windows that might interfere The WebEx facilitator opens the following screen in Google Chrome: https://va.gov/education/gi-bill/post-9-11/ch-33-benefit/ and shares the Chrome window.
2.	During the Screen or Application share, move your mouse to the top of the screen to the Webex panel and click the Assign button.
3.	Select "Pass Keyboard and Mouse Control", then select the participant you would like to assign control to.
4.	Now that the participant has control, have them sign in to VA.gov by clicking the blue "Sign in" button in the top right corner of the screen
5.	Now that the applicant is signed in, have them review their remaining benefits to determine whether or not they will be eligible based on months remaining. 
6.  After , have them scroll down to the "How do I apply" section and click the green "Find your education benefits form" button
6.	The applicant should select the "Applying to extend my Post-9/11 or Fry Scholarship benefits using the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship" radio button
