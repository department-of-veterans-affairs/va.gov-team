## Overview
Create an application for the Rogers STEM Scholarship that is 508 compliant and delivers digital submission capabilities for VA Form 22-10203.

## Problem Statement
Currently, Veterans applying for the Rogers STEM Scholarship to extend their CH33 benefits must use the 22-1995 form (Request for Change of Program or Place of Training).  The addition of STEM scholarship questions to this form was a temporary solution while decisions on a stand-alone form were made.  

With the inclusion of the STEM scholarship as part of the 22-1995, adjustments were made to the form which allowed users with 2 different goals to use the same form.  With the introduction of a new, separate form for the Rogers STEM Scholarship, users will be able to complete the form they need, thus streamlining the application process for all users.

During the initial implementation of the STEM Scholarship application as part of the 22-1995, an issue arose where a high number of ineligible people (>80% of applicants) were applying for the scholarship, resulting in significant work for the application processors.  Steps were taken to address that as part of the 22-1995, and an integral part of the new form is to continue to drive the number of ineligible submissions down.

How might we increase valid submissions of 22-1995 and 22-10203, and streamline the application process for Veterans using either of the two forms?
 
## Desired User Outcomes
	- Veterans are able to apply for the STEM Scholarship without assistance.
	- Veterans understand what the STEM Scholarship criteria are and don't apply for the scholarship if they're not remotely qualified.
	- Veterans are able to apply for Change of Program or Place of Training at least as effectively as they were before the STEM Scholarship questions were added to the 22-1995 form. 

## Undesired User Outcomes
	- Veterans are still routed to the 22-1995 to apply for the STEM Scholarship by dated URLs 
	- TBD

## Desired Business Outcomes
	- Veterans use new form when applying for STEM Scholarship
	- Only Veterans who are eligible for the STEM Scholarship complete the form through submission
	- Veterans no longer use the 22-1995 to apply for the STEM scholarship
	- 22-1995 retains improvements made as part of the STEM Scholarship updates 
	
## Undesired Business Outcomes
	- Veterans apply for the STEM Scholarship regardless of their eligibility for the program.

## Assumptions
	- The 22-10203 STEM Scholarship application form will not change going forward.
	- The 22-10203 STEM Scholarship application can be completed without involving a School Certifying Official (SCO) in digital application process.
	
## Solution Approach
- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*

We're going to build a simple, streamlined application form. We have a solid foundation with the work we've already completed on 22-1995. 

- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*

To be compliant with the available application forms.

- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*

We are not including any steps where a SCO is involved in the digital application for the Rogers STEM Scholarship.  Instructions will be provided so this part of the application process will be handled outside of the VA.gov form submission.

- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

We may find a way to solve for SCO support of applications. 

## KPIs
- *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
- Successful 22-10203 STEM Scholarship Application submissions esp. compared to applications via 22-1995
- Valid 22-10203 Application submissions, # and %

## Go-to-market Strategy
- *How are Veterans and others using this product going to know it exists?*
	- Education Service email promotions have been very effective for this scholarship since it launched last year. 
	- Veterans will be directed to the new STEM Scholarship form via the education benefits wizard.
	
- *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful?*
	- Education Service will be updated via project briefings & demos
	- Veterans will be updated via Education Service / Communications email & social promotions about the new application process

## Target Launch Date
- *What is your target launch date of your MVP/iteration?*
	- Beginning of July; subject to contract continuation.

- *What is your date for when you'll evaluate impact after launch?*
	- End of July; Ideally a date 1 month after launch. Subject to contract continuation.
