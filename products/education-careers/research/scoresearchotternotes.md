# SCO Research Transcripts by Otter.ai, August 2019
## Interviews by Kevin Hoffman between August 5 and August 9, 2019

## Columbia Southern
Unknown Speaker  0:04  
So

Unknown Speaker  0:06  
let's start your role and tell me about like how long you've been at Columbia Southern and what kind of what the the office that you work with or support is responsible for.

Unknown Speaker  0:18  
Okay, I'll just in August of last year, I retired from the military after 32 years, moved down to the Gulf Shores, or the coastal Alabama region in the position, I noticed I was looking for a job. And notice they were advertising for a director of veteran initiatives at Columbia Southern University, which is very close to where I moved, moved to. So apply for that, and interviewed and got the position started with the University in October of 2009. of AP. are yet 2018. Yeah, to the and then. And then the, they wanted to build a Veterans Program for the university. What the The university has catered to military and veterans for a number of years, but they didn't have a veterans specific department that would dress the comprehensive veterans, the student veterans issues and things like that. So in January, we began operating, doing a number of different things, I created what was what I call the veterans initiative, operational approach, which links in with our strategic plan, engage veterans that go to the school and those that are outside the school, and to provide outreach and availability of educational services that we provide.

Unknown Speaker  1:55  
The big thing is that,

Unknown Speaker  1:59  
like I said, we're we're just starting the program. So I kind of got a lot of latitude. of fact, all the things I want to do with the Veterans Program here at the university don't fit in the amount of time I have to do it all. So it's, it's, it's been a very busy time. In fact, I just returned from a veterans event that was in Las Vegas with the American GI Forum, which is a smaller veterans organization that's headquartered in Colorado. And they're in about eight states, was a very good event very, very fruitful and allowed me to learn a lot about their veterans outreach, and the veterans programs. What we're trying to do here is, I guess, like I said, two things. There's external engagement and internal engagement, internally, we want to support we, the goal is to support all the student veterans that go to the university, and also administer to our chapter of the Student Veterans of America, which has been kind of a primary focus of mine. To get that I'm the chapter advisor as well as the as well as the director of veterans initiatives. It's it's a little bit difficult.

Unknown Speaker  3:19  
Right now, because the

Unknown Speaker  3:23  
the chat, chapter in and of itself is difficult to get people to, to participate in. But the the addition of being an online school and having all these chapter members spread out all the United States is is a unique challenge as well, it also has some benefits in that our chapter membership isn't in one physical location, and that our student veterans who belong to the chapter can reach out to other people across the country, and talk about veterans issues or veteran situations that they different parts of the country, as well. Maybe even look for job opportunities or other other things that are going on in different parts of the country. So we're just kind of getting started here. There's a lot of things going on. And we're kind of refining some of our veterans engagement veteran support things as we go. But and we're learning a lot as we go through. It's kind of basically it to this point right now, unless you want some more very specific details of some of the engagement events that we've gone on so far.

Unknown Speaker  4:43  
Yeah, no, I'm given how busy you are. And the fact that you're just kind of getting this thing off the ground. I appreciate the time this morning. I gotta I have a couple of questions, specific to different aspects of how you are either planning to engage with veterans or how you might already engage with them.

Unknown Speaker  5:03  
Roughly,

Unknown Speaker  5:05  
and it doesn't need to be like a number from a report, but roughly about how many veterans or military affiliated students are you supporting or working with at this point?

Unknown Speaker  5:16  
Okay, well, there's a proximate Lee

Unknown Speaker  5:21  
3800 veterans that go to the school right now.

Unknown Speaker  5:26  
Directly I work with,

Unknown Speaker  5:33  
you know,

Unknown Speaker  5:36  
trying to think of how many that I actually engage with frequently, it's in the few dozen, because I'm interacting with them directly, we do do reach out individually to some of our student veterans at work that are already going to the university and just introduce the director. And a lot of times, you're just leaving a message for them, or sending them an email or a text message just to introduce the department. And I've done that for quite a bit of veterans. I mean, we're up into the, you know, several hundred engagement attempts. But as far as actually talking to them and dealing with the issues. You know, hold me Hold on, there's another speaker that's in the office here. Hold on one second.

Unknown Speaker  6:44  
Yeah, my, my office mate left is a speaker on with the Bluetooth, so

Unknown Speaker  6:52  
I didn't even hear it.

Unknown Speaker  6:54  
It was it was chirping in the background of distracting me.

Unknown Speaker  7:00  
Yeah, so

Unknown Speaker  7:03  
it varies, I've had direct engagement with a couple dozen on a continuous basis, but of the 3800, some of them probably even don't even know about our program, yet, if they didn't open up one of my emails or, or, you know, didn't and the voicemails, like I said, it's, it's a bit difficult to reach out to all of them. So we're kind of going methodically through the list that we have, of those that have identified as veteran or ones that we know, are veterans based on the benefits that they're utilizing. That's been the difficult part, when I first got into the university is there was in our data systems, they didn't build in like a button that wants a veteran self identified, that would be considered the would, they would have a captured a way of identifying that that trend throughout their, you know, the, throughout their time here at the university, if they changed a pattern of benefits, like from using GI bill to some other form, let's say they ran out of their GI Bill, and then they went on, like financial aid or something like that. And they change that method, the way the data system was set up, you could lose the visibility of that, unless you search through other data sources, like there was a certificate of eligibility on file or something like that. So it's so so we were working through some of those identification things, so that we can kind of reach out make sure that we're, but if here's, here's the one example that I use, internally in the university that I have a vice president of our Student Veterans of America, his employer was paying, it was paying for tuition. And he did not identify himself in any of the application process as a veteran or a form, or any form or service component that he was part of. Yet, he was our Vice President of our Student Veterans of America. And then after talking to him, he was a Navy veteran and he and he was working in, he's actually close in the area here, up around Mobile, Alabama, I've talked to him a couple couple times about this book, our Vice President of our student veterans or chapter here was not even identified as a veteran within our data system. So we've been really kind of had a little bit of difficulty in in some of the, I would say,

Unknown Speaker  10:01  
identification type mechanisms that we have.

Unknown Speaker  10:07  
Well, we're trying to do that get that the information of the department out to as many of the veterans that go to school here, so that they know they can contact us. And over the last six months, I've noticed that people are starting to engage us in responding to some of those some of those kind of announcement type information mechanisms that we've done, and I'm getting some of that. So we will do a comp, we do kind of like a kind of like a comprehensive umbrella. In each of the departments and the registrar and the admissions and our financial aid. There are very well trained individuals that understand GI Bill gi benefits and all that. So they they do a really good job. The problem is finding out who those people are within those different larger departments. Well, instead of the veterans haven't figured that out, they can contact us and I can link them up with anyone directly. That would best suit what their question or what information they're looking for.

Unknown Speaker  11:26  
So a couple of questions really quick. First of all, you deal with pre application veterans, like veterans who have not yet applied to the university, but are thinking about attending.

Unknown Speaker  11:41  
Right, right.

Unknown Speaker  11:43  
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  11:44  
So like at this last event, I was promoting the university, doing basically brand recognition, some and then there were a couple individuals at the conference that said, I haven't completed my degree, I'm thinking about doing it. So what I did is I I said, Okay, would you like, here's some information, I give out a lot of the collateral that we have information booklets, our veterans, and then if they wanted more information, they could give me their their name and some contact information that I'll provide to the admissions department, which the admissions department knows all the technical forms and, and the different options that they would have, we kind of give them a brief overview of that, or point them to the, to the information, usually, and right now it's the department, our department here is just two people, myself, and another veterans education rap, who is actually was in Memphis last week, but and he was doing the same type of outreach type two to those veterans that were out there.

Unknown Speaker  12:58  
Okay, so so like other than kind of what I would call marketing representation, where you're showing, you know, kind of connecting interested parties, as you come across them, you more of your work is focused on existing students, and kind of getting all of them to the right person for the problem they need. So right,

Unknown Speaker  13:20  
it's a, it's a 5050 thing, I have what I have what I call my veterans engagement model. And what it is, it's a, it's a lot of circles, like a bullseye. In the middle is our Student Veterans of America chapter. Those are students of the university that have, you know, they've shown an interest not only do identify as a veteran, but they want to be engaged as a veteran within the veterans population within the university. The next outer ring on that one is our student veterans that, that go to the university. Now, some of them, you know, are not part of the chapter, but they still engage in the university as being a veteran and all that and some we haven't got a chance to talk to that's part of that 3800 as a total, we have the ring of the veterans initiatives department, that's kind of like everything on the inside the event of the veterans initiatives is internal engagement. On the outside, we have our veterans alumni, which we do engagement with them as well, because I think our number is it. Overall, in the university, about 38% of the students that go here, I think it was 38% were referred to referred to us by another student. So are our student alum, our student veteran, or our veteran alumni is a very powerful tool in engaging other veterans that maybe interested in going and going to go into college and, and the other educational opportunities that we can provide them. And then of course, the outer ring is the is the veterans at large across the United States. And what we do is we we understand that you just can't it's it's it's there there are spread out all over the United States. So there's no one concentration other than through veterans organizations. So we do a that's where we do we go to these conferences and things like that, to engage them. So that's kind of like the engagement model. In a synopsis. I got a I got a slide that identifies how all those different connections work. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  15:49  
no, I can visualize it. And and like,

Unknown Speaker  15:53  
based on the way you've described it, my assumption is that, you know, you're engaging at all levels of the bullseye. But you Our goal is to move people from the outer to the gutter,

Unknown Speaker  16:02  
correct that. And that's what I have on my slide it has has different arrows that take what the engagement mechanism is. And usually when you get to the outside, I can't directly call every veteran out there and ask them if they're interested in going to school. Right? Here's the third, we understand that third party mechanisms have to be involved. And what we want to do is provide those those veterans organizations information about us build trust, build, build, understanding and build partnerships with them. And if we can help out their their membership, and for provide that information, that just that helps them do some of the outreach that they do, and it helps us identify and attract other veterans, student veterans.

Unknown Speaker  16:54  
You said there were third party mechanisms. I'm assuming one of them is the student vets of America.

Unknown Speaker  17:00  
What are some of the other third party mechanisms?

Unknown Speaker  17:02  
Well, you like the American Legion, the like the small the veterans organization? I went to this this past week, which was the American GI Forum. And that's we've, we go to see where else have we gone, then? Well, one that deals with veterans as noncommissioned officers Association, usually professional organizations, we did a a one day presentation during the National Veterans Wheelchair Games in Louisville. Last month. It was just a that was a very different type event. But it was more for like brand recognition. Those go back to the noncommissioned officers Association, and they, they are a have already had an established partnership with the University. So that was more of a reinforcing effort that we had there in addressing, and we run across some of our students, just about at every one of these conferences. So it's really refreshing to see a lot of these student veterans, some of them are still in the active service to as they, as they're part of these professional organizations as well. But we usually do engage, you know, that's kind of like that third party engagement. If we form these alliances and partnerships with these veterans organizations, and we can mutually support each other, then then we then we have an opportunity to engage their membership as a whole. Got it?

Unknown Speaker  18:46  
So what are some of the most

Unknown Speaker  18:50  
common questions that you guys get from veterans and service members? Like what are the categories? Or what are the really you know, challenging ones that come up off?

Unknown Speaker  18:59  
Well, banner Fitz is always the one is can I use my benefits? What is there when I run out of my benefits? You know, that's the largest the one of the one of the trickiest ones actually didn't. It's something I did at the university, which is very interested in. Because coming out of a, I was a little background, I was I retired off the active Guard Reserve Program out of Michigan, I was the Chief of Staff for the Michigan Army National Guard. And before that, I was the director of personnel and we engaged in you know, things with our soldiers, I'd like PTSD and, and one of our disability services had an issue with a student of ours that had a pts trigger, based on the course that they were in. And that was one of the ones where I was able to, to present information that I knew from my background to the this small group that was that was assembled to deal with this, this veterans issue. And it was very refreshing to see the all hands on deck kind of mentality in understanding or trying to understand that these things, they're very difficult to anticipate. There's no real defined patterns of how a pts trigger happens and what what the effects are, other than the veteran is put in a very, I guess, vulnerable situation that they really are looking for help. And we were able to help this student rapidly and get them transferred into a different course. So that they continue their could continue their studies. It was it was really nice to see that in the organization, especially how fast we were able to do that. That was that was kind of like the difficult one. But with everyone pitching in, it worked really well here. Got it.

Unknown Speaker  21:16  
You said that

Unknown Speaker  21:18  
the most common one is benefits. Are there any particular sub categories and benefits that you are challenges you come up against? Or? Or issues that are common to multiple benefit questions?

Unknown Speaker  21:33  
I haven't. Now, this is where, you know, when we get into these benefits issues, I will either go upstairs and talk to the folks that are in financial aid. On certain things. I'm trying to think of the last one that I went up there. And they're just real easy ones, like reimbursement for certain items when they you know, the real kind of easy stuff right now, because not a lot of our veteran student veterans know about the department yet is trying to get the word out, I'm sure like I said, things are starting to trickle in. Now that we've been added for, you know, about eight months, really heavily trying to engage that internal population. But usually, our financial aid folks are so well trained in the the benefits once we get them into that stream. I rarely even hear back from them again, other than a Thanks for the help or something like that, and really don't get a lot of the feedback on how everything was resolved unless they want to call me and talk about it specifically, which rarely happens.

Unknown Speaker  22:55  
I'm changing gears a little bit, how do you feel about websites where veterans might post feedback about your school? there? There are different examples of this kind of site. I mean, Facebook is a place where that happens. There's a website called nice calm,

Unknown Speaker  23:14  
like does your school pay attention to the kind of feedback that's posted on different sites about the school itself?

Unknown Speaker  23:23  
I would have to

Unknown Speaker  23:26  
I've, I've only looked at some of the stuff on our student, our Facebook page.

Unknown Speaker  23:35  
I'm not sure I'd have to get into our marketing department on that. I will look at it from to see if there's anything like a veteran specific issue. But I have to filter through a large number, like I said that we have 30 about 3800 veterans that go to school here, but that's out of like 30,000 students. So right now I don't have a mechanism that would filter through and look at feedback that's coming in on the veteran side, all the way and welcome it because the only way that you can get better is to know where some of our deficiencies might be from the student student veteran aspect. So yeah, it's it. I don't think our school afraid of any feedback that comes back to us. As far as servicing our students, and especially our student veterans.

Unknown Speaker  24:28  
That, are there any websites that you see as reliable websites to Ford veterans to besides the.edu, besides like your, your website,

Unknown Speaker  24:39  
you know that that's been a challenge to because some of these college evaluation sites that you put information into, and then there's the ranking of different programs that are better for veterans or better for service members. You wonder about our is the rankings, kind of tied to the amount of sponsorship a school will provide? There are some of those so so distinguish the good sites from the ones that are more, the more sponsorship, you provide it, the better off you kind of look on their site, I don't know if there's a good way to to distinguish ones that are based on

Unknown Speaker  25:32  
a

Unknown Speaker  25:33  
true just data. And when we're talking about data, it's, that's the other difficult part between a traditional university or the way they evaluate traditional universities versus online institutions, which may have different aspects of how that student goes through their educational process. As far as time, the time they use, you know, it's it's not the coming out of high school and going to school for four years in a painting degree or not obtaining a degree, it's a little bit, when you're dealing with a large majority of adult learners, you got a lot of different things that affect it, which affects some of the way the data is pulled and displayed on the sites, some consistency of information requirements, that would be helpful. One of the ones that I was trying to work with which the American Legion actually has partnered up was was a college recon was one of them, and I was trying to work with them on because we didn't Haven't we don't have enough representation on that site yet. And it's just a matter of getting into the cycle and, and the timing of it. But that, again, is it's a it's service that we would have to subscribe to, to be part of that be listed in there. So but they had a good reputation from the way they the way they presented data, and they must have had enough trust from the American Legion for them to deliver that educational content through the American Legion. So that was one specifically that I've actually sat down and talk to the folks there. And since the veterans and American Legion is kind of the largest Veterans Organization out there, and and they have some quality initiatives internally, when it comes to education of veterans, I thought that they they kind of were, you know, one that I'm I'm still interested in, in working with?

Unknown Speaker  27:53  
Uh huh. Are there any others that you've worked with, but have found? Maybe not to be reliable or not to be helpful?

Unknown Speaker  28:00  
No, I just, I scan through it. And like I said, is sometimes you're listed high on one site, sometimes you're, you're even on the list on other sites. And it's kind of it's it's not really clear on how we could be listed somewhere and not somewhere else. Like I said, other than maybe it's a sponsorship type thing that you do with that website, you know, obviously, they're they need the revenue to continue doing what they're doing as well. If there was, I tell you, if there was a site that was kind of like the honest broker site where folks could be led to say, Hey, this is where this is where it's, this is the actual data, this is the fact checker for veterans out there that I think we would do well in that environment. And I personally would really like see something like that. Got it.

Unknown Speaker  29:06  
So what I'd like to do is take a look at one website, before we go, if you could share your screen, and the easiest way to do that, is just to click on the share screen icon in the middle of the screen, and then select your screen in the upper left and the share button in the lower right.

Unknown Speaker  29:32  
upper left. And

Unknown Speaker  29:38  
that one, yep, I can see it.

Unknown Speaker  29:42  
Alright, so what I'd like you to do is go to the VA website.

Unknown Speaker  29:49  
Is there any particular browser that would be better?

Unknown Speaker  29:54  
Better? Anything's fine.

Unknown Speaker  30:00  
Actually, before we do that, before we go to the VA site, let's go to that college recon site.

Unknown Speaker  30:09  
And use whatever browser you're most comfortable with.

Unknown Speaker  30:25  
Right there.

Unknown Speaker  30:27  
Okay, so, um, let's find the information about your school on here, if you could show me how you how a veteran might find that information. And that's

Unknown Speaker  30:36  
just, that's the thing is we're not you're not on there yet. We're not listed on this yet. We are working to get to that point, it's just getting I you know, I don't have I don't have a budget to to do a subscription. In my budget that comes out of, we have a lot of this type of stuff that has to deal with the internet comes out of our marketing department understood something I had the request to get programmed for next year, which doesn't start till January in our budget cycle. Okay. So we, you know, basically, if just using the college finder, there was that you could enter a school name, but you can see that it automatically comes up. And there's this thing called a partner school. That's, I think, has to do with their their sponsorship level. But some that come out like East Tennessee State that don't have that icon there, and they they appear on the front page here.

Unknown Speaker  31:48  
What they do is, I

Unknown Speaker  31:56  
there's, it's been a number of months since I've played with this sense where I kind of got since I talked to him on at home. So it looks like they've changed it, because I kind of lost.

Unknown Speaker  32:10  
See that. That's the eight keys to eight keys to veteran success.

Unknown Speaker  32:19  
If that was important,

Unknown Speaker  32:28  
it just gives an opportunity. For those people looking for

Unknown Speaker  32:35  
looking for a college to go in here. Like I said, I wish we were listed in here.

Unknown Speaker  32:41  
Now, it says select BH range, remind me what h stands for

Unknown Speaker  32:47  
bH basic allowance for housing. Gotcha. Which will, which will directly relate to the monthly housing allowance and the GI Bill? I just not sure why. I haven't I haven't played with some of these factors in here. And maybe it's because

Unknown Speaker  33:12  
if somebody said I need

Unknown Speaker  33:15  
or if I live in a certain area, or actually if they're looking for certain resources.

Unknown Speaker  33:24  
Now I have heard that

Unknown Speaker  33:27  
there are some folks that get that have gotten stuck in the transfer ability of their BH range doesn't affect us, because we're well, it does affect us. But let's sense the GI Bill is a locked in amount for online schools. It's not like somebody could say, well, I'm going to go to school in San Francisco, to try and get a higher monthly housing allowance and then stay with their, you know, aunt or something that lives in that area, you know, trying to maximize the amount of resources they have to go to school. Oh, you know, I've heard of some people with trip that didn't weren't able to transfer their GI bill that they they the veteran will actually take the courses themselves at a local community college and then use the monthly housing allowance to give send off to their, to their, to their, to their children that are attending university as well. Just because they got stuck in the in the limitations that they had at the time, or transfer ability or they got out and didn't even know they could have transferred it. So there are things out there that are doing the best they can to work inside the rules of the system, but still benefit their family members.

Unknown Speaker  34:59  
Gotcha.

Unknown Speaker  35:00  
Alright, so I have a sense of like, this school, this site, it looks like there's no more additional information besides the title, the paragraph and the phone number. And sometimes

Unknown Speaker  35:12  
I mean, you can go into the, into the school like that was that borrow?

Unknown Speaker  35:16  
I gotcha. There's a profile.

Unknown Speaker  35:18  
There's profiles, and it has, you know, the basic information that comes out of the the

Unknown Speaker  35:27  
What is it?

Unknown Speaker  35:31  
It's the all the required federal government reporting information that you provide

Unknown Speaker  35:41  
military offerings, I mean, there's, there's, there's just this is similar to all the other

Unknown Speaker  35:48  
what I call ranking sites. And that's the big thing is finding out what is how do they do the ranking? Is it? Is it more of a sponsorship focused type thing? Is it about is it? Or is it based on just the information kind of like how US News and World Report does things? They do their college rankings. I'm not sure how they do it. They there's a mechanism they use to evaluate rate, how they rate on there's

Unknown Speaker  36:26  
there's also

Unknown Speaker  36:29  
a college factual was another one, which was an online site.

Unknown Speaker  36:38  
That's a.com. College factual.com. Yeah, I can track it down.

Unknown Speaker  36:48  
At one is a kind of compares colleges as well. Well, who? I think we are on this.

Unknown Speaker  37:06  
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  37:09  
There would be our data right there.

Unknown Speaker  37:21  
So again, they get this

Unknown Speaker  37:26  
information from some sources of data that our university provides, I think the federal government when they pull it national, or and display it in there mechanism. Yep. Understood. But, again, how they do it, how you get like, how do we become the 1300? tunnel? 1300 11th of 1779 best nationwide colleges, I know not sure how they do that algorithm.

Unknown Speaker  38:03  
And that's fine. It's really more, you know, US learning about the different sites and and different things that you might be aware of that come up in conversations with veterans. So if college recon is one that's come up, that's really helpful. And actually,

Unknown Speaker  38:20  
actually, the veterans aren't really, I have yet to run across veterans that I've engaged. Usually, like at the last event, there was only one person at the conference that I talked to, that actually said that they were aware of Columbia Southern University. And the first question that I got is they'll look at the display and they'll say, cumbia Southern University. Where's that? Then you say, Orange Beach, Alabama? Oh, really. And then either you continue a discussion or they just look around and see what kind of information you have there. But some people, because we don't have a large national marketing campaign, like other universities do, it's it's more it's based on that individual engagement. And like I said, we're just starting here with the Veterans Program. So this is kind of like our first time through a lot of the veteran organizations events. Like I mentioned, this one conference, I was just at the American GI Forum. Like next week is the National Association of State directors of Veterans Affairs, which is the state directors, which we went to their midwinter conference in in February in Alexandria, and Secretary Welk he was actually there at the at the conference, and we got invited in to listen to him speak as well. So and that that's, that's more than brand recognition, type thing. We do week the next week, we're going to go to and that's which is in Louisville, and then the week after that is the merican Legion in Indianapolis. So you know, right now it's just a matter of doing a traveling roadshow to get the name out with the with the veterans population.

Unknown Speaker  40:32  
Thank you, I'm just taking some notes and getting caught up with what you were saying. So I don't have any other specific questions for you. Um, do you have any questions for me about what we've discussed today, or what the research that we're doing and what it's meant to inform?

Unknown Speaker  40:49  
Just just I'm, I guess, I have heard of some efforts that are out there right now, within different organizations that are deal with the veterans or military populations. I know, one of the I had heard through the actual folks that do college recon, that the American Legion, actually looking at developing some kind of mechanism to do the to do this kind of ranking, or vet vetting validation of educational institutions out there? Well, I think they've seen that trend as well, that some of these ranking sites seem to tend towards lean towards sponsorship. So in order to inform their own population, you know, of their membership. They were looking at developing some of these mechanisms. There's a program called the veterans Education Project through enlisted association of the National Guard of the United States. I think that this BV, or veterans educational project, is a sub element of that organization. And they're kind of doing the same thing, which actually involved on site visits. And for information embedding, I think the best thing that we can do for our veterans is get them that kind of information, the real fact having have a trusted source of information. So when they're making their educational decisions, they aren't guessing, you know, is this going to is this is this, is this going to work for me? Or is it not going to work for me, I, our, our focus is to provide an educational opportunity for a veteran that fits what they need, if it doesn't fit what they need, then we'll we will try and advise them to, to an organization or an educational institution, that we may even know of that may better fit their needs, we don't want them to attend the University here, if it's if it's not going to benefit them, because like I said, a large chunk of our students are based on referrals from other students. So that's, that's, that's that, you know, word of mouth thing, that's kind of one of our biggest, you know, assets when it comes to identifying new students and educational opportunities. So that's the same methodology, we're taking into this, we want to help the veteran and if the veteran is better served by going to a different university, because they got a program, which they're interested in, and that's where we want them to go. Because we want them to use that gap. I tell the folks here that, you know, the GI Bill, you don't get a refund on that, when you use them, they expect it's gone. And what I want to do is make sure that veteran comes out on the other side of that with the educational product that they they need to do what they want to do in life. That's, that's kind of just Where are my methodology right now?

Unknown Speaker  44:28  
That's fantastic. And that's

Unknown Speaker  44:29  
like, that's, that's good service, like the right kind of service is the service that solves a problem or

Unknown Speaker  44:35  
if there was any way to develop a internal University referral mechanism from for veterans that would be in and we do that informally, right now, when we know of other students, other other universities that take care of veterans. really well. You know, if, if, if like, I just came the that conference was just from Las Vegas, and University of Nevada, Las Vegas has an exceptional Veterans Program over there. Texas a&m is there, they're absolutely amazing. The way they deal with their veterans. It's just one of those ones in it. And if it if if somebody if a veteran fits in, you know, if they can, if they're in that area, and that's the university that they need to go to, then yeah, by all means, I all means go. I encourage it.

Unknown Speaker  45:35  
Good.

Unknown Speaker  45:37  
Well, listen, I know we've gone over time a little bit, I want to let you go if unless you have any other questions for me about the research we're doing or anything that I can, I can help you with you've been a tremendous help to us.

Unknown Speaker  45:51  
Yeah, I just that's what I that's my concern is that, you know, we're brand new, so hopefully we're able to provide that information. If you need any follow up, please let me know. I will.

Unknown Speaker  46:02  
I will. And thanks again. I hope you have a great weekend plant.

Unknown Speaker  46:06  
All right. Thank you very much too. Okay, bye bye. Appreciate it.

## Georgetown University
Unknown Speaker  0:00  
Second. Alright, we're recording. So what we're going to talk about is a little bit about what we talked about with Luke. But we're going to dive into more of the actual process that kind of assume that I don't know anything about your process in terms of, from when a veteran or a service member first contacts, the, your office, all the way through starting to take classes. I want to get a sense of how you manage that process, or what some of the chapter headings are, if it was a book. And most of your answers are going to be based on memory, like, this is what I do when this happens. But if you come across a part of the process that maybe doesn't happen often or hasn't happened yet, you know, your conjecture is totally fine. Okay, we'll talk for about 15 minutes or so. And then we might switch over to the web. How do you start your screen? And I'm just going to ask you to show me some of the things that we talked about. That make sense?

Unknown Speaker  0:58  
Yeah, make sense?

Unknown Speaker  1:00  
Okay, so any questions before we get started?

Unknown Speaker  1:03  
No, I think you've explained the process pretty thoroughly. So I'm ready to go.

Unknown Speaker  1:08  
Awesome. Awesome. So tell me about your work at at the school where you work?

Unknown Speaker  1:14  
Sure. So I oversee our services to support prospective students, current students, and transitioning to alumni were getting into the field of alumni as well, in a more meaningful way, who identify as being military connected. And that includes service members, veterans, military spouses, and children of those serving in the military. And again, we look at it from the cycle life cycle of a students a lot of our engagements. And while our admissions teams are amazingly awesome in terms of the requirements, and knowing the nitty gritty of each of the degree programs, we often work with students, you have specific questions that just you need to understand what it means to be part of the military connected community to answer. So that ranges to you know, I'm a veteran, will that harm me as I'm going through the application process? Or how do I talk about my experience and the application process? To I just want to know, how is it financially feasible. And so we work in hand with the admissions offices to kind of tag team, those areas. And then once a student has been admitted, really providing them kind of a pathway to understand how to navigate the University, the University bureaucracy because we have it too, and then also the bureaucracy if they're using benefits, whether with the Department of Veterans Affairs or with their branch of service.

Unknown Speaker  2:48  
Yes, I am still there. My breaking in and out.

Unknown Speaker  2:51  
Yeah, it could be me, though. Let's, let's give it a minute. And if it doesn't get any better, I'll call in via the phone.

Unknown Speaker  2:57  
Okay, sounds good. I'm one

Unknown Speaker  3:00  
last thing I heard was once admitted, providing them a pathway on how to navigate the university. Yes, something.

Unknown Speaker  3:07  
Yes. So a pathway to navigating the university as well as the Department of Veterans Affairs, or their branch of service, if they're using benefits through their bank branch of service. So I'm, and then, you know, a lot of cases, they, you know, students claim that they don't need support services, and that they got it and good to go. But then also really just saying, you know, here's some, if you've been out of school for a while, here's some resources, both on and off campus to help you. Let's get you connected with other students who are interested or who identify as being military connected, especially for, you know, for students that are in like a grad program, where there's only one other veteran, you know, in the cohort, or things like that, to be able to have that camaraderie. And then we do a lot of Career Services type of an approach. But I'd say probably a good 40% of our job are just explaining how the benefits work. And while you know, I and the team members in my office are not school certifying officials, we support the school certifying official in that regard, and explaining the benefits, because certifying as a full time job. And so answering all the questions and things like that, that we can just answer on their behalf. We do play a significant role in awesome. So

Unknown Speaker  4:24  
yeah, that's pretty much it. In a nutshell.

Unknown Speaker  4:27  
That's great. So roughly about how many people in that audience we talked about veterans, anyone, current students, who identifies military service members and their children, how many per semester is the whole group working with, like, roughly?

Unknown Speaker  4:45  
Sure. Um, so on all of our campuses, we have our main campus or School of Continuing Studies, our Law Center and School of Medicine, we have 1200, military connected students of that popular. So that's within an academic year, I'd say on average, in a semester, we have probably close to 800 900 at a time. And of that population of 1200, and an academic year about, I'd say, close to 80% are using benefits.

Unknown Speaker  5:22  
Awesome, thank you for the breakdown.

Unknown Speaker  5:26  
So let's walk through the process like a veteran or a military connected person comes to you. And tell me like how they connect with your office first. And then let's walk through kind of any, any of the big steps they go through to getting to class. And if there's any parts of the process, where you have a touch point with the Department of Veterans Affairs, I definitely want to kind of dive into that a little bit more.

Unknown Speaker  5:55  
Sure. So I'd say it's to do read pathways that students connect with our office. One, they literally just google our school name, and veterans, and then they find our website, and then they reach out indicating that they have you know, they're interested in applying and have questions about the application process, or how to use benefits and so forth.

Unknown Speaker  6:18  
What do they? How do they reach out they find your website? And then is there a behavior specifically that they do?

Unknown Speaker  6:24  
either call or email?

Unknown Speaker  6:27  
Yeah, occasionally we'll get walk ins, um,

Unknown Speaker  6:33  
just because of the location of where school is, I think people just have that accessibility, but majority of the time, it's just calling or emailing our office.

Unknown Speaker  6:41  
Is it more of one of the other is about 5050?

Unknown Speaker  6:45  
I'd say it's about 5050. Okay, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  6:48  
And what was the second way

Unknown Speaker  6:51  
that the prospective student will reach out to admissions and then they'll self identify their connection to the military, and then the admissions office will do a soft handoff or provide them our contact information and indicate that you know, if they have specific questions pertaining to their military connection, that we're a resource for them as well. And so that's another way I can't tell you exactly how many students take them up on that offer. But we have seen, you know, the connection email where the admissions advisor will say, you know, we're connecting the veterans office to you so that way, you know, you have questions, you can connect with them now. I'd say more often than not, though, most of our connections, we are the first touch points before admissions.

Unknown Speaker  7:39  
Gotcha. So they kind of Google, Georgetown, and veterans, they find your site they call you, and then you walk them into the admissions process. Figuratively speaking, right? Correct. Okay, so let's, let's go with that flow. So when when you kind of, what do you do with them before you hand them off to admissions? And then what is the handoff look like?

Unknown Speaker  8:04  
Sure. So we first try to get a sense as to what their questions are. And we're up front with them. We, you know, we have oodles of programs on our campuses. So while we may not know the ins and the outs of some of the admissions process questions, depending on the nature of the question, we can either answer the question in house, in addition to connecting them to admissions, or it's just, you know, like hands down, we're going to have to connect it to an admissions advisor, because we don't know the answer to that question. Or we would feel more comfortable having that answer come from their office. So that way we we ensure that the students getting the correct information. So if it's, you know, a benefit related question, we can definitely answer those questions and explaining so a lot of it in terms of the benefits question, you know, I'm eligible for this, you know, how much will that get me into terms of coverage if I were to enroll in your degree program. And so then we'll walk them through how the benefit pays out, there's a lot of caveats in the conversation, because one we don't, we're not the VA, we're basing this on the information that the student is providing us at the time. we're basing it on what the tuition rates are in that current year. So if they're looking for a future academic year, everything is up in the air. So and students are pretty open to that they understand that, that we're just trying to give them a ballpark figure based upon the information. And then in the event that we in that walkthrough. realize, you know, there's still a delta, in terms of coverage for tuition benefits will connect them to resources for internal and external scholarship opportunities. And I'm trying to think of the other ones, and depending on the program that they're applying to, we will also connect them to resources external tuning university that helped with the admissions process, such as service to school warrior scholar project, and since our office tries to remain neutral in the admissions process, because you know, we don't want to give light or give the impression that by engaging with our office that's guaranteeing enrollments of any case. So we rely on those external resources to kind of help with you know, looking specifically at an an application package. If they have specific questions about essays or you know, how they're answering admissions. The other thing that we often do in this process to is, we offer the opportunity to connect the prospective student with a current students. And that allows, again, kind of the similar number of current students like to volunteer Yeah, read your essays, or, you know, I'll take a look at your application package as well. So it removes us from that process, as you know, an administrator of the university. And then it also allows the opportunity to for the prospective student and the current student to have a meaningful conversation of what it means to attend our institution. We can talk all day what that looks like. But I think it's a whole other meaning when it's coming from a pure student. So that's pretty much what it looks like holistically. And then as soon as you know, if the prospective student indicates that they have specific questions about the application process, or the degree program itself, then because I can't guarantee that the student wants to self disclose their military connection, I'll ask the the prospective students. So here's the point of contact within the admissions program or within the program itself, you're welcome to reach out to them directly. Or if you would like me to make a connection email, I'd be more than happy to do so or make a connection in some capacity. Most students are open to us doing the the connection, but there have been times where the student says that they would prefer to take it upon themselves. And so we like to give them that ownership. Because if I'm making a connection, it's pretty clear why they are and we take the opportunity for students to self disclose their connection to the military pretty seriously, because that is something that they're entitled to make that decision.

Unknown Speaker  12:23  
Okay, so if I'm following, and I'm taking notes, so I'm probably a little behind. If it sounds like I'm not responding, it's just me catching up.

Unknown Speaker  12:33  
That's okay.

Unknown Speaker  12:35  
When so there's a process by which you've made this connection, if the admissions process is happening in a specific school, or you know, in the business school at the health, school medicine, they have the option of disclosing their their military connection, you know, you let them know that that's their decision. What are their interests of steps, once they've kind of made contact and applied through to if they're accepted, or if they're not accepted, any other conversations or support that you provide through either of those outcomes?

Unknown Speaker  13:17  
There have been cases, when a student has not been admitted that they'll reach out asking for feedback, since we're not a part of the admissions process will have to refer them to the admissions office itself. But there has been at least a case or two that I've known where admissions and our office will tag team in terms of providing feedback, because the student was looking from it from that perspective of you know, I did all these things in the military, I thought it was, you know, um, that would be, you know, not necessarily a plus one, but it would be understood as to why I would be a good candidate for the admissions process. And so we had to work together gather as you, yes, those are all great things. But here's where, you know, from holistically where the admissions office was looking for things, and these are the touch points for you to build on. And it was taken well, and in this particular cases, I say, once a student has been admitted, yes, like, we're in that we start that phase all the way back in, I feel like February or March, and we're still catching up where a student has been admitted. And they're really gung ho about getting their benefits situated and ready to go, when we're still in the middle of that semester. So we're like, oh, we're not ready yet. So we do engage in that capacity. That's a lot of where they will reach back out once they've been admitted. Um, the other thing that we launched last academic year is, right now we're in the process of streamlining that the questions are consistent across all of our schools asking about military connected, so they can do that. So one of the areas that we wanted to work on is, once a student or prospective students starts the application process, they can indicate their military connected process, or connection, and then admissions will pull a reports to flat like, essentially get all of those students that check to Yes. And then an email will be sent to them saying, we noticed that you check that you were connected to the military. Did you know that we have a veterans office on campus, if you know if you have specific questions, here's their contact information. Ironically, a lot of folks did not email the specific questions, but they did, right being like, this is awesome. Like, they were very positive about that feedback. Just knowing that we were there to assist with any questions. And then once they did learn that they got admitted, they knew right off the bat, where to go. And so instead of like, feeling, you know, do I go to admissions or go to financial aid? Do I go to the registrar's office, and so they had that central point of contact already initiated from the start? So, um, so that's been a really positive outcome that we've noticed, as this is our second year rolling that out, that we've gotten from students who did self identify in the application process.

Unknown Speaker  16:27  
Awesome. So

Unknown Speaker  16:31  
what are some of the most common or difficult challenges that you encounter? When you see you're supporting this, this constituency, through the school application processes, not necessarily the benefits part, but just like that admissions piece, we talked a little bit about it. And I think it's interesting, you know, when someone isn't admitted how you either facilitate or provide feedback, but you know, what, are there any other really common questions during the application process to the to a school?

Unknown Speaker  17:07  
Yes, um, is the application fee waived? Is

Unknown Speaker  17:13  
our essay T's or dare is required, if I have X amount of experience? at the undergraduate level, one of the top questions that we often get is, you know, I've been out of school for umpteen years is this, especially if they're applying as a first year student? Are these requirements of you know, feedback from a high school guidance counselor required? But I mean, more often than not many of our veterans apply as transfer students. So the process is a little bit different. But then that leads to the next question, do I apply as a first year student versus a transfer students? trying to think of the other ones that we get? And then they the another question, um, in terms of admissions, that we've had some fine lines, walking is a, you know, admissions is often asking for lists of current students who self identify, and if the student doesn't self identify, either through admissions or through the university, because there's another touch point that students can self identify, but only self identifies because they're using benefits, I can't share that information. Because, again, we're giving that in that opportunity for the student to self disclose. So there's been times where admissions is doing like, we'll do like a military specific admissions events for a program and they want to have current students attend, and they, you know, try to push out that information. So that's an area where, you know, we have to walk a fine line as to when do we start close someone's connection to the military versus not when not all the data belongs to admissions? I'm trying to think of other ones that we get. But I'd say those are probably the top questions we get that's not benefits related. Um, I guess the other one that we sometimes occasionally get is how does the admissions committee factor in my military experience? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  19:33  
yeah. So with the first year versus transfer question, is that usually related to Joint Service credits? Or, like, what kind of what kind of things come up in that first year versus transfer?

Unknown Speaker  19:46  
Yeah, so definitely just your institution except military credits. Um, I, you know, students who took classes at online institutions that may not align with the academic mission of our institution, how do we accept those? Do we accept those? A lot of times, it's the question of I was a really bad student in high school, or I attempted college the first time around and was awful. And then I joined the military. And then here's my academic record today, and it's much better. So those are the types of questions that we get. But yes, I would say a lot of it does come down to does your institution accepts military credit or clip tests? And how does that you know, put me in terms of do I apply as a first year student versus a transfer student? You said, clip tests, what are those clip tests are offered through the College Board. And they are free for service members to complete. And the College Board would really scold me because I can't remember what club stands for. But essentially, it's kind of like you take a test, there's subject matters that you can take a test for, if you decide that you want to study for excellent, you know, for the subject in two weeks and take the test in a sense, that can apply as credit for some institutions. It's very, it's kind of the equivalent of, you know, kind of like AP Tet or AP classes, and how there's test scores with that. So instead of going through an entire semesters worth of class, you can, you know, study on it on your own, take the test, and then if you do well on it, the institution could decide to accept that, yep, you are well versed in the subject matter. So we'll accept X amount of credits for that.

Unknown Speaker  21:45  
Thank you,

Unknown Speaker  21:48  
a common or difficult questions and challenges for benefit application processes that you help facilitate? Or you know, just tell me kind of like, is that something that people come to you for, you know, just what kind of stuff comes up in terms of supporting VA benefit applications.

Unknown Speaker  22:08  
So the there's probably at least two or three that I can think of off the top my head, we have two application routes for admissions or to application prep process processes for undergraduate students. That's what I'm trying to say. And one, in one of our, you know, our largest undergraduate programs that are offered through that application track, the tuition is different than the tuition for the other undergraduate program. So because of how to wish in a structured as well as what the Yellow Ribbon Program rates are, and that's where things get sticky, because one program is covered in full with post 911 and yellow ribbon, and then our other the process for undergraduate students is not. And so having to explain for the school, the schools that are not covered in full, were need blind institution, and this is how scholarships are issued. So while Yellow Ribbon may not cover everything, you may or may not be eligible for scholarships, and it's just confusing for the students. It just really is confusing. So that's an area that has struggled and then it often raises questions of will, why is one area of your institution covered in full and another one not? And so then I'm having to also market the institution and with, you know, politically, while explaining the differences to prospective students, so that's always a challenge. And there was another Oh, the other one that in terms of benefits that gets tricky, is do I use post 911 vs. Vocational Rehabilitation benefits? We occasionally get other types of benefits. You know, questions like do I use post 911, or Montgomery GI Bill? And I think that's easier to explain. But for chapter 33, and 31, that one's a tough one. for undergraduates, I think it's a little bit more easier for us to explain the differences in the pathways for doing it. But for graduate students, it's a lot more nuanced, since I'm chapter 31 VRNE. Benefits are you know, that's to get gainful employment. And so if you already have an undergraduate degree, we advise students, it may take a little bit longer to justify to the VR any counselor why you need a master's degree to be gainfully employed, specifically, why are you getting a master's degree at a high cost institution. So that that becomes it's just, we just want students to make a well informed decision because in some cases, the admissions timeline, there's like, a student can apply. And by the time they find out, they've been admitted, there's really a short window of time to get your benefits situated before there's before classes started. Start. So I think that's an area where, you know, it gets a little bit challenging where we're being, we're being realistic in terms of the timelines for our students to know, you know, the differences between those two benefits. And then the last one where benefits become tricky is, and this is more along the lines, once a student has been admitted, this comes up, I'd say maybe once or twice a semester, is a student in the admissions process applies for benefits with the VA, they get a certificate of eligibility letter indicating that they are hundred percent eligible for post 911 benefits. They get enrolled, we go to certify them that first term before semester begins. And then the VA gets updated information from the Department of Defense to indicate that the student really isn't 100% eligible for benefits. And that's a shockwave. I mean, in a lot of cases, they felt that they were getting 100%, post 911 benefits and yellow ribbon and then now they're not. So how are they figuring out how they're going to finance their education. So that's another one that comes up where in the admissions process when a student is asking questions about, well, what's my cost of tuition, we're pre, you know, forthcoming, like, if you did an ROTC scholarship, or if you went to a service Academy, or did loan repayments, just make sure that you have all that information on file with the VA, because the VA needs to know that information in order to better you know, accurately

Unknown Speaker  26:53  
assess what your eligibility is, and that will, you know, be a game changer in terms of how much you're eligible receive. So I think those are the three benefits, questions or areas in terms of the application process that we get that that take a lot of time. But

Unknown Speaker  27:15  
what if you don't mind me asking? And I know, we're kind of coming up on time here. But I'm going to, I want to try to get through all these questions, because there's a lot of really good examples here. What leads to that circumstance, that's, you know, in terms of a percentage, it's less than half of a percent of the time or even a quarter of a percent of the time, where they get a certificate of eligibility. And then it's revoked, essentially? Uh, huh. Do you have a sense of how that happens? And it might be all on the VA side? I don't know. But

Unknown Speaker  27:48  
yeah, I'll actually give the VA the benefit of the doubt on this. It's more on the communication between the VA and the DOD. And what ends up happening a lot of times, so I think the Loan Repayment Program, the VA definitely has that up to up to date. But what often trips up that process is if the student did ROTC at a scholarship, or and got a scholarship, for whatever reason, the branch of service may not be communicating that to the VA, and then or it's not as easily accessible when initially applies for benefits. And then a more thorough investigation happens once the certification has been submitted, I can't necessarily know behind the details. Explain to me it's just an information gap. Um, the other case that often comes up from time to time are for those that are who are in the reserves. And what the Yes, I am. Can you hear me?

Unknown Speaker  28:55  
Yeah, I'm all cut up. You said the other case that happens from time to time

Unknown Speaker  29:00  
is when the service member was in the reserves. And what the VA originally was tracking in terms of, you know, eligible time to accrue towards days of service, actually was training time or something like that. And so they didn't, the student didn't actually assess the amount of days needed to become eligible at 100% for post 911. So that's another area that has come up. But again, that's a communication piece between the VA and the DOD.

Unknown Speaker  29:32  
Yeah, thank you.

Unknown Speaker  29:34  
Between the beauty

Unknown Speaker  29:39  
couple of closing questions, and then if we have time, I might want to look at one website. How do you feel about veterans providing online feedback about the school that you work at? Like their websites, like nice calm and other good public forums where veterans can provide feedback? Do you guys pay attention to that kind of feedback?

Unknown Speaker  30:04  
We don't, but I think the way I feel about it is I value feedback. So that way, we can enhance and strengthen our services. And there have been cases where students will write us an email or send us a call or tell us, you know, in person, through our student organization, you know, we're really looking for this, and we'll tweak our services or our approach to things to meet that feedback, because it's valid. So I definitely don't want to silence veterans or military connected students as they're going through the experience. I will know that in a lot of cases, the feedback or experience, or, you know, feedback that we get from service members, I think are just misaligned expectations. And so, um, how we balance that, I think, is the biggest challenge in terms of some of those forums where, you know, people can complain about, you know, the timeliness of being certified or the timeliness of getting information. Um, you know, for us, I mean, I feel like, we're pretty good in terms of timeliness and, you know, providing accurate information. But where, where I've seen, like, for example, on Facebook's, um, the post 911 page that they have, and reading through the comments, and a lot of the feedback is, you know, I haven't gotten my benefits. And why is the VA taking so long? And then, you know, there's cases where that's because the student didn't follow the protocol of the university in terms of requesting to be certified. So finding that balance of, you know, how do we meaningfully capture feedback from students who went through the process to know kind of like what we're doing here today of going through the process? From a holistic perspective, where were the gaps that took place or miss under stood information or misaligned of expectations? So we can either strengthen the process or do a better job of communicating what's the services and the roles and responsibilities for lack of better term of each of the parties to play a role in the admissions or the certification process, whatever the case might be?

Unknown Speaker  32:26  
responsible for each step?

Unknown Speaker  32:29  
On what websites other than other than your.edu site? Are there any other sites that you distribute to your constituents as authoritative sites on information about your school?

Unknown Speaker  32:46  
So there's one that I know too, I think there's two. So I think when we last chatted, I mentioned Columbia University's the transition. Veteran transition, I'm blanking on the full name of it, but they did in higher education. Institute of Higher Education, interactive map. And so we have information listed there, which is undergraduate focused, that we provided information to have our explaining, you know, we have a veterans office, this is what our tuition rates are, and things like that. And then the other one that's out there that we provided information for is college recon. And so they pulled a lot of the information on their own from public data sources, very similar to the GI Bill comparison tool. But then we had the opportunity to be like, actually, there's some incorrect information in there, how do we update it, and they provide us provided us the opportunity to make those edits. And then I guess, actually, there's a third through the Department of Defense, because we have an MMO, you with them for tuition assistance there. DTA decide we enter in all that information in terms of what our tuition rates are, what programs we offer, and so forth. So that is listed there as well. I think that's it that I know of,

Unknown Speaker  34:19  
Okay, um, for college recon and TA decide, can you make those changes at any time? Or is it like, there's a window of time to make those changes? Every, you know, so often? Or how does that work?

Unknown Speaker  34:31  
Um, so we can make them at any time. I'm trying to think if we make them at any time, at what point does it go live? Is it live right off the spot, or if it has to get reviewed, and then it gets posted, but essentially, we can go in and make make those changes, and then eventually, it gets updated. So it's not like we have to go to a third party. Like, for example, we had a case where our Yellow Ribbon Program rates on the VA, his website was listed incorrectly for one of our schools. So we had to email the Yellow Ribbon Program Office and asked for them to change it, and it took them forever to change it. So it's not like one of those processes, I'd say it's pretty quick, in terms of getting that information updated.

Unknown Speaker  35:14  
Gotcha. Um, so any other websites where you verify or, or, you know, update information? Other than those three?

Unknown Speaker  35:24  
Yeah, I think that's it, I can think of, Okay, awesome.

Unknown Speaker  35:27  
Well, Tell, tell me, do you have like another five minutes to just kind of look at something really quick?

Unknown Speaker  35:33  
So do you?

Unknown Speaker  35:34  
What I'd love to do is if you could share your screen with me. Okay. Go ahead. I know your zoom. You guys are so I won't walk you through it.

Unknown Speaker  35:46  
Share a quote on its entire screen? Yes. Can you just do it? Please? It's acting funny.

Unknown Speaker  35:58  
All right.

Unknown Speaker  36:03  
There we go. Okay, there we go.

Unknown Speaker  36:06  
Awesome. So what I'd like you to do is in a new tab, just go to go to the comparison tool on va.gov.

Unknown Speaker  36:21  
I'm just gonna do this.

Unknown Speaker  36:29  
I find google it enough that my computer nowhere to go. So.

Unknown Speaker  36:33  
And what I'd like you to do is just pull up the most commonly used campus, like the one that you would be the most likely to send a student profile you'd be the most likely to send a student to. And I just want to take a look at that page with you and ask you a couple of questions.

Unknown Speaker  37:00  
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  37:02  
So if when you look at this page, and kind of scroll through the information, what I'd like to do is here, as you're looking at this page and thinking about the conversations that you've had with veterans and their children and active duty, folks and reservists, what are the things that jumped out as Oh, this is something that they often inquire about, or they have questions about, and what are some of the things that you find? Like, Oh, I wish we could update this? Or I'm not sure if this is correct.

Unknown Speaker  37:37  
Hmm. So the one that we probably get the most about is the housing allowance rates. Especially if a student is going part time versus full time.

Unknown Speaker  37:57  
And

Unknown Speaker  38:02  
when you were in transition, so essentially, here's like a window of time. So like, we are like, for example, in April or May. And that time of year, a lot of people are finding out that they've been admitted to the University at that time, and the post 911 to wishin rate is for the current academic year, but doesn't have information for the upcoming academic year. So then they have questions. Well, is this rate correct? Like, how much am I actually getting? Because at no point, does it say on here, what academic year this is for. So for example, this break the 24 fours for 24 477 is for the 2019 20 academic year, but when we get into April, or may of 2020 students who were starting in the 2021 academic year, this was is now outdated.

Unknown Speaker  39:03  
We get a lot of questions about that.

Unknown Speaker  39:06  
And the other one that we get all lot abouts and may have to fill this out. Hold on one second. Let me see if I can get it. Are you will you be Yes, I will be his yellow ribbon. So for example, this defaulted to one of our trying to watch my language because I know you were trying not to do school stuff. So um, it defaults to a school that has the higher Yellow Ribbon Program, right? And we'll be honest, our students don't know the difference. Like, it's hard for them to know, like, Where does my program actually fall under. And so but if you, you know, the student where to go and actually know where it falls, it changes the Yellow Ribbon Program rate drastically. So you know, walking them through knowing where the degree program falls, so that way they can accurately pull

Unknown Speaker  40:09  
the correct Yellow Ribbon Program rates. The other interesting piece?

Unknown Speaker  40:18  
Yeah, um, what school is missing? There's a school missing here. Yeah. Is not all our school are listed here.

Unknown Speaker  40:30  
Okay, so, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  40:32  
Cool. Anything else further on down the page, feel free to kind of look the whole length of the page. If there's anything else that jumps out at you as things that come up in conversation with students or things that you're, you're noticing, oh, this isn't quite right. Or this isn't what we tell students?

Unknown Speaker  40:51  
Yeah, I mean, this scholarship one is confusing. I don't understand what this means. So I'm back to do undergraduate, like, is this assuming that the student puts in the scholarship? So that's one of those odd ones where I'm just like, I don't know what I'm putting here? Um,

Unknown Speaker  41:15  
yeah, that's normal. I'm

Unknown Speaker  41:21  
I would say, that's pretty much it. This one is also confusing is that let's go back up to let's make this graduate. And it's still lists that not available on this campus online only. So again, that's one of those areas that we will advise them actually we do. I'm also the vet success on campus, which if that's v sock, while we don't have one, that's because we're in the queue. That's, you know, a gazillion schools long that we requested one. So if, you know, trying to explain to students, yes, I see this is very cut and dry as to whether or not we have it or not, but there's nuances there. And then Luke knows me very well about the student outcomes. And that's just more of a pain point. From a university perspective. I'll be honest, I don't think students are really looking at this. So

Unknown Speaker  42:23  
hello, again, here. Hello.

Unknown Speaker  42:28  
busted. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  42:31  
Well, I was going to tell you, one of the things that came out of one of the scope conferences this summer was, can we just hide that data? Like until we figure out what we're going to do with it, it's causing more trouble than it's worth right now?

Unknown Speaker  42:42  
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. But I'll be honest, to get to, you know, what students asked about it I have yet ever to get a student to ask me at all, like, what are those student outcomes? What are the graduation rates? Like ever? Yeah. Which is surprising, because I know that there are organizations out there like service to school warrior scholar project that do educate people on having service members look at that information. I don't know if that's, I feel like I should know this. Because tap just redid the curriculum for education. If that's come up there, and potentially we could get more questions about it. But thus far, I've never had anybody asked me that in all my years of being in this field.

Unknown Speaker  43:32  
And how many years is that? I want to ask you that? Have you been working in this field? and other schools? Or have you been at the school the whole time? The whole time?

Unknown Speaker  43:40  
Other schools? I'm so I fell into this world.

Unknown Speaker  43:47  
What was it? 2010? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  43:53  
Nine years?

Unknown Speaker  43:54  
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  43:56  
Just say,

Unknown Speaker  43:59  
nine years experience. Awesome. Um, that's it. Those are all the questions that I have. And I know we're a little bit over time. Do you have any other questions for me today?

Unknown Speaker  44:09  
No, I think that is pretty much it, I think you I really appreciate appreciated you asking the questions of when they're still prospective students, and then once they've gotten admitted, because I think that that's really crucial in a lot of these conversations, to different users. Um, and so while it could be the same user, I think the lens point that they're approaching it is different. So I just wanted to provide that feedback. I'm grateful that you are looking at it from that angle. But I think that pretty much covers it. I don't have any questions at this point.

Unknown Speaker  44:48  
Okay, awesome. I, you know, I have I know, you're not an SEO, but I know that, that you probably are often, you know, part of the SEO company. Have you ever thought about whether or not that would be better if it was done digitally, as opposed to physically?

Unknown Speaker  45:10  
What part of this will sir SEO

Unknown Speaker  45:12  
really just certifying veteran status and you know, what they're eligible for? Because right now, it's done physically with a letter. And I was just curious, like, if I said, if I said, if we could provide a digital certification? I don't there's a lot of different ways that could work. I'm just curious what, you know, if we said, and I'm not saying this, but if we said the VA is considering a process for digitally certifying eligibility, how, what what comes to mind?

Unknown Speaker  45:42  
Oh, yes, I think that was been promised, since I first started certifying, I used to be a school certifying official back when I was in 2010. So, um, and I think there has been talk that we would be able to see a student’s eligible and VA once

Unknown Speaker  46:03  
at some point, but that’s assuming that the student has been admitted into your institution. So I guess it gets a little bit tricky of at what points can school see that information? If they’re still a prospective student versus a current students? Um, but yes, I think once a student has been admitted to the institution, it would be that would save a lot of time, as long as the what we’re seeing is live and active. So if there’s any changes, so like, for example, what often comes up is how many months of eligibility Do I have remaining? And so are there is there enough eligibility in terms of length of time to get the students through the semester or not? And that’s one of those areas that we need the information to be live to best provide that student the information as to

Unknown Speaker  46:57  
they need other forms of finances to cover those costs.

Unknown Speaker  47:03  
Okay, well, thank you. And thanks for taking the time this morning. I appreciate it. And I’m sorry that we went over a little bit. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  47:09  
Okay. Good conversation. So I talked a lot to

Unknown Speaker  47:12  
No worries. I, I hope you have a good day, kind of mixing the the work in the home and getting stuff done. And I’m sure we’ll be in touch again, since you and Luke are such good friends.

Unknown Speaker  47:26  
Yeah, no happy to connect. And if you have any other follow up questions, just let me know. And I’m happy to help and whatever capacity

Unknown Speaker  47:35  
There we go. Yeah. Well, have a great day and I’ll talk to you soon.

Unknown Speaker  47:41  
Sounds good. All right. Take care. Okay, bye bye. I

Or to the cloud?

Unknown Speaker  0:03  
All right, we should be recording now.

Unknown Speaker  0:08  
Did you hear a recording message? I just want to make sure you did.

Unknown Speaker  0:12  
No, but I see the little red thing

Unknown Speaker  0:16  
that says it's recording on my phone as well. So what I'd like to do is just kind of learn from you about the different kinds of behaviors and tools you use in supporting veterans and their beneficiaries and their educational goals. And I want to get a sense of the whole process. So some of the stuff may be based on like, memory or understanding of what your team has done in the past. And some of it might be based on like, we might show you a website that you haven't seen before. And you'd be like, well, this is how I might use this. We'll talk for about 15 minutes, just so we can kind of get to know the process, and how kind of specific parts of the process. And then we'll switch over to kind of sharing your screen. And I'll ask you, I'll say, okay, when you're talking to a veteran about this issue, what kind of ways do you use the GW website to solve that problem? Or the VA website? If that's the case? Does that make sense? Yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:14  
Cool. So tell me, tell me about how long you've been at GW.

Unknown Speaker  1:20  
So I've been a staff member for three and a half years, but actually worked in this office as a VA work study during my during my undergrad. So I've been here at GW in total capacity is like both students and staff for seven years.

Unknown Speaker  1:39  
Awesome. So you came in as a veteran taking advantage of benefits at UW?

Unknown Speaker  1:45  
Actually, I transferred entitlement My dad is an Air Force, but got it. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:51  
Um, so roughly about how many veterans or service members is your school working with each semester? Like it does need to be precise, just like a random, not random, rough range.

Unknown Speaker  2:05  
So you, we look at it holistically. So total military affiliated student population, which does include dependence, reservists, etc. Roxy, is about 1800.

Unknown Speaker  2:18  
Did you say that includes dependence as well?

Unknown Speaker  2:20  
Yes, if you're just our veteran and active duty slash reservist population is roughly two thirds of that. So about 1200 students, and every semester, we certify about 1000 to 1100, using GI Bill benefits, that doesn't count those just using TAT.

Unknown Speaker  2:49  
Got it? So let's walk through the process. Like if you were going to imagine, you had to write a book about the end to end process of when you first get in touch with potential students to when they start taking classes. What what are the chapter titles of those of each step in the process.

Unknown Speaker  3:09  
So first is identifying our students beforehand, we tried to capture them once they've applied and been admitted. We work with the admissions office to see which students have self identified as military affiliated so that we can proactively reach out to them. What we do have a welcome letter template that introduces who our office is like what kind of services we offer, and how to get started on using their benefits, if they so choose. One of the main points of that is our Admitted Student checklist, which goes through how to contact you guys at the VA to you know, if they've never used benefits before how to apply how to request a certificate of eligibility, and then the different things we need from them at GW in order to process and certify their benefits. Gotcha.

Unknown Speaker  3:59  
And then once,

Unknown Speaker  4:01  
like, so you send them proactively a letter is that a print letter or an email or both?

Unknown Speaker  4:08  
As an email, and once we have their digital contact information, we also add them to our weekly newsletter, the dog tags. And we use that both as like a policy advisory. So like reminder, don't forget to request certification for fall 2019. But also like, posting about like events going around, both at GW and in DC and like veteran community internship and job postings, all that kind of stuff.

Unknown Speaker  4:36  
Gotcha. And if you don't mind me asking, do you know what you use to send that newsletter out? That's an email newsletter. So yeah, we use that helps. Thank you. So um, so let's say, I get I'm a student, I am military affiliated, I get that welcome letter. welcome letter has that checklist? I, let's say what's the more likely thing to happen next? Do I reach out to you and say, I need help with this checklist? Or do I reach out to you say, I've done the checklist?

Unknown Speaker  5:14  
Sometimes it's, it varies case by case. We in that welcome letter, we also list our orientations that we hold in the fall for incoming students, and like what those dates and times are. So sometimes students will wait and come to the orientation and ask their questions then, or they'll reach out to us by phone or email or drop by to our office to ask questions. Sometimes students reach out to us proactively before they're even admitted, like if they're on like a school tour. So it really just varies by case when they reach out to us next.

Unknown Speaker  5:48  
And that's kind of

Unknown Speaker  5:50  
based on like the student and how well prepared and knowledgeable they are about the process. Like we have a decent portion of transfer students who may have user benefits, like at NOVA, for example, or UMD, they're transferring to GW and so they they understand the basics, and they just need to know like, what's the GW process, specifically?

Unknown Speaker  6:10  
What are what are GW specifics that are maybe different from other schools or GW requirements for administering this process.

Unknown Speaker  6:20  
So we do require proof of benefits, usually a certificate of eligibility, especially if students want to participate in our Yellow Ribbon Program.

Unknown Speaker  6:32  
Because we need to verify their eligibility for it.

Unknown Speaker  6:36  
So once we have a recent proof of benefits on file, they have to request certification every semester, it's an online form. It's in the same portal that they register for classes. So it's super accessible, and takes all of about a minute to fill out. But it just gives us like, their demographic information, like are they you know, active duty Marine Corps or, you know, Coast Guard, reservist, whatever, and then what chapter is benefit to us. So that we, we have their consent, essentially, to submit their Enrollment Verification to the VA.

Unknown Speaker  7:08  
Okay. So this is the consent to submit enrollments,

Unknown Speaker  7:15  
right? We do have some students who try who strategically use their benefits and financial aid, maybe use their GI Bill one semester, but not the next. So we rely on students to tell us when they want to use their benefits.

Unknown Speaker  7:30  
See, that makes sense. So once you've gotten the form at the beginning of a semester from them, what does that forum called? Does it have any

Unknown Speaker  7:42  
requests for certification? Just for certification?

Unknown Speaker  7:47  
So you get that forum from them? Is there a Is there a workflow to what you need to do on the on for your team? To submit the moment verification? Like, tell me what your slow is for that?

Unknown Speaker  8:01  
Sure. So um, every night, the database sends us an email with what new requests are submitted the day before. So we integrate those into a running spreadsheet for the semester, we check to make sure we have everyone's documentation on file, like, do we have a certificate of eligibility on file? Do we need an updated one? Do we have their social security number on file? If they're missing any of those items, we can we put them on a separate list and email them letting them know that we need X, Y, or Z. If they have everything on file, they go on our certification list. And actually, right now, for example, where we do a two step certification process at GW. So right now we're in the zero cert submission phase where we submit students enrollment, their credits dates, but not their tuition, we intentionally the tuition figures at zero. And then after the Add drop period, and which is about three weeks into the term, we go back and we double check everyone's enrollment information. And at that point, submit the tuition and fees to the auction. So I want to confirm this because this is interesting. This is something I haven't heard from another school before, and you're one of the first three or four people we've spoken with. So this might be good. Yeah, it is a process by the VA. And we find it helpful because it prevents tuition fees going back and forth. Like if a student decides to change their class schedule or whatever, they totally have that prerogative. And it just makes it easier for everyone else if you know, we're not sending debts back and forth. Because right there, they're changing their class schedule.

Unknown Speaker  9:32  
Yeah. So I'm just I reflect this back, I want to make sure I have this right. In my notes. There's a zero certification submission phase, where you submit the everything except the tuition amount, and that's zero. And then after the drop period, do you just add the tuition to that certification submission? Or do you submit a second certification submission?

Unknown Speaker  9:56  
if nothing's change, like they're in the same class at the same time to the same credits, we just add the tuition. But it's also like a checkpoint for us to see, you know, did they add another class or drop a class? Yeah. And then we submit any of those changes with the tuition at that time?

Unknown Speaker  10:13  
Yeah, cuz the tuition would obviously change. Got it.

Unknown Speaker  10:15  
Right. So what,

Unknown Speaker  10:17  
and then I'm assuming that's it, that's the end of the process in terms of administering the benefit, or are there follow on processes that you guys have to do?

Unknown Speaker  10:26  
Well, like, for example, we administer their payments, once they arrived from the VA, we work with our student accounts office on that. So we help put those payments on the appropriate account, we manage the yellow ribbon funds. So we're kind of the liaison, and we, you know, send it out to all the budget heads and be like, this is your list of students that need yellow and matches, and they need it in this amount. We also keep We also run regular reports on students enrollment to see if they've added or dropped classes, somewhere in the middle of the term. GW has a very, I don't want to say last, because that sounds, you know, negligent in some way, but they they very forgiving withdrawal policy where students can withdraw very late in the term. Yeah, so we run those reports, pretty constantly to make sure that we're up to date on what students are actually taking.

Unknown Speaker  11:15  
Yeah, I remember when I was in school a long time ago.

Unknown Speaker  11:19  
Like there was a very unforgiving policy at my school, like you had until two weeks. And that was it. You know, so that's, that's interesting. I could see how that would affect obviously, the benefit administration. And the other. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  11:34  
go ahead. Um, we also one of the things we do that that is now mandated, but it's finally we're doing anyway, is we protect students from late fees and finance charges while they wait for their VA payment. So if they're receiving any chapter 33 benefit, or vocational rehabilitation benefits are waived from any late fees, finance charges, registration holds any of that kind of stuff. And we put because GW knows that the funds are not going to arrive by the first day of class, like for a normal students, that's their payment due date. So we protect them from being penalized for funds that they're not responsible for, essentially, gotcha. We also have to report academic progress, like if a student, you know, it's not doing great, and their GPA drops too low or whatever, that's part of the SEO process as well. At the end of the report, anyone was not doing so great academically.

Unknown Speaker  12:37  
So it's only at the end of the semester, it's not ongoing.

Unknown Speaker  12:42  
Right? Yeah. Cuz they look at the Yeah, we do it once a semester, because of students previous performance, performance that in previous semester is what determines their current status. So if they failed other classes and fall than their spring status, could be on warning denial. Got it?

Unknown Speaker  13:05  
So what are some of the most common or difficult challenges? When you're working with a veteran or a veterans beneficiary? During specifically the school application process? I don't mean the benefit application process, but the application process that for acceptance to the school, that I'm assuming you, you know, coach them through or provide them with answers if they have questions. So this is kind of prior to the beginning of the process that you described, you know, are there are there challenges that come up often for this, this group

Unknown Speaker  13:40  
can be honest, we don't have

Unknown Speaker  13:43  
GW doesn't have any, like special admittance procedures for military affiliated students. Part of it is because the GW admissions is very decentralized. Each school has, like their own policies, procedures. Sometimes they'll waive, like the deposit for military students upon request. But as for like, admissions, we don't get too many questions. God is really good about publicizing deadlines and things like that. So I think the one that I think students nauseous, because they're unsure, especially if they've been in the military a while is like, you know, I haven't been to college before I have been serving for the last six years, you know, will not reflect poorly. And our answer is No job is really good about looking at experience as like its own education in a way. And so I wouldn't say that, like military students are unfairly disadvantaged at all in the admissions process, just because, you know, they're not coming from a traditional background. Gotcha.

Unknown Speaker  14:53  
So switching gears to the actual benefit administration process, what are some of the most either common challenges for particularly difficult challenges that you encounter with administrative benefits?

Unknown Speaker  15:07  
Getting the initial application approved for new students. The VA website advertises a 30 day turnaround. A lot of students assume that's like 30 calendar days, when really it's closer to 30 business days, if that. And so if they're waiting, I wouldn't say to the last minute, but if they're not super proactive, and getting that applied, it can cause some stress for them if they don't have their certificate of eligibility on time and therefore can't get their benefits right away. Because actually, that's one of the benefits of doing the zero start process first, is because we do that ahead of the semester, it kick starts their housing allowance and book stipend. So they get back by the first day of term.

Unknown Speaker  15:50  
Kick starts the housing. Yeah, that makes sense. And sorry, if I sound like I'm talking to myself, I'm taking notes.

Unknown Speaker  15:58  
No, totally understand if it was anything I can clarify, please don't have.

Unknown Speaker  16:02  
No, that makes sense. So So kind of the the real, the real amount of time it takes to get the certificate of eligibility. Anything else that's a common or difficult challenges, or challenge rather,

Unknown Speaker  16:15  
um, I think because it's a military population, they move a lot. Just get because it's still physical mail. That can be a problem. You know, you guys may not have their most recent address on file. Or, you know, they're getting it sent to a p o box at their parents house or whatever. So I think if it were moved to like a digital certificate of eligibility, that would facilitate things a lot faster. And I use that as a general criticism for the VA being so reliant on physical mail.

Unknown Speaker  16:55  
Yeah, and that's, that's the kind of feedback that, you know, we're looking for, I mean, I'm on the team, responsible for thinking about digital process and product. So that's, this is the kind of insight that we would want to take to the Benefits Administration and say, help us understand why this is impossible. And how could we make it possible? Um, what are what are the some of the most common questions you get from folks, using this kind of benefits, anything that you you kind of have on speed dial in your brain? It's like, Oh, yeah, this is what you do.

Unknown Speaker  17:24  
Um, a lot of them want to know about the Yellow Ribbon Program. GW is a private institution. So we are pretty expensive. But we also have a very generous Yellow Ribbon Program. For example, GW has agreed to match an additional 24,000 and change for undergraduate students, meaning they have an additional $48,000 on top of their base benefit to us to attend school, we make those caps intentionally high so that students can afford to go to school year round if they need to. And so obviously, that's something that makes us attractive to potential students. And so they have a lot of questions of, am I, Paul? You know, what do I need to do to prove my eligibility? That kind of thing?

Unknown Speaker  18:12  
Um, do you hear any kind of concerns or complaints you mentioned the like, that 30 day, what 30 days actually is, with regards to administering benefits, any other kind of complaints or feedback, you hear from folks that are taking advantage of these benefits around the benefits themselves?

Unknown Speaker  18:32  
I get I do hear secondhand complaints about the contact center Be honest.

Unknown Speaker  18:39  
Sometimes?

Unknown Speaker  18:42  
Well, for example, until very recently,

Unknown Speaker  18:47  
the VA doesn't require that schools have a certificate of eligibility on file a certified student. But as a school, we'd have that policy because we want to make sure that we're submitting the right chapter of benefit. And for yellow ribbon eligible, we have their profile before selected as such, all of that. And those students might get upset being like, well, the VA doesn't require that you have the certificate of eligibility, why do you need one? And so sometimes the call center not like, in a malicious way or anything, sorry, I dropped the receiver there for a second. So we'll get information or sometimes the call center will say like, well, your school certified initially to do XYZ, not understanding like, the whole of the situation or whatever. And so sometimes, giving that puts me as a certifying official, an awkward position to be like, I know that the A told you this, but this is why I can do XYZ.

Unknown Speaker  19:42  
Yeah, so in this example, it's because in this case, you have a policy in place, ideally, to protect the students benefits. that's a that's a little more intense than at least until recently, what the VH policy was,

Unknown Speaker  20:01  
yeah, and another example is like for graduate students, we have to report what their full time modifier is. And that is something that the school tells the VA, so the VA call center will be like, well, your school tells us what's full time, they can tell us that you're full time. And I have to be, I have to turn around and be like, while we have to tell the VA what is full time if you're only in six credits, I can't pay your full time. Because you're not nine credits. Yeah. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  20:32  
Um, so this is kind of a different space or different kind of question. Are you familiar with websites where veterans or people who receive military benefits can provide feedback about your school? There's, there's a bunch of principles of excellence. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. How do you feel about those sites?

Unknown Speaker  20:56  
I think, in general, I think it's great. They provide a way to provide feedback, I do think it can be a little one sided. For example, if a student makes it principles of excellence complaint, we as a school don't have the opportunity to prove like robot or provide or demonstrate that there was a resolution came, it just stays is a complaint on the website. And right now, it stays as a complaint forever. There's no like, phase out system. So students can see that it was submitted to three, five years ago or whatever. But even if we were able to resolve the student issue, and a lot of times it's not their issues with the school in general, it's, and sometimes it's out of our hands, like it's a complaint about, you know, of course they want to register for or something that my office has no control over. But we're as a school, we're unable to say, well, we resolved to the students issue, or, you know, have it fall off the website after so long. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  22:00  
Thank you, any other sites besides principles of excellence that you come to mind when you think about that kind of site?

Unknown Speaker  22:07  
I'm not specifically where students provide feedback about the school. I don't think they can do that on the GI Bill comparison tool they can not so functionality I'm not aware of.

Unknown Speaker  22:21  
Gotcha. Hold on one second. My.

Unknown Speaker  22:25  
my mouse is frozen. I may have to just keep There we go. I'm gonna quit this and hope it restarts. Yeah, my, the where I was taking notes just crashed, which is one of the one of the benefits of working at the VA, we have the latest and greatest in computers from about 10 years ago.

Unknown Speaker  22:46  
Oh, no, I feel like you guys are the reason why I have a tower from 10 years ago. So I can still burn CDs.

Unknown Speaker  22:50  
There you go. Yeah, you could burn a CD of the latest hits from the radio. Let me tell you what we're recording call so I can continue. The only problem is I can't actually see what my next questions are. So I'd have to do that from memory. I'm going to see if I can become a computer hacker here and force things to There we go. Alright, we're back. So, um, no other sites besides the principles of excellence? Oh, are there any sites that you consider as good resource sites for information about your school Besides, of course, your.edu? Like, do you point people to any rating sites or any sites that lists information about your school that are outside of your, your own.edu? address?

Unknown Speaker  23:38  
I'm not usually know. Most of the time the questions they come to us are like school specific, like, how do I use my benefits here at GW and things like that? So or like, what scholarships can I apply for? So most of the time, it's GW internal issues that we assist with. We also do have a that success on campus counselor, Laura Ferrara, so we do sometimes refer students to her to help with more like, internal VA specific issues.

Unknown Speaker  24:10  
Gotcha. Um, and then, kind of related to that, like, there are a lot of portals out there, that, you know, create lists of schools that are good for various programs are various kinds of students. There are definitely a few that are like the best schools for veterans or military families.

Unknown Speaker  24:30  
We do participate in the best for events and the military time surveys for that,

Unknown Speaker  24:38  
and Military Times surveys,

Unknown Speaker  24:41  
and I get the names confused. So they may actually, that we participate in two of the big military surveys, their names are very similar. So I may not be getting them exactly right right now. But I do believe it is that I believe I do believe the two are the military types and best threats.

Unknown Speaker  24:58  
Okay, cool. Let's, uh, so if you have a zoom installed, and I see,

Unknown Speaker  25:07  
I see you’ve called in and I see your phone. Do you see a share button in the middle of the screen? Sure. Yeah. So click on share. And then choose the upper left corner, which should say screen or monitor and choose the there’s a button in the lower right that says share, or something like that? Let me know if Yep. Okay, I’m starting to see your screen. So what I’d like to do, is I just like to go through one or two scenarios that we described, in charge, telling me about how these benefits work. So let’s say that you heard that there was a new complaint on the principles of excellence site, how would you go and investigate that complaint. And while we’re doing this, since you’ve done usability testing before, just kind of speak out loud what you’re thinking and why you’re clicking on different things?

Unknown Speaker  25:59  
Sure. So usually, we get an email notification of the principles of excellence complaints, that’s kind of our first ping, we haven’t gotten one in a while, knock on wood. But normally, what we would do then, and I can’t really bring it up here, because it’s our student database, but we will look up the student in our R database were bad or evil, what that means anything to you. And look at their information and also taking the context of the complaint, like who we might need to reach out to is it reaching out to their academic advisor or their program manager? Is it reaching out to financial aid about an issue, just so we can make sure we have the fullest picture of what the students complaint is, and if necessary, reach out to the student for additional clarification. And then once we do have the full picture, kind of working as a liaison with the student and appropriate offices to come to a resolution, most of that conversation takes place via email. We welcome conference calls or in person meetings, I think,

Unknown Speaker  27:05  
let’s just say and that’s really, that process is really helpful. Um, let’s say that you wanted to look at like what complaints already existed in the system. You said earlier, like, there’s no way to retire or resolve complaints in that system. If we wanted to take a look and see what was there just to see if there were any patterns? Or maybe you were orienting a new staff member on your team, and you wanted to show them where this was? How would you get to them? Like how would you find those complaints? Specifically,

Unknown Speaker  27:33  
I would probably try to pull up the principles of excellence website. But it’s To be honest, it has been a while since I’ve been there.

Unknown Speaker  27:39  
That’s a good thing.

Unknown Speaker  27:51  
So

Unknown Speaker  27:55  
that first Google link does not

Unknown Speaker  27:59  
bring up the actual website. So maybe not all of it is on the GI Bill comparison tool. It might be.

Unknown Speaker  28:38  
So here are the student complaints, let me see if it’ll ever brings up.

Unknown Speaker  28:51  
It doesn’t look like we can access it from this. And so if we wanted like a list of all of them, I’m not entirely sure where I would go to be honest, public archive.

Unknown Speaker  29:04  
And that’s fine. Like that’s, this is the kind of process we wanted to observe, like, what you might click on and why. And it looks like all of these links go to kind of the general information about complaints, but not necessarily the complaints themselves. Right. So what I’d like you to do is on this page, scroll up, scroll up to kind of the top of the page. And just take take a look at this page and tell me what you think the students that you are supporting, what are the things that they are the most interested in or ask you about the most?

Unknown Speaker  29:39  
Like I said, definitely yellow Roman. And we do have the three different caps based on their degree level. Most of our students are graduate, that’s in trend with the whole school is,

Unknown Speaker  29:53  
in general, we’re about two thirds graduate.

Unknown Speaker  30:01  
We don’t have a cap on the number of students who can participate. So a lot of the questions we do get our financial base, because they want to make sure that they can afford GW before they come, which I totally understand and happy to sit through and, you know, talk through your academic plan for the next two years to figure out if you can do this,

Unknown Speaker  30:19  
that does that. Because it’s usually a graduate degree, or is it a transfer? Or is it just you think into your terms,

Unknown Speaker  30:27  
which we usually use two years, it’s just kind of like a base window, because after that, it can get a little bit too loose and unpredictable. Especially when we’re trying to help a student like, calculate entitlement time, how much entitlement will they be using? How much will they have left a fatty? When will they run out? So those kinds of questions. Like we have to preface everything by saying this is an estimate. But usually, we we try to work two years in advance as a general rule, like that’s where that’s also our timeline, where we ask students to send us a new certificate of eligibility if the one we have on file is two years older, more, just so we can make sure that we have semi recent information to help advise them with.

Unknown Speaker  31:19  
So Yellow Ribbon was one thing you said on this page that they would they would be looking at. And

Unknown Speaker  31:25  
the allowance, that’s another big one.

Unknown Speaker  31:29  
Especially for undergraduates? Well, I for both population were both grads and undergrads. But for different reasons. undergrads want to know if the housing is going to cover the room and board fees that aren’t, you know, explicitly paid for by the GI Bill. and graduate students, especially those with families want to know what their housing allowance is, so they can budget for like rent and things? Got it?

Unknown Speaker  31:58  
Okay, anything else that jumps out in terms of things that students would be like, Oh, this is important to me, or this helps me move forward in the process?

Unknown Speaker  32:11  
I’m not from a student perspective. I think those are the those are the questions we get the most. Yeah. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  32:21  
All right, great. Well, listen, I was shooting for 40 minutes, I think we’re awfully close. So I feel proud of the fact that we kept on time. Do you have any other questions for me about what we’ve looked at today? Or what we’ve discussed or why we’re doing this research? I’m happy to answer any questions you might have.

Unknown Speaker  32:38  
Sure. So can you just give me a little bit of a bigger picture of like, you know, how many schools are talking to what kind of schools you’re talking to and what your guys’s like ultimate goals are?

Unknown Speaker  32:47  
Yeah, absolutely. So the schools that we’re talking to are specifically schools that were named in a research study that we did. So we spent part of June and July, talking to veterans and active duty, folks that are taking advantage of GI Bill benefits. And we recruited just randomly a set of people to talk to them about how did they learn about their benefits, and what their experience was in terms of applying for their benefits and using their benefits. We then to follow up, we wanted to talk with schools certifying officials, for specifically for the schools that were named in the study. So there are some we must have talked to a student that attended GW at some point. And we wanted to see, you know, if there were one of the things we’re looking for is if there are patterns between SEOs and students that we can help, you know, make easier or improve. So when I was actually asking you questions about things that are unique to your process, or questions about like, what are common questions, and you talked about that, like did the potential of a digital certificate of eligibility, that’s the kind of thing that we’re looking at, as, okay, if we hear that that is going to make a big difference from enough students and from schools. The question then becomes, okay, what is the what are the barriers to making that happen? And just assessing digitally? How might we do that? One of the things that we’re looking at right now, the VA is setting up what’s called an API service, tell me if you have no idea what that is, or if you already, I do not know what that is. So an API service, it stands for application program interface, which means, let’s say that you had software like you’re you said, you were a banner school, I know what that means, because I have a background in higher ed. So I know better school, PeopleSoft school, etc. So you’re a banner school. And let’s say you have a banner application on your on your end, that allows you to lookup student records to see that their CEO is up to date, etc. What we could build, and we’ve done this for health care of certain healthcare applications, and we’re doing this for other things. We’ve built what’s called an API layer, which would allow your application to check our system. So instead of a piece of paper, like you were describing, we might be able to create a system that you could log into, and actually get the certificate of eligibility yourself or the veteran could get it themselves digitally, and then send you a code, which then, you know, yeah, yeah. So there’s, there’s a lot of ways that could play out. But that’s one of the spaces that we’re exploring is like, you know, if we look at the big picture, not just specific chapters, or specific, like, we’re not just looking at the comparison tool, what are the one of the priority parts of the user experience that we can improve? and Co Op? pain point seems to be an obvious one, that I think, you know, I’m going to be writing up some recommendations, and quoting you anonymously, and saying, you know, if we had a digital COE, that would really make a big difference, and talking about the reality of 30, business days plus. So those are the kind of things that we’re looking at. And then ultimately, looking at trying to make all of these tools work a little better for veterans. So this tool, like you scroll up and down this page, and you were like yellow ribbon, housing, and out of pocket costs, those are like the three things that you mentioned. And those are pretty common. So we want to make sure that these digital tools that we’re working with the Edu service to build, that we’re building the tools that they don’t become kind of unwieldy, when they have to do too many things for too many people.

Unknown Speaker  36:56  
You know, kind of make sure they do the right thing. The other thing that I think was really interesting from our conversation was that principles of excellence issue, like, with other CEOs that I’ve talked to, they’ve talked about, well, if we could actually respond to the complaints, so there was a track record of showing the dialogue and the resolution, that would be a whole different thing versus what it is now, which is it’s kind of a, an everlasting demerit system, which is like, you hope to not accumulate these demerits. But if you do, you can never kind of get rid of them. And I think that’s kind of that’s kind of a non contextual way of thinking about this. You know, like, if you think about it in context, it might have been resolved, or it might have been something that was unresolvable, or it might have been a mistake. So those are some of the things that we’re trying to do, of course, within the law, but those are things I exploring is kind of making the experience better. Does that answer your question?

Unknown Speaker  37:53  
Now that that provides a lot of context, I appreciate it, just help me understand.

Unknown Speaker  37:59  
Yeah. And I appreciate you like doing this without that context, because I didn’t want that context to influence your answers. Now, given that context, is there anything else you would add?

Unknown Speaker  38:11  
I’m

Unknown Speaker  38:17  
trying to think just like, kind of one thing that popped in my head is kind of like overlap as you leave the digital theory thing. One thing that I know VA has been working on as part of the coma react, is allowing schools to see what a student’s entitlement is. And VA one. They haven’t quite worked that out yet. Right. Now we can see students who are in chapter 30, or 1606, what their entitlement is, but no other chapter. And they’re part of the difficulty is they have to create an opt out system where students can choose not to share that with the school. So it sounds like, you know, you guys are trying to accomplish the same things make it easier for us schools to see a student’s entitlement, just from different angles. Like I said, so far, that hasn’t really been implemented, while NBA ones and one of the things that isn’t currently on their docket for that portion that I would like to see personally is active duty status. Because until 2022, active duty students, for their spouses are not eligible for yellow ribbon. So if I see there, 100%, that’s, that only answers half of the question for me. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  39:34  
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  39:38  
That’s really helpful. That kind of like specific gray or not gray area, but kind of a gap between what the law is, and information that would help you do your job better. That’s the kind of that’s really helpful this. So just so I got that correctly, you know, your ability to see active duty status would help you answer Yellow Ribbon inquiries more accurately, because if they are active duty, they wouldn’t be eligible until 2020.

Unknown Speaker  40:07  
Right. And like, that’s sometimes that’s an issue where like students, when they started at GW may have been active duty, but they’ve gotten off active duty since. So I need a new certificate of eligibility from them, showing that they’re no longer on active duty. And so again, you know, getting a new Co Op, they are mailed one every time we certify them. But again, the physical mail issue with a move or you know, they didn’t keep that one letter or whatever. And they request a new one and just delays the whole process of getting them the yellow ribbon funds they may need.

Unknown Speaker  40:42  
That is that is bad that that’s happening. But it’s really helpful that you’re describing the sequence of events that leads to it.

Unknown Speaker  40:52  
benefits that they need. Well, thank you. Anything else that comes to mind before we go about our days?

Unknown Speaker  41:00  
I think that answers all my questions. And hopefully, I was able to provide some helpful feedback for you guys as well.

Unknown Speaker  41:06  
Yeah, very helpful, very helpful. And I we really appreciate your time. This is like, obviously, it’s a it’s a complex set of variables that we’re trying to get connected in a way that makes things easier for both veterans and the people supporting them. So your time today is a big part of helping us make those connections. Thank you very much.

Unknown Speaker  41:25  
No problem. Let me know if there’s any follow up or clarification that you need later on.

Unknown Speaker  41:30  
I will thanks, have a great afternoon. You too. Bye bye.

## UMBC (2 of 2)
Unknown Speaker  0:03  
So what I want to talk to you about is

Unknown Speaker  0:07  
kind of learning about the process from when you first come in contact with a veteran or an active duty service member, all the way through to when they might start their education. And I realized that's a big process. And it's going to be different for for everyone, like, there's a lot of variations in that process. But what we want to do is we want to get a sense of what what are the common pieces that everyone has to deal with are some of the more like, some of the things that come up for more often, for folks.

Unknown Speaker  0:37  
Um, and

Unknown Speaker  0:39  
a lot of this is going to be based on your memory of, you know, sessions and specific students that you felt. But some of it might be based on things you haven't done before. Like, we might look at a website. And we, you might have to kind of think, oh, what I might do with this would be that, yes, yeah. So we'll talk for about 15 minutes, and then we'll switch over to the web, but I'm going to ask you to show me some of the things that you might have done or how you might have helped students in the past or things you might have set them set them. So tell me, how long have you been working at the institution that you're at in this role?

Unknown Speaker  1:13  
I'm actually for a very short time I started June 10.

Unknown Speaker  1:17  
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:18  
Prior to this, I worked at UMUC, a different institution for six years. Okay. As a certification specialist, so I was very familiar, still working with these websites. And I was on the frontline staff, basically, supporting the CEOs at that time. With certifications prepare, helping with preparing certifications, not submitting, but also answering all phone calls for just VA benefits for the stateside Europe and Asia. Freedom You see, so a lot of experience with that.

Unknown Speaker  1:57  
Okay, awesome.

Unknown Speaker  2:00  
So when you were at, actually, since you've only been there since June, let's focus on UMUC. Yes, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  2:09  
Well, you see, I gotcha. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  2:12  
Yeah. So when you were at UMUC, for six years, roughly, about how many veterans or service members did you and your team work with each semester? Like how many?

Unknown Speaker  2:22  
Yeah, it was quite a bit. Um, I'm not sure if you're familiar with it. But I mean, UMUC, basic, Lee, they recently changed their name to UMGC. But the school is primarily an online school. They offer though hybrid courses with about 90,000 students, for enrollment wise. And the school is geared more towards veteran students. That's how it started. So VA benefits, very big deal there. We basically had our own department, just for VA, for VA benefits with about, I would say, maybe 10. certifying officials there. So it was a it was a very big process. So we had to just we, so for certification wise, I guess it's hard to give you a number off the cuff. But definitely, you know, on a yearly basis, we would deal deal with thousands.

Unknown Speaker  3:24  
Yeah, okay. Thousands of that service.

Unknown Speaker  3:30  
I'm taking notes while you talk. So I might sound like I'm talking to myself or be on a little bit. Yeah. So talk me through the process of at a high level of helping a veteran plan their education. And it lets, I think it might be better to stick with UMUC. Because I'm imagining there's some differences, and you haven't spent as much time working at you MBC. Or it could be a hybrid of both. But like, what is like if there was a book about this process? What would the chapter headings be?

Unknown Speaker  4:03  
Yeah, great question.

Unknown Speaker  4:07  
So I think it's, it's easier for me to talk about a little bit about both, because I think that I'm kind of getting the hang of what we do over here for students, you MBC because this is a more, this is a traditional school. So a lot of students there, they're younger, the demographic is younger, they're mostly dependence using their parents VA benefits, but also parents want to know about it as well there, you know, they want they come to me and ask questions. And I noticed that they like to come in in person, and just meet with somebody face to get that face to face interaction, that seems to be very important to them. Over at UMUC, I didn't have that, honestly, I think that their expectations were, you know, manage their because they realize that they're going to an online school. The main thing I do want to bring up is that I always found myself, um, this is just something that I kind of got in the habit to do is to tell students that, Hey, have you applied for VA benefits through the VA first, because most of the time, especially here at you MBC, traditional young students, they don't know that they need to go through the process of going to the VS website, first applying for benefits, you know, completing that form. So I'm always I like to use that is a resource. And that's a good start, obviously, I think that's like, you know, the best starting point, step one, you know, have you apply for VA benefits, please go to the VS website. And I've been trying to go to the website, often, because I know that I believe that you guys have just redone the website. So I like to just kind of familiarize myself with it. Keep myself up to date with any changes, obviously, that you guys make, so that I can walk students through the process accurately. Give them the best information.

Unknown Speaker  6:15  
We'll get to

Unknown Speaker  6:17  
Yeah, I'm going to ask you some more questions about how you keep yourself up to date in a minute. So a student, one of the first thing that you do is is ask them if they've applied for VA benefits through the VA site?

Unknown Speaker  6:31  
Yes.

Unknown Speaker  6:32  
Let's say they go and do that. Or you you kind of show them where to do that. And they do that. What's the next thing that happens in the process that you help them? Along with?

Unknown Speaker  6:44  
Have you obtained your CFP certificate of eligibility? You know, I asked them, Are they aware of this? So a lot of times, they don't know what that is. So I find myself kind of describing this documents to them and how to get it, where to find it.

Unknown Speaker  7:05  
And then once they get they bring that to you, where they submit that.

Unknown Speaker  7:09  
I so basically, we have a veterans email account here set up, and they're supposed to send it to that email, but their staff is transitioning. So they haven't set up, send directly to me basically, they, they refer the those documents and and I'm more than happy. I basically tell students, whenever I come in contact with students, I say, hey, look, please just send it directly to my email. So I have them send it to. Yeah, directly my email.

Unknown Speaker  7:41  
Okay. So what are some of the most common or difficult challenges that you encounter during the benefit application process? So like, the one thing I want to distinguish between is like, there's kind of two separate application processes. There's, there's the VA, if an application process is the actual school application, exactly.

Unknown Speaker  8:03  
Let's talk about the VA benefit application process first, like reminding younger students, it sounds like you have to actually apply First, it sounds like a common a common challenge. What are there any other common challenges?

Unknown Speaker  8:17  
Um, no, you're right. I mean, you hit the nail on the head. And I think the the main hiccup that they get with the VA application at this is just from what I'm told, and I've tried to actually go to the I mean, I've done this as well, obviously, I can only do it to a certain point, because I can't fill out the application for myself, right, the student do it. But I try to, you know, go through the steps with them sometimes if I have the time, um, you know, and they get stuck. And one of the things is, some parents are worried about like, Is there a place for us to put, you know, the direct deposit information for the VA to send, you know, the book allowance, money, housing allowance, money to, can I put my own information there so that my child doesn't get it. And, you know, I can manage the money for the student. So these are the questions that I get, some students get a little bit lost, because they want to make sure that they're filing the application as a dependent. And, to my knowledge, this form basically dynamically changed, depending on how they answer the questions that you that you guys have posed to them. Which is great, I think.

Unknown Speaker  9:34  
Yeah. Okay. Uh, so what about the school application process for specifically veterans or beneficiaries? Is there anything in the school application process that you have found, like are common? Either speed bumps or? Or things? Are there more difficult for this audience?

Unknown Speaker  9:54  
So that's a great question. I'm happy you asked that I as you know, like I said, I recently started this position in June, June 10. specific way, and I'm in the VA application here is a paper will, it is uploaded onto the registrar's website online for students to access. But it's basically a DocuSign, you know, two page document first, first page, as all the necessary information for our for us, like SES is to process second pages for students to sign. A lot of students kind of missed the fact that they need to sign at the very bottom on the second page. So I always double check that and just make sure that they've signed acknowledged all of these policies and rules. And then I've actually recently last Friday, spent some time redoing the application, because I just wanted to include more information on there to help me process the claim for you guys. So one of the things that I did was I actually removed their was a chapter 34 benefit on there. And obviously, Chapter 34 no longer exists, it's been merged into other benefits. So I've consolidated the form made fields for you know, students to provide their email address on their reason for adjust, you know, important things like that, it to indicate whether they're online or face to face, important to me, just to help basically help me process and help the student you know, so that they can be better served, they can get their claim out faster.

Unknown Speaker  11:35  
Um, so I want to make sure I understand this correctly. This is a huge MBC form. This isn't Yeah, this

Unknown Speaker  11:41  
is the school side, this is a school form.

Unknown Speaker  11:46  
And it's kind of like you getting the information you need to process anything.

Unknown Speaker  11:50  
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, this isn't a VA Form or anything like that. This is the school form, when we get this is called a semester certification request. And we and this is our process so that we are aware that the students using VA benefits. Prior to this at UMUC. The application was online. So it was kind of like embedded into PeopleSoft system. Uh huh. And then the students would just basically go through the answers and, you know, fill out everything and then hit submit, and then we get filtered out through into into PeopleSoft. My goal is to eventually get us towards that. In spring 2020, so

Unknown Speaker  12:37  
cool. I was gonna assume I would have assumed that was preferable, but I didn't. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  12:45  
Back to that

Unknown Speaker  12:46  
in spring 2020. Um, one of the most common questions you get from veterans and servicemembers applying to you MBC or UMUC, for that matter, and, and we can, if it makes sense to break it into two conversations or two answers, we can because I would imagine the questions would be somewhat different. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  13:07  
Yeah. So the most common question, while definitely I can tell you it UMUC was, it was about housing allowance, right? So you know, I'm sure you got this a lot. It was how does the VA see me as full time? You know, and and that was a big deal. So, you know, as naturally I discussed about Raider pursued things of that nature, let them know, you know,

Unknown Speaker  13:36  
how you guys consider them as full time? And then

Unknown Speaker  13:41  
another question was, how do I get started with VA benefits? You know, obviously, they, they, I guess they have no prior knowledge or no clue on how to get started, how to use VA benefits, what do I need to do? What documents Do I need to send then? To the school? And unfortunately, they don't seem to be aware that they need to do anything with the VA. So I try to gently you know, tell them that, hey, just make sure that you do this, this VA forum, things like that.

Unknown Speaker  14:17  
And when you say they don't need to be aware, are you referring specifically more to UU MBC students who are usually children of benefit of veterans? Or? Like, is this veterans and active duty service members as well?

Unknown Speaker  14:35  
What's the awareness of? Whoa, what was that?

Unknown Speaker  14:39  
How do I get started with the benefits? Is that is that all all of the people use a border? Is that something that that was a jet? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  14:47  
that was for everybody. That was the main question for encompassed everybody is how do I get started? Gotcha.

Unknown Speaker  14:54  
Okay. What do you Where do you send them when you when you want to help them? Like? Do you? Are there particular websites or resources you use to help them get started a

Unknown Speaker  15:02  
website, definitely love your guys's website, and send them there. So they can get their information and fill out the application there. And also know what they what they also asked for da This was at UMUC. Because students were relying on housing allowance more at UMUC.

Unknown Speaker  15:28  
They were more adults.

Unknown Speaker  15:31  
And so they would ask,

Unknown Speaker  15:37  
oh, should I just forgot housing allowance?

Unknown Speaker  15:44  
When you said like, how does the VA see me as full time and you discuss the rate? And how they work? How they would pass the threshold of full time? Was there anything else about the housing allowance? They would ask it UMUC?

Unknown Speaker  15:56  
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  15:57  
I'm

Unknown Speaker  16:00  
how to maximize it.

Unknown Speaker  16:04  
Oh, they would Oh, this was what it was. They asked for dollar amounts, they wanted specific dollar amounts. And obviously, we I never gave them exact dollar amounts, we were not allowed to disclose that information to students. And so what I would do in those cases is I would just refer them to you guys to the VA for specific dollar amounts. And I would say to students that this this kind of thing is obviously it's paid out directly from the VA to you guys. They're the best, you know, people to be able to give you the exact dollar amount, because when it comes to that housing allowance and that dollar amount, I know that there are specific calculations that the VA runs with that. And there's no way like I said, anyways, that we're about to guess or give any kind of limit for it. misinformation about that. So that was the policy at UMUC was just do not give students any kind of dollar amount or anything like that. And I basically continue that.

Unknown Speaker  17:07  
Yep. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  17:12  
Do you hear any specific concerns or complaints from folks related to how they get benefits from the VA? Like, what kind of problems? Have you heard about? Um, or question? You know, like, yeah, I wish this was different.

Unknown Speaker  17:28  
Yeah, great, great question. Um,

Unknown Speaker  17:31  
namely, they, when they get try to get in contact with the VA, I know that some students get a little bit of frustrated with the wait time, things like that, they told me to contact the VA.

Unknown Speaker  17:46  
So I'd get some of that here in there.

Unknown Speaker  17:50  
Also, maybe a little bit of like, delay, all of pavements.

Unknown Speaker  17:55  
Natural, naturally, what I what I'm telling students now, and what I've always told you to it, is I say, look, the sooner your request benefits, and I say, as soon as registration opens, you know, get in the classes that you want to be in, and then please, you know, send your request to me as soon as possible. So as soon as you enroll in classes, complete our application, our school application, and also the VA is application, if you need to still, and then you know, I can get you certified right away. So there's no delay in your payments, especially if you're, you know, relying on housing allowance or book allowance money. So that's what I that's the steps that I've taken to try and mitigate that from a school and, you know, meet the certifying official and cool.

Unknown Speaker  18:46  
Um, how do you feel about online feedback that veterans might post about your school? So like, there are websites, nice, calm. There's other ones, where veterans can post? Like, this is how we feel about going to this school? How do you feel about that? Do you pay attention to stuff like that,

Unknown Speaker  19:09  
um, obviously, I didn't know who was out there. I didn't know it existed. I'm not surprised. Um, I think that that's great, honestly, that, you know, students can go out there communicate to each other about, you know, and share their feedback. I think, obviously, like I'm doing now for you, I think feedback is always very important for everybody. So we can just make things better. So I'm always open to that. And you know, if there's anything that we need to do on the school's on to improve anything, which, you know, I'm sure there always is, you know, we need to know about that we need to be aware, I would like to I would like to know, from students directly, if they can give me any feedback. And a lot of times, I feel like students have always shared with me their feet back very openly. Um, from my conversations with them. If they had any concerns or complaints, they would share it with me, and then I would do my best to just address that however I which I can.

Unknown Speaker  20:16  
Cool.

Unknown Speaker  20:17  
But those aren't sites that you're generally familiar with, or they're not.

Unknown Speaker  20:22  
And I just don't have the time to be honest with you to go, you know, to do that.

Unknown Speaker  20:27  
Yeah. What sites do you consider to be authoritative information on your schools? This is, you

Unknown Speaker  20:37  
know, like VA benefits specifically?

Unknown Speaker  20:40  
Well, not not not, not specific to benefits. But like, if, let's say you were talking to a student, a prospective student, who is a veteran, and they were trying to decide between, you know, you MBC and a different school?

Unknown Speaker  20:57  
What kind of information would you give them? To the to help them make the decision? Are there any websites that you consider as like, this is the best way to learn about the rights at the school? Why wouldn't give any third party website, obviously, I would always say, hey, look, please just go to the.edu website of our school, and please go to the.edu website of their school. And just please look at the information, compare, and whoever you like, whoever, whoever is more suitable for whatever you're pursuing? You know, go off of that.

Unknown Speaker  21:37  
Okay, so there's no websites that you use, like, US News and World Report? No. Got it?

Unknown Speaker  21:49  
Um, do you? Do you go to those kind of websites

Unknown Speaker  21:53  
to?

Unknown Speaker  21:57  
Like, verify information is correct. And I realized it might not be you personally. But are you aware of anyone who goes to those kind of school listing websites? Or portal websites?

Unknown Speaker  22:07  
No, not that Not that I'm aware of? No. And I don't personally I don't do that. Yeah. I always try to I rely on for sure. I rely on va news VA website, you know, from you guys. Specifically, I look out for emails notifications from you guys, specifically. Because as a school certifying official, and you know, having gone through the VA training, like this is exactly what you know, what we need to stick to. So I don't deviate.

Unknown Speaker  22:39  
Got it? So, um, there were two websites we talked about, really, in our conversation. One was the NBC website specifically. And the form that they have to fill out on the NBC site that's currently a form they would need to print and do via paper. And we talked to using the VA website as well. So if what I'd like to do is if you could share your screen. And let me know if you need help with that. If you're familiar with, can you? Do I need to go to Team viewer or so in zoom? There should be in the middle of the screen, like a share button with a couple of screens on it? Oh, got it. Yeah, and then just select the upper left corner, and then the lower right corner. So the upper left corner should be like monitor screen green. Yeah. And then the lower right corner should be a blue button or a green button. what color it is, there it is. Okay, super. So what I'd like you to do, is, I would like you to imagine that I'm a veteran. And we're sitting together, and you're showing me how to get to the you MBC forum for that I have to fill out for the school. Show me how I do that. And while you're doing that, if you just kind of think out loud, like, imagine you're coaching me and what would you be saying to me like, I get to this website? What do I do first?

Unknown Speaker  24:12  
Yeah, so I would go. So thank you for asking that. I would go to registrar dot you mbc.edu.

Unknown Speaker  24:19  
Okay, is that that's not the homepage, right?

Unknown Speaker  24:22  
No, this is not the homepage. This brings the students specifically to our registrar website.

Unknown Speaker  24:28  
And then if I had to find this again, what would I do?

Unknown Speaker  24:31  
registrar? dot you mbc.edu?

Unknown Speaker  24:34  
You tell you would distribute distribute the URL? Okay. Exactly.

Unknown Speaker  24:38  
Yeah. And then across the very top, I say forms. And very bottom last option, veteran benefits forms. And I recently got this change to veteran benefits before this, it said Veteran Affairs forms. I just like veteran benefits better coming home, you see, because UMUC a lot of the questions that I got or, like, you know that there's their student affairs, that we also had you MBC was so big with their veteran population, they had some, like Veteran Affairs, kind of things. You MBC also offers that here with off campus student services for Vets like events and things of that nature. I just didn't want students to be confused. So I made sure to get this changed here. And this was, I think, literally updated yesterday, Monday to benefits forum. So I say last option, veteran benefits forms. And you can see there at the very top, this is our information, quick link on the side. And I say just click on Download form. So here we have the processing time procedure, purpose, add, drop. And then they click on the form here.

Unknown Speaker  26:03  
And this takes them to our certification form. So like I said, pages, second page, lines, first page, the student fills out.

Unknown Speaker  26:14  
So I want to just take a second and look at this. So um, so this is, do I do this once per semester?

Unknown Speaker  26:26  
Yes. I'm happy that you asked that. So one of the common, I always say this to students, I've said it at UBC. And I just basically continue to say this here. It's one of my best practices thing. So when I speak with students, and I'm sorry, if I didn't mention this earlier, when students asked me, you know, you know, how do I What do I need to do? One of the things I say, as I walk them through to this form, like I'm doing with you now, as I say, please remember, you need to complete this form every semester. And so I say it like this, I say, so spring, summer fall, just make sure that you're in the classes that you need to be in step one step to complete this form. And that way, there's no confusion, students know that they need to complete this every form, I make sure that I get the information that I need from students, and I can get them submitted.

Unknown Speaker  27:24  
Right, now, let me let's scroll down the form a little bit, because I just want to take a look. So this is all pretty straightforward. Now branch military status. So I want to ask you a kind of a hypothetical question. This is so that you can certify the benefit status of this particular student? Correct?

Unknown Speaker  27:46  
Correct.

Unknown Speaker  27:47  
Um,

Unknown Speaker  27:51  
what happens with this form after it comes to you? Like what, what's the workflow for this form?

Unknown Speaker  27:57  
Yes. So after I receive it, um, obviously, I transpose the information on to a database where we, where we have a records, and we keep the students information for this. And then I can either a scan it myself, and we have a drive called the box, where we organize all students files. And it's very easy to find easy, easily accessible, and I can I just put it, I draw a drop it into the students file, we also have Student Help here that basically scan documents, and so I can just, you know, get it and get drop it into our area that needs to be you know, where they scan it, and then it gets sent to the same basically same area, the students file and box.

Unknown Speaker  28:59  
Yeah. Okay. So the form is scanned, when you say you transpose it into a database. Is that like, the administrative system, the equivalent of PeopleSoft? Or is it somewhere else?

Unknown Speaker  29:10  
Yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  29:12  
Alright, so that's the like, student admitted, administrative record system? And then, once it's scanned in and it's transposed into that database, are you done? Like, is there anything else you have to do? Do you have to go somewhere and say, the form was entered? Or? Or, you know, is there anything, you have to go back to the registrar and say,

Unknown Speaker  29:33  
this, like,

Unknown Speaker  29:34  
know me, I know, likely I start, I start certifying, but um, I know that like it, like, for example, like, if students email the form directly to me, I just make sure to, you know, send them a message back, say this is received, obviously, I send a lot of communications to students as a certifying official, for more clarity or more information, sometimes, you know, as you as maybe VA knows, students don't fill out the form completely, you know, or they leave a lot information out, or they, you know, they check something that confuses us. So, we, you know, we, you know, so for those instances, I just the only other thing that I do basically is just reach out to students with more communication, as much as I can to be transparent. Let them know, Hey, this is what I'm doing. This has been submitted things of that nature.

Unknown Speaker  30:26  
Okay, super. So let's go to va.gov.

Unknown Speaker  30:35  
And let's say,

Unknown Speaker  30:43  
let's say that you wanted to help a student start to get like, they've asked for that housing allowance question. And you're like, we can't give you a specific dollar amount. But here's how you would find, here's how you would find out what your allowance is for you. MBC? How would you help them find that information here? what we what we tell them to do?

Unknown Speaker  31:03  
So I Excuse me? That's okay. So I know, when I was at UMUC, thank you, um, I? Well, the first thing I do obviously apply for education benefits, you know, if they're applying for benefits, and regards to housing allowance for that dollar amount, I know that the VA had a, and I believe you I still do is a calculator to calculate out the housing allowance costs, and they can get in. But see, when I was at EMC, I was told that it's not entirely accurate. Um, that was one of the things. So, um, you see, what we did was yes, we shared that information with them on the VS. website. But we also just gave them the number to VA number, the four of four or five number for the for the students to call the VA and just speak with speak with somebody there to get the the exact dollar amount, you know, and get the best information. Because housing allowance, always a serious topic and just the calculator. Yeah, that's awesome. But I feel like it just didn't give the students the satisfaction that they needed. Um, in terms of, you know, what answers they were looking for? I feel like students really they wanted somebody to talk to about that.

Unknown Speaker  32:35  
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  32:36  
Got it. Okay. Um, so let's assume that. And we're just going to imagine this scenario here that a student has said, I've called the VA, is there anything you can show me on the website? Are you aware of anything that would help me kind of give me a range of what the housing minute benefit might be?

Unknown Speaker  32:57  
Yeah, CI, and I am not aware. I know that I'm sure that there's information on here for housing allowance. I just don't actually know. I don't know where this is. on here.

Unknown Speaker  33:12  
On what would what would your best guests be like looking at the options you have? Is there something you might Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  33:17  
let's take a look.

Unknown Speaker  33:45  
I'm just looking at the VS. website. Right. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  33:46  
take your time.

Unknown Speaker  33:58  
And of course, this is a been like recently changed, so I know. Yeah, no worries. We're familiar in school enrollment.

Unknown Speaker  34:12  
Okay, yeah, I'm aware of this the GI Bill comparison tool. That is also great tool for students to compare schools for VA benefits.

Unknown Speaker  34:29  
Let's see.

Unknown Speaker  34:36  
So I would think,

Unknown Speaker  34:40  
yeah, and there was the GI School feedback tool where students can give feedback on the school here. So that was another area on the website. These are things that I remember long ago at you, when you see that we were that we could give to students. Yeah, I'll be honest with you. I mean, we we didn't find ourselves having to utilize a lot of this. Students just didn't ask these questions. They didn't ask like, Hey, can you help me figure out what my housing benefit? What? No, they didn't ask like, Hey, can I compare your school versus another school? And you and gotcha in you? Can you direct me to somewhere on you know, to compare that the for VA benefit wise? Right, what schools better? I think students did that research on their own. They didn't this, you know, necessarily volunteer that information over to me, so I couldn't direct them to like this tool here on the VS. website, although I think that's great for students. Um, the rates? So basically, right here, I would say rate tables.

Unknown Speaker  36:11  
Yeah, I'm sorry, I just can't find the the rate for housing allowance, I believe. The best thing, what I would do is I always just kind of referred them to the VA, and I never received any kind of, you know, complaints or anything from students afterwards. So whatever that

Unknown Speaker  36:32  
is.

Unknown Speaker  36:37  
What did you just do?

Unknown Speaker  36:39  
Go back one step and show me what you clicked on. I missed that. I am a veteran.

Unknown Speaker  36:43  
So I went to the drop down here, golf, you guys kind of selected this. And I'm hoping like anything, this can give me probably the best like, route. about housing allowance.

Unknown Speaker  37:00  
Yeah. So I'm going to take you to a specific page.

Unknown Speaker  37:03  
Go back two steps. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  37:14  
What I'd like you to do

Unknown Speaker  37:18  
is go back one more step.

Unknown Speaker  37:22  
And then I'd like you to click on the GI Bill comparison tool. Okay. And what I'd like you to do is, see if you can find the housing benefits specifically for students attending you, MBC. And just for the heck of it, let's, let's make sure we're looking at this from the perspective of a beneficiary of a veteran, not a veteran. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  37:55  
We can assume all of those.

Unknown Speaker  37:56  
Yeah, all of that. Right.

Unknown Speaker  38:16  
Okay, so it looks like the schools not popping up. Let's see University.

Unknown Speaker  38:26  
Or if I just type in the acronym.

Unknown Speaker  38:30  
Oh, here we go.

Unknown Speaker  38:34  
Okay, so here's the monthly dollar amount here.

Unknown Speaker  38:40  
For How is it? Is this your campus?

Unknown Speaker  38:44  
Um,

Unknown Speaker  38:47  
Columbia, Maryland? No.

Unknown Speaker  38:53  
Let's see view details.

Unknown Speaker  39:03  
We're definitely not a private school. So this probably isn't the

Unknown Speaker  39:12  
way isn't the school.

Unknown Speaker  39:18  
So um, yeah. Type? University of Maryland. Yeah. And then see if there's a result that suggested

Unknown Speaker  39:29  
Well, there's here I'm you see where I worked at on Global Campus, they changed their name to UM, GC.

Unknown Speaker  39:38  
And then University of Maryland.

Unknown Speaker  39:42  
No, so our schools not on this list.

Unknown Speaker  39:45  
I'm try you. MBC.

Unknown Speaker  39:49  
And you MBC. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  39:52  
And then select that first option and see if it goes to the training centers again. I think did it refresh? Yeah. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  40:03  
Do me a favor and type University of Baltimore comma.

Unknown Speaker  40:10  
And this is me. I'm trying to observe. Yeah, the tool behaves okay. Yeah, so that's right. Type University of Maryland. Oh, I'm sorry. Type University of Maryland, comma. That's what I meant. I said, Okay. All right, right. Yeah, that's not suggesting anything. So type University of Maryland. And get rid of that comment and just run the search. And let's see if your school shows up in the results.

Unknown Speaker  40:39  
Okay. I'm just gonna hit enter.

Unknown Speaker  40:41  
Yeah, that's fine.

Unknown Speaker  40:43  
Oh, here it is. Right.

Unknown Speaker  40:45  
So it's University of Maryland. Baltimore County. Oh, my God. All right. Okay. So yeah,

Unknown Speaker  40:50  
and that's specifically dad. After that.

Unknown Speaker  40:53  
Yeah, this is a this is a known issue. Um, but it's, but it's something that I wanted to see for years. Basically what it was doing, I'm glad.

Unknown Speaker  41:03  
Yeah. So go ahead and click on that page. And just tell me about how you react to what you see.

Unknown Speaker  41:10  
Yeah, this makes sense. Because this is our population right here about 400. Roughly.

Unknown Speaker  41:17  
GI Bill.

Unknown Speaker  41:20  
So this is definitely, this is definitely our page here. I feel comfortable with this information.

Unknown Speaker  41:27  
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  41:32  
So here, again, this is an estimate. It's not, you know, to the tea, per se, but yeah, housing allowance here book stipend, tuition and fees.

Unknown Speaker  42:07  
And for yellow ribbon, there's only as you can see, one recipient, their yellow ribbon is not very common. At you MBC. edu MUC. It was you know, we had a lot of students

Unknown Speaker  42:21  
naturally. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  42:27  
So overall, is there anything here that you feel like, is either particularly helpful? Or?

Unknown Speaker  42:34  
Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah. I didn't know about this. To be honest. I didn't, I didn't know. I was aware of the GI comparison tool, but I didn't know that it gave this much information. Again, just never had the time to go and look personally to, you know, out here and walk I probably should have. But yeah, this is a great week source for students. Is this. Is this something that I don't know if I can ask you or not? I mean, is this can students rely on this information? Like, Is this okay, to direct students here?

Unknown Speaker  43:12  
It's totally okay. I mean, I can't speak for your schools policies. But from the VA perspective, these are estimated benefits specific to your school based on the current laws. Okay, so, so like, the the estimations are correct. Okay. You know, it would depend, this is just to give you the information so that you can apply, and then your actual amount.

Unknown Speaker  43:33  
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  43:34  
yeah, I'm gonna vary. And I'm not an expert in benefits as much as the people who process the benefits. Right. Yeah. This is this is a public webpage. This is what we like this is there for specifically students, to

Unknown Speaker  43:47  
your prospective students to look at. So

Unknown Speaker  43:49  
yeah, of course. So feel free to distribute it. And you should be able to distribute that custom URL specific Glee, like if you distribute the copy and paste that URL.

Unknown Speaker  44:01  
Oh, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  44:02  
That will, that should go directly to that page. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  44:06  
I will say that. Yeah. Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  44:08  
Yep. Cool. Well, listen, those were the only things I wanted to look at with you. Do you have any questions for me about what we've looked at or discussed today? And keep in mind, I don't know a lot about benefits specific. No,

Unknown Speaker  44:20  
no. Yeah. And that's, I'm not I'm not asking anything like that. I was just very, very surprised, I guess that the comparison will give this much information that it's it, you know, it's, it's awesome, that it's accurate. And we can give this to students. So I feel very, very happy to, to know this. No, it's fantastic. Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  44:44  
Cool. And thank you for walking me through through your internal process. One of the things that I wanted to ask you as we're wrapping up, yeah, if you could go to and this is not to say this is something that we are doing yet. Sure. But it's something we've can considered. Okay, you could go to a website and verify a student's veteran status digitally, as opposed to, like, I, that's one of the reasons why I asked like, why you collect those paper forms? Like if there's a process to what you do with those forums? Yeah, if you if you could actually just go to like, the gov slash certify a student. Yeah, you put in student information, and it would say, this is their status. This is their benefit the

Unknown Speaker  45:33  
plastic because, you know, and, and one of the things to worth mentioning is like when I certify students, and, you know, all certifying officials need to do this is we get to the bio, the bio screen NBA once, and we have to input again, like, some of the information on that form, like, well, this is personal information related specifically to the student. But I'm also Chapter Chapter benefits, things of that nature on the bio screen. If, you know if there's some kind of stab or and like you said, some page that I can go to to see the veteran status of students on the BS website. That would be fantastic. I'd be fantastic. I'm all for that.

Unknown Speaker  46:19  
I want to get your exact words. That would be fantastic. I'm all for it.

Unknown Speaker  46:24  
Yeah. That's very exciting to hear. I mean, I love I love the that you guys are doing this feedback. And, you know, taking information from school certifying officials, and I love I think, to be as efficient as possible. And I think if it can be easier for everybody for the VA for school. Why not? You know, I love that. So

Unknown Speaker  46:51  
that's awesome. All right, Tim. Well, listen, I hope you have a great day. I can't thank

Unknown Speaker  46:56  
you enough for your time. Today was a huge help. And thanks for staying for a few extra minutes.

Unknown Speaker  47:01  
Have you the help? All right, Kevin. Thank you. Okay, bye bye. Take care. Have a good day. Bye.

## Northeastern
Unknown Speaker  0:00  
or questions specific to your role?

Unknown Speaker  0:05  
Alright, so that recording is officially started. So, um, let me pull up my notes here. What we're going to chat about, and what we want to learn about at the VA is, specifically behaviors and tools. So you know, the process of when you first get an inquiry from a veteran or an active duty service member, all the way through like, then starting school, we want to kind of get a sense of like a, at the highest level, what are the steps? And and what are some of the tools that you use in that step how those steps, like how you manage that process or support that process. Some of the stuff we talked about might be based on your memory. Some of it might be based on things you might do in the future. Once you've looked at some of the different websites and tools, we're just going to talk for about 15 minutes. And then we'll switch over to the web. And we might look look at some websites that you mentioned in your process. And I'll observe how you use the site. Does that make sense? Sure. Any questions before we get started? So tell me roughly about how long have you been at the institution where you're teaching, or I'm sorry, not teaching, but supporting veterans.

Unknown Speaker  1:19  
So I started here, actually, as a work study using my GI bill in 2016. And then I started full time in February of 2017.

Unknown Speaker  1:34  
And just as a rough estimate about how many veterans or service members do you or your team work with each semester,

Unknown Speaker  1:44  
each semester, it's around 700, outlets, including dependent, so using benefits as well.

Unknown Speaker  1:49  
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:52  
And I'm going to be taking notes while you chat. So I might be on a little bit of a delay. Or you might hear me talking to myself occasionally. So talk me through the process of helping a veteran or a beneficiary, you know, plan their education. And while we're like, kind of walk me through how you first get in touch with someone or someone gets in touch with you. And then if at any point along the line, you coordinate directly with that, or the Veteran Affairs Department. I'd love to hear about that.

Unknown Speaker  2:25  
Sure. So there's a couple different avenues that we reach students here at Northeastern, we have a we have a recruiter that recruits for our professional college just like our night school, our online program, that sort of thing. She recruits specifically for veterans and servicemembers. So if they come in through there, they may come through Casey. And then they sent us over to our center, we have a vet center here on campus, it's the adult day center for the advancement of veterans and service members. And then within this office, we have a couple of work studies up front are all current student veterans, myself, the associate director, and then a director and academic advisor, and then a Veteran Service Specialist. That's sort of like an all encompassing position that can help with everything. So once a student gets either they, you know, find us on our website, at their marketing materials, or word of mouth is pretty big for us. Student Veterans of America get their name out there a lot as well. So as soon as really anyone at the university or any pathway to the university here is that they're a veteran or service member, they send them over to us, we're called calves for short. So I'll probably reference that a few times. So once they get to cab, their initial usually the same few questions, you know, what's it going to cost? What's tuition? I have this many months left in my GI Bill, or I have no idea what I want to do I just, you know, I'm separating in a year, what can I do to take the steps to get into Northeastern. So it's really depending on what the service member is looking to do, or what point there at sort of dictates how we react. But when it comes to benefits, and really the only contact that we have with the VA for an incoming student is once we get a certificate of eligibility of some sort, will call this SEO hotline and verify entitlement.

Unknown Speaker  4:14  
So once we get a COE, all the

Unknown Speaker  4:20  
and obviously, if a student doesn't know how to get a CFP, we either will walk them through the process on the phone through vets.gov. And he benefits or we have a like a how to that we made that we send out to people as well. So they can log in check their entitlement, we show them how to do a screenshot so they can send us a screenshot of what they have. That's actually often a choke point that websites down a lot so that this one that sack of seems to be down our students have issues accessing their education benefits overview.

Unknown Speaker  4:59  
We'll talk about about that more in a second.

Unknown Speaker  5:02  
So you just alluded to this,

Unknown Speaker  5:06  
there's, you know, one thing we're very interested in is those kind of choke points that you're referring to. Sure. And there's two processes that I want to kind of dive into a little bit more. So one is the application to the school, you know, and that may not involve the VA at all. But I'd love to to hear about like, in the you know, when students come in either via your recruiter for professional programs, or via word of mouth or via website, you know, what are some of the points where the process slows down a little bit, just in applying to the school? And then we'll talk about the benefit application process after that.

Unknown Speaker  5:47  
Okay, sure. Yeah, so for our professional school, it's actually it's a lot smoother than it is for the other traditional, undergraduate and graduate programs at the main University, me with the main University is so competitive, so they don't accept any transfer credits, Joint Service transcript, as accreditation club tests, anything like that, whereas the professional college does, so that military recruiter in the professional college is also the admissions officer. So she from start to finish with with the veteran and working with the enrollment team, that the college has to make sure the veteran is in their classes, their you know, their account is protected from holds and all that stuff. And she coordinates with my office wants the students accepted, and their transcripts are processed, I think they have like a two to three week turnaround for transfer credit evaluations, that definitely on our end to be a little faster. We're working right now to get on the spot. Credit evaluations, pretty much the recruiter would know, you know, she's an Air Force veteran, she knows which jobs and courses would place into what classes and be able to cover it on the transcript here. But when it comes to the traditional programs, you know, we don't we don't look at veterans, we don't we don't cut the requirements to be accepted into the university just because their service member northeast has been getting very competitive in the last few years, we've been a top 40 schools. So if that has any sort of credit, even if it's not going to transfer, they'll be considered a transfer student, which sort of helps them get looked at a little differently than the traditional applicant pool amongst 18 year olds that are coming out of AP classes and all that stuff. And then we also have a specific admissions officer that although she's not just for military, she's the only one that handles military affiliated applicants. And she knows to look at you know, although high school transcripts are required that, you know, a lot of growth and change has happened since that time for most service members. But again, the choke point really there is there's not much transfer credit. And the common app is not the best as well. It's hard for some you know, you have someone that served 20 years in the military, then they're coming back to do their undergraduate degree. And they have to try and get a recommendation from a teacher or something like that from way back when it's, it's a little ridiculous sometimes. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  8:02  
Want to capture that a common thought the best teacher recommendations specific

Unknown Speaker  8:08  
after 20 years or so.

Unknown Speaker  8:12  
So what about the benefit application process? What are some of the choke points there? I think he mentioned there's a like the performance of the website. And we'll take a look at that in a second. What are some other things that were the benefit application process might slow down the overall goal?

Unknown Speaker  8:31  
It's pretty smooth. Actually, when the websites up and working, it's it seems to be pretty good. pot, if it's, you know, I try to sit on the board of directors for the National Association of veterans program administrators. So I have a lot of conversations with the VA and I know the back end of things, so I might not be the best person to speak honestly, because I sort of defend the VA a lot. But the turnaround for applications really doesn't seem that it needs to take as long as it does. Then often, you know, if it's a first time user using the benefits, and they have to wait for the cod to be mailed, they can instantly see a snapshot of what their entitlement is. And if the VA is telling schools that a snapshot of their education benefits is accurate, then I feel that should be you know, it's 2019. That can be a much faster process than waiting at least 30 days to see what education benefits you're entitled to. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  9:27  
But a lot of people,

Unknown Speaker  9:30  
yes, yeah. Thank you. Um, what are some of the most common questions you get from veterans or service members or their beneficiaries about like, either professional or traditional education?

Unknown Speaker  9:46  
Like questions about benefits? or just general questions,

Unknown Speaker  9:49  
I would say like common questions overall. And if there's a benefit question in there, that's great.

Unknown Speaker  9:53  
But it's not, that's fine. The most common question we get is, how much is this program going to cost me. So when we have a prospective student, or even someone who gets accepted and asked that question after the fact, which is dangerous, but happens, we, you know, we can sort of give a guesstimate, obviously, tuition rates increase every year. So we can sort of say this is how much it's going to be this is how many days it's going to take from your entitlement. This is where you'll be left. Thankfully, we are a full Yellow Ribbon School. So if a student is entitled, we've never turned anyone that's eligible for yellow ribbon away. And we're, it's easy that, if that's the case, we can just say, you know, your education is going to be free. But really, so your tuition questions we get, you know, how fast can I do this? Just, especially with active duty service members, you know, can I overload? Can I take more courses in one term? What's the process to do that? So we work. One of our main pillars here for our center is to be the liaison for any questions that a student veteran might have at the university. So we work closely with advising offices, and then we have an advising liaison in the office to so we get those questions answered pretty fast. But really, the other big one is, what do I need to get full? BH? How many credits Do I need to be in? What classes will that be? Northeastern has some semesters with many semesters within them. So the overlap and calculating of what housing is going to be can be tough. But it's very important here in Boston with with the cost of living being so high and the job market being so tight that most of our students are not working while they go to school. They're just trying to go full time. So then living off the BH.

Unknown Speaker  11:27  
Gotcha. And the last question you said was, what do I need to get the full? What?

Unknown Speaker  11:32  
housing allowance?

Unknown Speaker  11:34  
Yeah, that's it. That's what I thought is

Unknown Speaker  11:40  
one of the most challenging questions you get, like, among those questions, are there any that become more difficult to answer?

Unknown Speaker  11:48  
I would say the more difficult one of them are really difficult, the more I think time consuming, it's calculating or trying to give a projected calculation of what the housing would be. That's more for current students, then prospective students, for prospective students, a lot of the questions that we handle and intend to pass on our financial aid related outside of VA benefits. So specific, faster questions really are out of our realm. And then, you know, every once in a while, we'll get a student who, you know, made, made the wrong choice, and has Montgomery GI Bill and is now accepted to Northeastern that costs $30,000 a semester, and they don't know what they're going to do. And we try and help facilitate appeals or pass them on to veteran legal services. Those are tough, because a lot of times means a student has to leave the university. Things like that are more challenging, I guess. How often does that happen? Very rarely, maybe once a year, I've had one student right now that's going through the process of appealing now. And it was actually a mistake with his discharge paperwork. So he was told he wasn't eligible. But he is, but it's getting fixed. It was just, you know, a difficult process to find the right person to talk to it.

Unknown Speaker  13:01  
Yeah, I got you at the VA specifically.

Unknown Speaker  13:04  
Yep. More, or maybe the DOD, it might have been actually, I connected with a vital liaison.

Unknown Speaker  13:11  
And they took it from there.

Unknown Speaker  13:14  
Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  13:17  
Um, are there any other concerns or complaints that you hear related to administering VA benefits?

Unknown Speaker  13:25  
No, I mean, as far as applying and receiving benefits, it seems fairly smooth. You know, we are affected by the system's going down last year, we had a couple students that had delayed payments, but it was nothing too serious. But yeah, you know, overall, I think it's, it's pretty good.

Unknown Speaker  13:42  
Okay. Um, so, I know, there's a lot of websites like, school, different sites, that veterans using their process for researching schools. Um, you know, there's things like US News and World Report, and there's a department of education site, there's probably dozens, if not hundreds of them. Sure. How do you feel about when veterans provide online feedback about your school?

Unknown Speaker  14:14  
You know,

Unknown Speaker  14:17  
I don't, to be honest, I've never really gone and looked for it. So I don't know what online feedback there is out there. If there's an opportunity, you know, sometimes on Facebook and stuff will have, you know, it'll be a student that was angry with the, you know, with their, their advisor, or a professor or something like that. And they'll leave a bad review on our Facebook page, saying that, you know, the school doesn't care about veterans, when that's just not the case. So oftentimes, if they're not good reviews, there's a reason why the student wasn't happy. That was out of our control. So I take it with a grain of salt. I think that information should be out there. But I think in with any reviews system, especially, you know, with the GI Bill comparison tool, and a complaint system that's on there. I think our school has four complaints right now. And they were all solved. But there's no way to show what the complaint was whether it was actually an issue that our office did in the administration of benefits, or if it was just a student that was angry with something at the school and went and complained to the VA because they have that ability to do so. So the only I like forums, I love people sharing their opinions, because I like to try and be a glass door. But I think there should be the ability for schools to respond and sort of say, you know, without violating any HIPAA violations or anything like that, say, Well, here's actually what was going on, you know, we're here to help you that sort of thing. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  15:39  
Thank you. What do you are there any sites you look to as authority, authoritative sites, on information about your school, like sites that you feel like, are really good to verify, you know, program information about your school, other than, of course, your own website?

Unknown Speaker  16:01  
I mean, I guess, you know, I just us news just for general information about the university as a whole, not really veterans specific things. For veterans specific stuff, you know, I tend to send students to the GI Bill comparison tool. It has some numbers on there that sort of show how much we've invested. And how many students are here? And how many of you serve, so it's a nice, although not everything on there is 100%. Accurate? It's still a pretty good, reliable base and accurate enough.

Unknown Speaker  16:31  
What's that accurate, or what's not quite accurate,

Unknown Speaker  16:34  
but the only thing just that, like retention and graduation rates haven't been updated yet. So like myself, we're still showing zero even though we report graduation every time. I've been told from RELR and everything that December ish, December, January timeframe is when things will start to get updated.

Unknown Speaker  16:56  
Um, let me ask you a question about that. So when you you provide data to the LR, that's the regional

Unknown Speaker  17:06  
the state education liaison representative

Unknown Speaker  17:11  
education?

Unknown Speaker  17:15  
at the VA employee? Yeah. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  17:21  
And then that's who you get the updates on? Like, when will this be updated? You ask

Unknown Speaker  17:27  
them and they let you know, pretty much Yeah, he's like, He's our go to person if we have any issues that more questions about the VA process? Gotcha.

Unknown Speaker  17:40  
Um, do you provide information to any other sites? Like, are there any websites that you share information about your school that might be veteran targeted information or duty service member targeted information?

Unknown Speaker  17:56  
Outside of northeastern websites, nothing that really, that I know about? I know we market we do a lot of marketing. So there's probably like ads and stuff like that. I know, we're on student veterans of America's website, just with our student chapter listed there. But I don't know we have an office at Fort Bragg. So we might be on for Bragg's website as well. But we don't do a lot of the marketing in this office. So I'm not really sure where else we're listed or anything like that.

Unknown Speaker  18:24  
Gotcha. Okay. Well, let's, let's go ahead and share your screen. And if you're not familiar with zoom, I can walk you through it, there's there's usually a big Share button in the middle of the screen.

Unknown Speaker  18:38  
Oh, let's see. There it is.

Unknown Speaker  18:47  
Yeah, it looks like it's working. So what I'd like you to do, is if

Unknown Speaker  18:56  
if a veteran came in, let's say the, um, the, the web, and they came into your office, and you were meeting with them? Do you do any support with them to help them? Like research whether or not this school or this program is right for them?

Unknown Speaker  19:19  
If they if they're a prospective student in northeastern, yeah, I'll have a conversation with them about it. But I don't really show them any websites or anything

Unknown Speaker  19:26  
on the web in that process?

Unknown Speaker  19:28  
Nope. Thankfully, I was a student here at Northeastern and use my benefits just recently. So I can speak to a lot of what Northeastern has to offer and why it's a better program. Gotcha.

Unknown Speaker  19:37  
Okay. Well, let's take a look at the Student Veterans of America website. Let's pull that up. And what, once we get there, I'm going to walk you through a couple of tasks.

Unknown Speaker  19:56  
All right. So tell me why you you might send is there is there an instance where you might send a prospective student or a current student to this site,

Unknown Speaker  20:08  
current students, definitely the advisor for the student veterans organization. So during meetings, I'll share it, you know, if I see a post something specific, whether it's a leadership institute, or a good article, or something like that, I'll usually send out a blurb to my students, whether via email, or Facebook post or something, saying, hey, check this out. So as I say, we recently just this weekend sent our veteran leaders, student veteran leadership to the Boston student, Veterans of America Leadership Summit, we go the national conference every year. So just, it's really just a good way that I think for students to keep up to date with different legislation, why the VA is making all these changes, what's going on with the forever GI Bill, that sort of thing.

Unknown Speaker  20:54  
So what's an example of something a student, you would a current student, you would have them do on this side.

Unknown Speaker  21:01  
So really, just you know, going to like the News, the news tab, just reading their press releases, their blogs, things like that. It's mainly for students that are active in our Student Veterans Organization, I always just have them use that I tell them to bookmark student student veterans.org, just because it's, you know, the knowledge base.

Unknown Speaker  21:20  
Okay. And it's mostly for information retrieval. Yep. Okay, so there's not like a, there's no two way communication where they submit anything to this side, or

Unknown Speaker  21:32  
so the chapter will so are the the actual, like elected officers for the student veterans organization, if we have some sort of event or you know, host something, and we want to get the word out there will submit the I think it's on the screen now, the media and curry. And you can just like, send them a message on Facebook, and they'll share stories and stuff like that, too.

Unknown Speaker  21:52  
Okay. So if you don't mind, show me the submit a media inquiry. Show me kind of walk me through that process? And if you don't mind talking out loud when you do. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  22:01  
I actually haven't done it in a while. So I've been interesting. I have the students done a lot of it.

Unknown Speaker  22:10  
And feel free to just make up information here.

Unknown Speaker  22:13  
Well, let me go to

Unknown Speaker  22:25  
looks like you're one field I am off. No worries.

Unknown Speaker  22:57  
Work.

Unknown Speaker  23:01  
might be that that's not a, there we go. Okay. And I just want to take a look at this. And assuming this is pretty much Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  23:09  
yep. And then you just you just say what, at the bottom, if I scroll down, it's just like a box to fill out what you want to have listed what you're looking to do, and they get back to. Okay, cool.

Unknown Speaker  23:23  
We can follow up and look at that a little bit more. So let's go ahead and go to the US News and World Report, College's website.

Unknown Speaker  23:42  
And let's find your school, and

Unknown Speaker  23:47  
just want to take a look at that page with you and ask you a couple of quick questions. Okay. All right. So if you were, if you were thinking about how this represents your school, to service member or veteran, what are the things that you think they would look for, in looking at this page.

Unknown Speaker  24:19  
So this page, I don't usually have you, I'm pretty clear, it's not gonna say anything about veterans or military or anything like that. Really, here, it's just I'll go to the rankings. The big one, here you go. Number eight, most innovative school. And then especially if we have business students looking for business programs that were tapped up their undergraduate, it just sort of shows why Northeastern is, honestly helped explain the cost point. Cuz right here, that's a pretty big number for a lot of people. And then having that, having that information here and say, you know, that's our price point, these are all this is where we rank, you know, sometimes I'll filter it down, get like just a Massachusetts list and show other schools in the area. And then I can say, you know, plus, we also offer a full Yellow Ribbon Program. So we can bring that number down to zero. And you still get all this information here.

Unknown Speaker  25:13  
Yeah. Okay. That's helpful.

Unknown Speaker  25:18  
And there's there's nothing, they don't list.

Unknown Speaker  25:23  
Yellow Ribbon as a as a filter on US News, if I'm not mistaken.

Unknown Speaker  25:27  
So I don't believe so either. And I know there is, like us news best for Vets like rank, like lyst, that comes out every year. We unfortunately have not been ranked on there now. Because our we're a five year program. And a lot of that the metrics for that is set up for a four year program. And we just didn't make the cut.

Unknown Speaker  25:48  
Yeah, that's it.

Unknown Speaker  25:52  
But it sounds like if I understand you correctly, the costs, like one of the conversations you've had with folks is looking at the rankings, either, you know, overall, or against other area schools. And then using those rankings as a way of validating the costs, but then talking them through, you know, the fact that your yellow ribbon, so they're choosing between Northeastern and a non Yellow Ribbon School in Boston.

Unknown Speaker  26:18  
Exactly. Yeah. And a lot of the time, that's, you know, I don't we don't often get students coming here saying, I don't really know where I want to go, you know, students are, I'd say nine times out of 10. If they're sitting in my office, they have already either decided on Northeastern but haven't been admitted it or they're between like Northeastern Boston University, Boston College, something like that. They already get someone to tell you, they already have a lot of they know about the schools in their head already. And they're coming to see what the veteran support is.

Unknown Speaker  26:46  
Yeah. Okay. That makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  26:51  
All right, let's just go to va.gov. Okay. And this will be the last thing we do. Um, so if you were walking a veteran through taking a look at what their housing benefit would be, for example, how, how would you do that from this page?

Unknown Speaker  27:13  
I wouldn't, you wouldn't go down, I would talk them through it myself.

Unknown Speaker  27:18  
You just you just explain it to them.

Unknown Speaker  27:20  
Yep. So just, you know, we, we have like a chart that we made that sort of shows what credits needs to have in each term to be able to get to the full time. And then I just go over that, you know, the VA will prorate based off of how many days in a month, you're actually in classes, and then show them what the I would really just go to the GI Bill comparison tool to show them what the full time on ground rate is. And then I can talk them through what an estimate of their housing would be. But then I always tell students to call the VA and confirm because the VA always has the last day and what the payments actually going to be.

Unknown Speaker  27:56  
Got it. So if you are going to just get that.

Unknown Speaker  28:06  
Think I lost you.

Unknown Speaker  28:08  
Full Time estimated housing rate. I lose you.

Unknown Speaker  28:12  
Yeah, you're out there. Can you hear me?

Unknown Speaker  28:14  
Oh, sorry. Yeah, that's that's probably the connection on my end. Apologies. Can you hear me now?

Unknown Speaker  28:19  
I can. Yeah. But I missed that last part. Awesome. Awesome.

Unknown Speaker  28:23  
Yeah, I was just asking you, you said the part of the process that you would use va.gov for would be going to the comparison tool to show them the full time estimated housing rate? Oh, walk me through that process? Just do it.

Unknown Speaker  28:39  
Yeah, I usually just I just I see here that it has a link to it there. I usually just google GI Bill comparison tool and then come right to the screen. So just, you know, have them come here go through what their statuses most of the time, it's a veteran. They choose what chapter they want to use, it's almost always post 911. But our Voc Rehab numbers are increasing. And then walk them through here, just you know, just tell them to follow the prompts. I think it's pretty intuitive. It doesn't really I don't often have to walk them through how to choose what their how long they serve, that sort of thing. I do get questions from a lot of service members asking what they're going to do for a scholarship is because a lot of them think if they were a Gunnery Sergeant, it's a scholarship that they are eligible for. That's not a joke, unfortunately. So 36 months, and then always were school. So go to school, in person and online, even though we're both of them. And then down here, just type in northeastern, if you know exactly what school you're going to use. For us, we have three campuses. So depending on where they live, or where they're going to attend classes, Charlotte and Seattle are graduate campuses. So for taking undergraduate, it's always Boston. And then I tell them to click on the details. And here it is. Yeah, that's it shows what the housing is. shows them actually doesn't show exactly what our yellow ribbon is. But there is the yellow ribbon list that shows what each school and each state has. I've never have had a student asked me to see that though. I just know that it's there. Because we keep track of who offers what, in the state as well.

Unknown Speaker  30:20  
Yeah. So when you say it doesn't show exactly what the yellow ribbon is, tell me what you mean by that.

Unknown Speaker  30:27  
Like it doesn't have, like, how many slots are available at the school? And how many? Like how much the school offers up as their part? Unless there's somewhere where I'm just missing it. Last time I looked it wasn't there.

Unknown Speaker  30:43  
I don't know if it is I don't think it is. It's definitely not in the calculation on the right.

Unknown Speaker  30:47  
Okay, so here it is. Actually, if you click Yes, then it brings it down. But this is actually out of date is August 5. So we should be updated. We're now at an unlimited amount and unlimited number of students.

Unknown Speaker  31:09  
Okay, good to know. Uh, let's see.

Unknown Speaker  31:15  
I don't think I have any other questions. You know, well, let me ask one more thing about this. So let's say you've gone through this process with a veteran or a service member. And given them kind of use this as a as a as a tool in your in your planning process. What do you tell them to do next, once they've you've looked at this information together.

Unknown Speaker  31:39  
So if they haven't chosen a program yet, I tell them to definitely, you know, look at our catalog and our the university websites, whatever specific college and see how long their programs going to be. And then if they haven't applied for benefits to apply for benefits, and or call the VA to see exactly how much remaining entitlement that have. If they're sitting here with me, I'll call the hotline myself. And then you know, with them just get exactly how much entitlement they have. And then we can sort of map out exactly how much of the program, the GI Bill will cover, if they have their full GI bill that covers most of it. Now, with the new stem scholarship, that's going to be worked into the conversation as well, if they're, if that applies to them. And then really would just give like a warm handoff to their academic advisor, and then they take classes. Awesome.

Unknown Speaker  32:32  
Do you have any questions for me about what we've looked at or discussed today? Or about why we're doing this research or about anything at all?

Unknown Speaker  32:40  
Well, I mean, I'm definitely curious more for why or where, how this information is going to be used? Is this like a new VA website that might be coming? Or is this just general information, looking to see what's working and what's not?

Unknown Speaker  32:53  
Yeah, I would say it's definitely more of the ladder. We just finished a research study talking to veterans and active duty service members about their college research process, how they go from deciding, even being aware that they have a benefit they can use when they first hear about it, who it's from, and how they research, where they'd like to go to school and why they want to go to school, all the way through to the, you know, starting to attend. And now that we've talked to veterans and active duty service members, we wanted to kind of take what we learned from them in their process, and overlap that with how CEOs and counselors working in veteran support offices, kind of where they were those processes kind of mesh, and where there might be some gaps in the process. Most of it, most of our goals are related to the comparison tool, thinking about how to make this more usable, and what kind of things come up with the comparison tool. But it's interesting, like, given the normal Google behaviors that that people have, the comparison tool isn't really optimized for those kind of behaviors. So one of the things that that, you know, I think I'm thinking about as a as a researcher and designer is, what would a Northeastern University Boston landing page looked like? It was SEO optimized. So instead of, you know, veteran, finding this page via a search, you know, if this page was SEO optimized so that if I googled, I want to go to, you know, Northeastern, and Boston, and I'm sat around, and I got this page, how could this page be just as useful? Yeah. You know,

Unknown Speaker  34:46  
I heard grumblings and I think on Weems, it says that programs are going to be listed, possibly on a comparison tool moving forward, I think that would be great too, because even harder to find, then GI Bill comparison tools. Yeah, ever any functionality in the future for a student to request a new program, that would be awesome, too, because a lot of times students, they don't realize that. I mean, for one, they never knew to check to see if the program is approved. But if they don't, unfortunately, sometimes they don't get to our office until they have a bill do. So they've already gone through the process themselves. And then they don't know that their programs not approved for benefits until it's too late.

Unknown Speaker  35:30  
capture that eligible for.

Unknown Speaker  35:35  
And that's the appeals process you alluded to earlier.

Unknown Speaker  35:37  
Now, that’s more too late in terms of that tuitions not going to be paid the semester by the VA. So then, you know, for us, thankfully, we have a pretty robust financial aid package here. So we can support them with other veteran specific scholarships. But you know, if not all schools operate the way that we do. And, you know, I could put a veteran on the hook for a pretty hefty chunk of change if there programs not approved and they’re already two weeks into a term they can’t, you know, withdraw or anything like that. They’re kind of stuck with it.

Unknown Speaker  36:07  
So program approval,

Unknown Speaker  36:10  
right? Yeah. Like if they if they are able to see if looking at the Northeast or Boston website, right there additional resources, if there’s a link that says, approved programs, and they look on that, and they say, Well, you know, I was looking at a Bachelor’s in bioinformatics, but I don’t see it on approved programs, one that would either drive them to call the school, call me, and then I can start the process with the essay to get the program approved. Or if there’s ever a way that the student could, you know, if it’s like request program approval and just send an email to the to the CEO that can start the process that would be much more streamlined. But something saying your program must be approved to receive benefits, and then showing it’s not on a list would go a long way.

Unknown Speaker  37:00  
Thank you. That’s really helpful.

Unknown Speaker  37:03  
All right.

Unknown Speaker  37:04  
Well, I don’t have any other questions for you. So we can, we can wrap up a few minutes early. But thank you so much for your time today. This is a it’s a it’s a huge help and us trying to get these tools kind of iterating them into the most useful state that can be for veterans and for the people that support them.

Unknown Speaker  37:22  
So thank you. Yeah, absolutely. Happy to have a good week.

Unknown Speaker  37:26  
You as well. Thank you. Bye bye.

## UMBC (1 of 2)
=Unknown Speaker  0:02  
Um, so what we're going to talk about is behaviors and maybe websites that you've used in supporting veterans in their educational goals. And some of the stuff you share, it might be kind of like your knowledge of the process. How long have you been with you? MBC in this role?

Unknown Speaker  0:20  
So I've actually been at you MBC, just over a year, I came in July of last year.

Unknown Speaker  0:26  
And yeah.

Unknown Speaker  0:28  
And were you doing this kind of work before? I was

Unknown Speaker  0:31  
not. Prior to this, I was working for the federal government, I was working for the Department of Agriculture and transition into an educational role, I've always been very, a very large proponent of education, and a very large proponent of supporting underrepresented populations in education. So the nature of the work that I do

Unknown Speaker  0:52  
here, as you can see is very cool.

Unknown Speaker  0:56  
Very good. Um, so I'm going to ask you, maybe if, you know, five or six questions just to kind of learn about, you know, the process of you as us, you've acclimated to it, and maybe, you know, made some changes to it over the last year of your time there. And then we might look at some websites that help you in the work that you do with veterans, um, roughly about how many veterans or service members does you MBC work with each term or semester, you guys, I'm assuming around like a fall spring semester schedule?

Unknown Speaker  1:31  
We are? And admittedly, that's a very difficult question to answer. And I'll tell you why. The reason it's a difficult question to answer is because you MBC utilizes the common app, which is an application that's very prominent amongst a wide variety of schools. And as it pertains to, as it pertains to service members, affiliation, and things of that nature is self reporting. So there is not necessarily a requirement that or you can require that they, that they disclose what branch of the military, they are associated with any. And then after that there is so there, there's one barrier right there. And the differentiation here between veterans, between independence between active duty and things like that, on paper is very difficult to discern, because the main thing they that movies he looks at is certifications in terms of like how many veterans students are being served and things of that nature. So with specificity, I can definitely pinpoint that. However, I will probably need I do have an answer to that question, because we have a demographics reported that was just developed for the purpose specifically for the purpose of counting the amount of veterans that are on campus. And as a newer report. So later in the conversation, if you'll give me a moment to bring that report up, I can answer maybe with a bit more insight specificity. But I said all that to say, the way in which the way in which designations are made to veteran dependent, and those that are using certification versus those who are not versus those who have not chosen to identify their branch or military affiliation, may say a kind of convoluted process. However, we are very regularly having discussions with admissions with different offices on campus, as it pertains to a more surefire way to get it to be able to answer that in terms of veterans who utilize sort of who utilize benefits. Last semester, I believe it was about 280 students with a large majority of those students being male, so maybe closer to 200 of those students were male and 80 of those students were were women. However, like I said, I do have a report that I have access to, that I can circle back around towards the end of this conversation to Okay, potentially give you a better idea of what that number looks like. But I would say that the common app and the way that the verbiage is, on the time and a half is actually kind of a barrier in terms of the selections that it allows people to make regarding the classification of their military service. So So that's this just kind of give you some perspective. And actually, as we talk, I'm going to be looking for the reports that are reference.

Unknown Speaker  4:32  
Yeah. And the report, we don't need like a specific number, just a rough estimate of you have like, roughly, you know, just under 300 active beneficiaries are students that are that are either veterans or military affiliated. And then you have a much larger number of prospective students that you're dealing with. And that one is difficult to track down because of the common app. That's that's the kind of information that I'm looking for. So walk me through the process. So like, if you're going to just give me the chapter headings, or each of the steps in the process, from when you first learned about a potential a prospective student who is a veteran, all the way through to them getting started in classes, you know, how do you first hear about them? What services do you provide to them? And then along the way, you know, what are the the main steps in the process.

Unknown Speaker  5:26  
So I just want to provide clarification, the way that things are structured here, your VC the support, that veterans receive his crew very decentralized, though, within the last year, a lot of my efforts have been moving towards actually decentralizing those things. In terms of certifications, I do not handle certifications, that's actually something that's handled out of the registrar. And we do have a certifying official, and specifically with the context of his job, all that he does he certifications and making sure that veterans receiving the appropriate benefits and things of that nature, whereas my office is transitioning specifically into programming for veterans. So in terms of veteran students that are coming in, and one of the things that I'm working on is sending them some early communications in terms of places they can find support, our office can be of support, things of that nature, we also have a welcome reception, or veteran students. And we also reach out to different campus partners with specificity to those that would have services that they will utilize to give them some perspective about different areas they have that they can go on campus for different supports and things like that. So University Health Services, Career Services, different centers on campus. For those looking for civic engagement opportunities, and things like that are typically the usual players as usual players with that type of events. Throughout the year, we have a variety of different events for them to kind of gain community because veterans here at UBC tend to be very independent, and they really enjoy spending time alongside other veterans. So we have a coffee and conversation series that is run by our veteran student graduate assistant, who is who we just hired for that position.

Unknown Speaker  7:25  
A former member of the

Unknown Speaker  7:27  
Army or when I hear you say his benefits, and he's going to be leading a lot of that conversation, we have a hell of a farewell ceremony for veterans that are graduating throughout the year, we will have we will just have a variety of different types of activities depending on what kind of year it is a Veterans Day at a sporting event, or excuse me, a veterans recognition of a sporting event. And we also have a veterans week, which is a week full of events that coincides with Veterans Day. And we'll have different like, I learned celebrations and opportunities for veterans to, to communicate and collaborate and things of that nature. So largely, my my office specifically focuses on programming. But we're also kind of branching out, we just recently started our Student Veterans Association, which is called the retreat vets since we the retrievers This is just people from different different military backgrounds who were just officially recognized as an organization. So I'm inviting I'm advising that organization and providing them with some support in terms of resources and information and stuff like that. So we're in the process of getting that off the ground. And we are also in the process of establishing a veterans lounge on campus, which is notable, because that has not that has never been a fixture on your VCs campus. So I'm excited to say that over the course of this next semester, hopefully, we will be getting that space to where it needs to be in terms of making different renovations and having a dedicated space on campus for veteran students. And lastly, something else. And a lot of these things are newer initiatives, because as I said, I've only been in this position for a year. And not only do I serve this population, I also serve commuter students, transfer students and adult learners, all of which are very sensitive population. Sure, you see. So what was I doing? So I am in the process of reestablishing the veteran faculty and staff group, which is just basically comprised of people all over campus, who can provide different types of supports and opportunities to veterans, since there's not that centralized sense. You can go to this one singular space and get all of these different things, I feel like it's all been more important to ensure that we are meeting and discussing amongst one another how we can can best utilize the resources that we do have currently. But those resources are growing. And I've seen that over the over this last year that I've been here. So I'm excited for what's coming forward.

Unknown Speaker  10:12  
Right? So just so I'm reflecting what's the what is the name of your office, what's the title of the office,

Unknown Speaker  10:20  
as it currently stands, my offices, OC ss, which stands for off campus Student Services,

Unknown Speaker  10:27  
okay. And you are

Unknown Speaker  10:31  
just from what I understand, you are responsible for posts post acceptance, you know, they've started taking classes, helping facilitate connections between veterans and resources on campus veterans and each other, who are students as well as faculty students, and facilitating a lot of the events that happen while they're in school, you're not directly involved in in as much the application and acceptance process before they get to school. Is that correct?

Unknown Speaker  11:05  
That is largely that is largely handled by admissions, and anything dealing with certification is is handled by the registrar, and more so interact with veterans, along the lines of what you said, I'm, I'm a part of the Division of Student Affairs here. So just making sure that they're being involved in different things that could encourage retention among their population is largely my role here, as well as with my other three populations.

Unknown Speaker  11:36  
Yeah, I gotcha. What are some of the most common questions you get from veterans and service members that are students.

Unknown Speaker  11:43  
Um, um,

Unknown Speaker  11:45  
so a lot of a lot of times it has to deal with

Unknown Speaker  11:51  
their benefits. So in the past, and this is the processes being refined, especially as pertains to technology and things like that, in the past, my office has assisted with certification in terms of providing some preliminary information to the registrar. So being that now we're working on focusing on programming and creating community I campus and we completely relinquish that responsibility to the registrar's office, a lot of times people will still send me like kind of certifications and things like that or have questions as it pertains to anything veteran related on campus. So some of those questions include, where can I go for assistance with certification? Is there any type of other any type of mental health related services on campus that I can utilize? A lot of questions do revolve around Is there a veteran space? And while there is not currently, that is currently, why there isn't one currently, as it stands, that's something that is going to be happening very, very. So. Really, like I said, for the most part a lot, veterans are very, very independent. So it's a I'll see them at events and things like that. And they're more so looking for ways to get engaged on campus and ways to spend more time amongst other veterans. But with them being so independent, a lot of their questions is really had to do with certification. And, you know, just general considerations for getting around campus. Depending on that level of comfort, they may disclose things that they're facing challenges with and things of that nature, but it just kind of varies from person to person. Gotcha.

Unknown Speaker  13:34  
Okay, what are the some of the challenges that you've heard about?

Unknown Speaker  13:38  
I would say, making a transition from the armed services, which, which, as I understand it, are very, very structured, and have a very high degree of specificity in terms of what's supposed to happen on any given day, versus transitioning to a university environment, which is, in some ways, a lot more fluid and does not have that level of rigidity, that, that the service members are particularly familiar with some mental health concerns, and, and some financial concerns as well, with benefits maybe have not shaken out in a quick manner. In some, in some facets, a difficulty in terms of finding support with Veteran Affairs has been a challenge as well. But yeah, it kind of varies, a lot of them, disclose those challenges too often, often, whoever is in the place of our veteran services graduate assistantship and our last one he just recently graduated. And in general, I prefer to have someone who has served in the military in their role, and we just actually hired, hired a student hired a student who served in the army, and he is familiar with a lot of the those different types of considerations having served themselves. So in many cases, they will disclose that information amongst, you know, people that are a part of their community rather than rather than like, kind of General Administration. So those are, those are a few of the challenges I hear. You know, it just a tip things that could be applicable to different populations transitioning back into school after being out for so long. You know, just things that are common to transfer students, which in many cases military students are. So

Unknown Speaker  15:34  
when you were talking about finding support with Veterans Affairs has been a challenge from time to time, what are some of the concerns and complaints that you hear about either indirectly through the graduate assistant or directly from veterans related to administrative benefits?

Unknown Speaker  15:50  
Um,

Unknown Speaker  15:52  
so I would say, I don't know, I don't have a high degree of specificity there. But I think you know, some of it is maybe finding the right individual for the type of support that a veteran may be looking for. And also, in some cases, navigate you know, navigating the website in the past, that is something I have heard, just like kind of navigating beside and getting things to work. And in like I say it in most cases as it pertains to certification, and most veterans are just looking for their benefit. So if something hasn't shaken out, in that regard, it can be difficult for them to find the

Unknown Speaker  16:29  
right person to

Unknown Speaker  16:30  
receive assistance from. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  16:37  
Do any of the veterans that you've worked with, do they

Unknown Speaker  16:41  
share?

Unknown Speaker  16:43  
Online feedback about your school in public websites? Like nice calm is an example of one of those are, you know, there are others but websites that display student feedback? Is that something that you've seen them do or is that something you pay attention to,

Unknown Speaker  17:00  
admittedly, is not something that I have intentionally searched out, but I have not just come across any, any sentiments, as it pertains to those things online. I'm also here them and like I said, I just got here a year ago, when I got here, the general sentiment was, you know, you MBC doesn't really support veterans in a in a very good way. And I can understand that because a lot of a lot of community colleges in the area have dedicated veterans centers, dedicated veterans support, and things of that nature, because that's often a first draft for me veterans, and you MBC doesn't have anything that is centralized in that regard, though, I would say, with a lot of efforts and successes we've been able to make since since that I've since I've been here over the course of this year, there's something that is slowly changing. I'm very diligently trying to make that kind of atmosphere for veterans on campus, you MBC definitely wants to support camp, do you support veterans, but structurally, as it stands, it's like I said, it's just very decentralized, things are like there's no, there's no clarity in terms of the type of support that veterans can reasonably expect to receive. But I would also just say that a lot of that is lack of guidance in terms of structure, promoting those services to veterans and things like that, which is why I'm in the process of reenact and get veteran faculty and staff interest group just to make sure that people are like on the same page, and that I can confidently, I can confidently link things to the veterans website, and say, like, these are some people that you can reach out to if you're in need of support, they have experience talking to veterans, these are some resources you can utilize. And they know that XYZ, you know, so that's, that's what we're working towards, but she's not there yet.

Unknown Speaker  18:58  
That's it. Are there any websites that you refer veterans to that provide kind of that overview on on what's available to them? Like, is there is there a part of the you MBC site that is a good kind of centralized place of information, if not services?

Unknown Speaker  19:19  
So yes, it's veterans that you mbc.edu. And it is running out of it is run out of this office. But the websites are in the process of being updated. So a lot of initiatives I was referring to in terms of getting buy in from other departmental units and things like that. Those are the types of resources specific to campus that I want to list on the website, and my incoming graduate assistant, that is going to be focusing on doing veterans programming, he has very close ties to the VA, and he very routinely works alongside the DA. So I'm looking to implement more related resources with prominence on their website. So So yeah, that's currently what we have. And it serves largely as perspective for how to get a lot of the

Unknown Speaker  20:14  
dedicated support here is ensuring that veterans get their benefits, because that's most important to them most of the time. And in many cases, that dictates how they feel about the level of support they're receiving here, in terms of, you know, absurd, I would like to go to school, making sure

Unknown Speaker  20:33  
that that gets done in a clear in China is a process that has been before I got here is a process that was not super clear. And I would say that we're probably the best we ever have been in terms of making sure that we're providing clear instructions to veterans in that regard, and clear information about where they came in the process. But VI resources as well. So something else that a new graduate, actually just had a conversation about two days ago. So he gets on board in a little over a week, that's actually going to be

Unknown Speaker  21:08  
one of the primary areas that we're focusing on right now.

Unknown Speaker  21:18  
And just taking notes while you speak. So I might be there might I might be on a little bit of a delay.

Unknown Speaker  21:25  
Here. Are there any websites that you update? Or that your office updates that are outside of the you MBC site, but websites that you post information to regarding what kind of student experiences available for veterans at you MBC?

Unknown Speaker  21:44  
As it stands, anything external out of the DC website? No. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  21:53  
So, so far in our conversation, the only website you've mentioned, that you might point veterans to is this was a veteran start you mbc.edu correct.

Unknown Speaker  22:05  
Yeah. And on their

Unknown Speaker  22:06  
website, there are also listings for different scholarships, different

Unknown Speaker  22:09  
VA programs and things of that nature. So it does have some resources on the website, but I would just more so point them to that as a hub for some resources that they can expect to find on caches would Yes,

Unknown Speaker  22:22  
yeah, let's, um, let's go ahead and share your screen. So there should be a share button in the middle of the zoom window.

Unknown Speaker  22:33  
Okay, and then you can click on the upper left corner, it's usually monitor screen or something like that. And then the lower right corner has a share screen button should be loading up. There we go. So there's the site right there. Yep, I can see it. Okay. So what I'd like you to do is kind of imagine that, you know, if I'm a veteran, you're walking me through this site for the first time, like, what kind of things would you point out?

Unknown Speaker  23:06  
So, as it currently stands, when I got here, this is pretty much the format of the website. And the first thing, like I said, it points to is making sure that your benefits are taken care of. And in most cases, when people come to our office for anything, just by virtue of us supporting veterans and things of that nature, they assume that we deal with their benefit. So like, we provide this checklist as a means for them to from step one, step two, step 12 know exactly how the process works of you MBC. So a lot of the interactions that we received here at the office revolve around that kind of thing. It talks about, like, we have a page dedicated to educational benefits, which links to the VA education page, and different websites, Yellow Ribbon Program, and different types of benefits that they can expect to receive, both specific to the VA in Maryland, and just in general, and different scholarships, and things of that nature. So this is the list that I definitely need to update because I actually think this link is dead. But these are reoccurring scholarships that veterans can apply for, especially like stem based scholarships, because you see is a pretty

Unknown Speaker  24:22  
stem heavy school. And that's where a lot of

Unknown Speaker  24:25  
that's where a lot of the focus is dedicated to, I would also got them towards this form. In the past, this was a form that we would take, and we deliver to certification efficiently so that they can handle it. But just with the high level of detail in these reports and things like that the personally identifiable information and strengths of the office that are working, and as it currently stands, it did not make sense.

Unknown Speaker  24:57  
It did not make sense for us to,

Unknown Speaker  25:00  
for us to keep that process. Because it just it was just a it was just a risk for security breach and things of that nature. So that that is a service that is now been moved over to the registrar's office, different resources, this is the portion of the website that I'm that I said that I wanted to update. So it has some general things about things on campus and stuff like that, but nothing was specificity to this is what you can expect to talk to, that can empathize with your background, and such and such, and so on and so forth. And these are the these are largely live on campus resources, it also has not been reflected to update our veterans student association or any of the specific programming that off campus Student Services does for veterans. And that's that's one thing that is a that is in the works. And this is just different campus resources that that veteran students can make better within a close vicinity to you MBC. And this is the FAQ, and it goes over things regarding benefits. What if I, you know, in active duty, and I and I got deployment orders, and I have to come back later, what does that look like as such and such as on and so forth? Yeah, so these are, these are basically a lot of resources and things around certification. But the way that I envision the way that I'm vision, this site is just kind of like a portion of the One Stop Shop in terms of what they can expect to find socially, academically, and things of that nature, on campus to them.

Unknown Speaker  26:47  
Gotcha.

Unknown Speaker  26:55  
That's really helpful. And it's the one of the most interesting things about you are sharing you MBC is that because the responsibility for the certification and benefit administration sits in the registrar and the admissions office, as I understand it, and you provide a service that's more about student experience and and Student Life Support, academic support, connecting with other veterans that are students or faculty, that you do get a lot of questions that really you can't answer. Or you're not able to, you're able to get them to the right person. But you're not able to resolve their problem directly.

Unknown Speaker  27:40  
Is that correct? It depends on the nature of the issue. In any case,

Unknown Speaker  27:44  
I mean, it's about benefits, you wouldn't be able to resolve it, you would just put send them to the correct person.

Unknown Speaker  27:49  
Yeah. So you know, somebody who's like, Hey, I submitted my benefits paperwork, and it hasn't come through yet. There's not something that I can directly assist with, because we do

Unknown Speaker  27:57  
programming.

Unknown Speaker  27:58  
Yeah, I got you that separation of programming, you know, separation of programming for that, and

Unknown Speaker  28:10  
administration of benefits.

Unknown Speaker  28:13  
And I'm curious, like, I've talked to, I think, five other schools, and there are some schools were that separate, and some schools where that isn't. So as I learned more about, you know, that separation and how it affects, you know, the veteran success in terms of getting their application and benefit. Problem solved. That's just an interesting distinction, that I'm still learning about to thank you.

Unknown Speaker  28:40  
It depends on just real quick, I'm in a, I'm in a kind of a registrar's, and other people who work for the benefit of veterans throughout the state of Maryland. And like, some schools are structure like ours, other it's just under one. Others similar to ours, we don't have a secondary certifying official or something like that.

Unknown Speaker  29:03  
So. So yeah, I'm still learning a little bit about that as well. But because of my involvement

Unknown Speaker  29:10  
in that group,

Unknown Speaker  29:12  
one thing I'm hoping that we're able to work towards is just like I said, that one centralized kind, of course, that I was alluding to earlier in the conversation.

Unknown Speaker  29:22  
Yeah. And when you say a centralized group, do you mean handling both benefit administration issues, as well as student life issues together?

Unknown Speaker  29:33  
Yes, that's what I would love that happened. But

Unknown Speaker  29:38  
it's not impossible.

Unknown Speaker  29:43  
Yeah, yeah, I understand. Um, well, those are all the questions that I had. There's not anything else that I want to look at with you today. Do you have any questions for me about why we're doing this researcher or anything that that you'd like to know about? I am not an expert in VA benefits. I know a little bit about education benefits. But I'm more involved in the design of supporting the design of the website and tools on the website related to the administration of benefits.

Unknown Speaker  30:15  
So any questions you have for me that I can answer?

Unknown Speaker  30:19  
Honestly, you'll be very helpful. As you're familiar with website design, it there any considerations that I should absolutely have, in terms of our veterans website, because that's a project that I'm currently working on. Largely, excuse me, cotton was largely by myself. So any insight that you have in terms of how to make that an effective tool for veterans students would be of particular interest to me. But I'm

Unknown Speaker  30:48  
past that also, also the bit of perspective about

Unknown Speaker  30:51  
why you're doing doing this research and what you hope to gain from it.

Unknown Speaker  30:56  
Let me do the latter one first, and then I'll do the former. So in terms of the recent, what we're doing, is we are looking across the entire the entire journey of a veteran, or, you know, a military affiliated person from when they first learned about the fact that they have benefits at all, all the way through their career goals, and how the educational accomplishments can support that goal, kind of looking at all the steps along the way, how they interact with the VA at certain parts of the process, and thinking about their ways to make this a better process. So an example of the kinds of the kinds of things that we think about from from our conversation, is that certainly new students when they are coming in for the first semester, there's often a delay based on you know, the sequence by which they apply for benefits and apply for the school, or vice versa. We want to make sure that we support, whatever sequence happens, we want to make sure that it's that it's seamless, right now, because of the fact that the the certificate of of eligibility letter is a physical letter that creates some slow down in the process, we're investigating, you know, what a digital letter might look like. So how could we create a place, and this isn't something we've done or are planning on doing, but it's the kind of thing that we're developing a concept around? What if a school certifying official could go to a authenticated place where they could log in and provide a veteran's information and see what their eligibility is, without having to wait for that eligibility certificate from the VA directly, just kind of kind of making the process better. So that's, that's kind of an example of one of many things that we're looking at trying to improve. There are things around best benefit estimation, and housing, benefits and other things that are in as well. In terms of the website, I would say, there's lots of things I can suggest. One thing I would think about is don't think about like, one of the one of the parts of the process of making a website is thinking about how you're going to organize the information, both organizing it on a page and organizing it across multiple pages. And one of the mistakes that I see a lot in website design is that people organize information based on how they know the information, but not based on the way that a veteran might think about the information. So the way that you might know the information is by the different departments at the school, you know, who the registrar is, where the Mental Health Services Office is, our health care, you know, the nurses office or the the health center. So you might, by default, you might think, oh, I'll organize this information by you know, the offices on campus. And that's common on a lot of university websites. One of the things that's helpful to think about is, well, how would a veteran organize this information? And you can even kind of sit down with one or a few, a bunch, ideally? and ask them, you know, you know, what are the kinds of categories of things you look for? And how do you group them together? So, for a veteran mental health, and healthcare might be one thing, like, they might think, Oh, I need help. So, you know, your website navigation might be like, you know, do you need help with healthcare, mental health? Do you need help with academic support? Do you need help with benefit resolutions, or benefits issues, and then, you know, structuring it that way, it gets them to what they're looking for faster. If the websites doing its job that might ideally prevent them from contacting you at all. So that, you know, if they, if people are contacting you for a thing that you can't help them with, but you can help them get to the right person, that's what the website should do, it should kind of help them get to the right person, without needing to do. The other thing I would say that's a good practice with website design, doesn't have anything to do with content, is make sure that you look at how the website looks and feels on a lot of different kinds of technology.

Unknown Speaker  35:34  
Like, the best way to do that is to think about what a veteran wants to do on the site. So like, a veteran wants to come to the website and find, you know, when is the next meetup or event for the faculty and veteran student group, our faculty and veteran faculty and student group that you said, You are kind of re instantiated. See what it's like to do that on a laptop or a regular desktop computer, but also see what it's like to do it on a phone and see if it's different. See if it's as easy or if there are problems and finding information. Just doing it on a mobile phone. These days, most people are going to be looking at websites more often on their phones than on computers, depending on what the website is and what the uses. With the exception of things like filling out an application. They're more, they're more likely to get stuff on the phone. So that's always a good practice. Are those some helpful ideas?

Unknown Speaker  36:37  
Now this is that's actually a really good start. So I appreciate your perspective on that. Because like I said, this is largely

Unknown Speaker  36:45  
something that I'm taking on

Unknown Speaker  36:47  
by myself with the system. Yeah. design department and Student Affairs, they'll be

Unknown Speaker  36:53  
actually crash on it looks like but in terms of the content, that's

Unknown Speaker  36:57  
what I'm picking up by myself. So that needs to be it gives you some good perspective starting

Unknown Speaker  37:02  
now. Thank you. Yeah, sure. One of the ways that we organize information on the VA website, and I know, we can always make it better. But if you go to va.gov, slash education, you'll see on that page, there's kind of three big categories of information. There's, like, you know, I want to get a thing that I don't have, I want to manage something that I do have. And then there's other stuff. So like, you know, it's sometimes it's good to think in a more abstract level, like, what do veterans not have, that you MBC that they might want, like, you know, meet other veterans might be an example or meet other student, veterans, veterans students? What, you know, they might want to sign up for an email newsletter, but they don't currently get is that something that you do specifically for veterans? So it could be like, you know, get connected, you know, manage your problems, or, you know, solve problems, and other other good health, like other information and resources. So anyway, I mean, there's lots of ways to organize information, the best way to do it is the way that the audience you're trying to get to use it. It's the way they think about it.

Unknown Speaker  38:22  
Okay, okay, that's very helpful. Thank you very much.

Unknown Speaker  38:25  
My pleasure. Thank you so much for making the time to do this call today. You know, always feel free to. I mean, if you have other questions about the VA, you can reach out to me personally, or folks in the education services department. And especially if there’s via website feedback that you have. I will we’re always looking for that kind of feedback.

Unknown Speaker  38:49  
Okay, okay. Yeah, that would actually be great. If you would be open to it, I would love to kind of continue talking about like some of the efforts that we’re trying to expand in terms of supporting our veteran population, our campus and things like that. So if you would be, if you’d be open to it, maybe

Unknown Speaker  39:09  
not appreciate it. That’s totally fine. Yeah, feel free, I would say, you know, the email that I reached out to you and with originally, if you send me an email, if you wanted to set up a time to chat, I’m happy to, I’m happy to, you know, share, if there’s things we’re learning at the VA that would be helpful to you, you know, in our research, if it’ll help us serve veterans better than we’re all on the same team.

Unknown Speaker  39:33  
Okay, great. Thank you so much. And I hope the information I provide it was,

Unknown Speaker  39:37  
it was very helpful have definitely helpful in terms of understanding how sometimes veterans have to navigate structure of services within a college as an extra step. It’s not just like, the connection between the college and the VA, but it’s also the connections that happen between like a registrar’s office and a student Student Life Office. So that’s super helpful. And, and there’s there’s a few other things in there that were also helpful as well. So thank you again, I hope you have a great weekend.

Unknown Speaker  40:10  
Oh, you do as well. Have a great rest of your day. Okay, bye bye.
