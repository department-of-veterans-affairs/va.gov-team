### Introduction
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kevin and I may also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we’re going to talk about how you’ve worked with Veterans to help them learn about benefits they have related to their education, and supported them in making decisions about their educational goals.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet schools’ and Veterans’ needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and our audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. [Once recording],

My screen is now being recorded.

**Framing and background**

(Approx. 15 minutes)
We’re going to be talking primarily about behaviors and tools you may have used related to helping Veterans pursue their educational goals. We want to get a sense of the entire way you manage the process, so some of the answers you share may be based on your memory of what you’ve done in the past, and some of the answers might be based on what you might do in the future.

After about 15 minutes of chatting or so, we’ll switch over the the web, and I’m going to ask you to show me some of the things you may have remembered doing, or things you think you’d do to do this kind of work.

Any questions before we get started?

1. Tell me about your work at [Institution name]
Started here as a work-study, using TI bill in 2015, full time in Feb 2017
2. Roughly how many Veterans or service members to you or your team work with each term or semester?
Each semester around 700, including dependents
3. Talk me through the process of helping a Veteran plan their education here, at a high level. Let’s make sure we note any specific touchpoint you may have with the VA.
* Avenues that we reach students
	* Recruiter, recruits for night school, online, professional programs, recruits Vets and Service Members
	* Find us on websites
	* Word of Mouth
	* Student Veterans of America
* Vet Center for students on Campus
* We have work studies up front, work with Veterans
* Veteran SErvice Advisor
* We are called “CADS” for short
	* What’s it gonna cost, tuition
	* This many months left in GI Bill
	* I have no idea what I want to do, what steps do I need to take to get here
* Benefits, the only contact we have with the VA, once we get a COE call the hotline verify entitilement
* If a student doesn’t know how to get a COE, we will walk through the process on the phone, or we have a how to that we made, we show them how to do a screen shot, that’s often a choke point
* Vets.gov, that seems to be down a lot, students have difficulty accessing their educational 
4. What are some of the most common or difficult challenges you encounter during the _school_ application process for a Veteran?
* Professional school is a lot smoother
* Main university is so competitive, no transfer credits, but the professional college does
* She’s also the admissions officer, the recruiter, makes sure the Veteran is in the classes, once accepted and transcripts are processed, they have a 2 to 3 week transfer evaluations, the recruiter knows which jobs and courses place into what classes
* Traditional programs, we don’t look at Veterans, we don’t cut requirements for service members, it’s competitive, top 40 school, any credit makes them a transfer student, we have a specific admissions officer that handles military applicants, they know that a lot of growth and change has happened for service members. *
* The common app is not the best, teacher recommendation after 20 years or so
5. What are some of the most common or difficult challenges you encounter during the _benefit_ application process for a Veteran?
* VA.gov - 
* It’s pretty smooth when the websites up and working. I sit on the board of directors of the VCO, I know the back end of things, I defend the VA a lot, the turn around for applications, they can’t instantly see a snapshot of the entitlement, if the VA is telling schools, that a snapshot of benefits could be accurate. We could do better than 30 days. 
6. What are the most common questions you get from Veterans and service members?
* How much is going to cost me? 
	* Give a guesstimate, days from entitlement, yellow ribbon is supported here, if they qualify we can say 
* How fast can I do this? Can I overload, take more courses in one term? 
	* Our goal/pillar: Be the liaison for any questions a student might have
* What do I need to get the full housing allowance.  How many semesters do I need? Very imp. In Boston with the Cost of Living being so high, most students, 
7. What are the most challenging questions you get?
* Calculating of housing benefits, more for current students than prospective students, 
* We pass on a lot of financial aid questions FAFSA questions, they are out of our realm
* Every once in a while, we get a Montgomery GI Bill, Veteran’s legal services/appeals, things like that are more challenging, happens once a year? 
	* Difficult process to find the right person at the VA or DOD to talk to 
8. What kinds of concerns or complaints to you hear related to administering their benefits from the VA?
* No. Applying and receiving, it seems fairly smooth. A few students that had delayed payments, overall 
9. How do you feel about online Veteran feedback about your school?
(If necessary: some school information sites (niche.com for example) display student feedback. Veterans we have talked to say this is an important part of their research and decisions making. Does your school pay attention to user feedback online?)
* I’ve never looked for it. I don’ know what there is out there. If there is an opportunity on Facebook, a student that twas angry with their advisor/professor, leave a bad review on our Facebook page. Often if there are bad reviews, I take it with a grain of salt, review system, especial with GIBCT - there’s no way to show if the complaint was our office, or if it was a student that complained to the VA about something not school related. I love people sharing the opinions, but there should be the ability for the school to respond, without FERPA violations. 
10. What sites do you look to as the authoritative sites on school information?
* US News
* Vet specific - GIBCT, not always acrrucate, but it’s accurate enough 
	* Retention and grad. Rates haven’t been updated yet, even though we report every term
	* December/Jan is wen things will start to get out that. 
		* Provide data to the State Education Liaison Representive (VA Employee)
		* He’s our go to person if we have questions about the VA 
11. Do you check websites like online portals to update or verify information posted about your school? Do you send or share information about your school with other sites organizations?
* Outside of NE Websites, we do a lot of marketing, probably Google Ads
* Student Veterans of America Website
* We have an office at Fort Bragg, we might be on that website
(Transition to observed usage of the web, approx. 30 min)

12. Let’s say you’re ready to help a Veteran do some research online regarding their education. What would you do?

(Observe and note usage up to three websites, note searches, paths, and clicked items)

For each website used (Up to three that are not  [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) ):

Website 1: Student Veterans of America Website

* Hey check this out
* We just this weekend sent our Student Vet leadership tot he leadership summit
* National Conference every year
* Good way to keep up with legislative changes 
* Mainly for students who are active in the Student Vets org. 
* Information retrieval 
* The chapter will submit things to the site, the elected officers for the SVA, we want to get the word out there, the media inquiry, 

1 Tell me what you found appealing about that website.
2 Do you feel like it answered common questions or would be helpful in planning? 
3 (If not found via Google, and not a first time visit) Where did you first hear about this website?
4 What would you advise the Veteran or service member to do next with the information they’ve gathered at this site?

Website 2: US News

* Most Innovative School, 
* Helps explain the cost point
* Having those rankings page - 
* Sometimes I’ll filter against other ma schools, we can bring that number down to zero, 
There is the US News Best for Vets, we haven’t been ranked, the metrics for that are set up for a four year program


We don’t get students that say “I don’t know where I want to go” or it’s down to 2 choices, between BU, BC or Northeasters

1 Tell me what you found appealing about that website.
2 Do you feel like it answered common questions or would be helpful in planning? 
3 (If not found via Google, and not a first time visit) Where did you first hear about this website?
4 What would you advise the Veteran or service member to do next with the information they’ve gathered at this site?

Website 3:

1 Tell me what you found appealing about that website.
2 Do you feel like it answered common questions or would be helpful in planning? 
3 (If not found via Google, and not a first time visit) Where did you first hear about this website?
4 What would you advise the Veteran or service member to do next with the information they’ve gathered at this site?

13. (If they don’t use  [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) ) Let’s take a look at the Veteran’s Affairs website, and see what’s available here to help Veteran’s in planning and meeting their educational goals.
 (Observe and note searches, paths, and clicked items)

Va.gov

* Wouldn’t use this, we have a chart they made, to show them what credits they need each term, the VA will prorate based on how many, go to the GI BCT to show them full time, tell the to call the VA to confirm
* Usually Google GIBCT
* Status
* Chapter, almost always Post 9/11, but Voc Rehab are increasing
* Pretty intuitive, I don’t have to walk them through, 
* People asking about Fry Scholarship because they think 
* Undergrad is always Boston, click on view details
* Shows them housing, doesn’t show exactly what our Yello Ribbon is, 
* Doesn’t have how many Yellow Ribbon slots and how much the school offers up on their part
* If you click yes, it’s out of date, now we are an unlimited amount, unlimited number of students

Tell me what you found appealing about  [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) .
1 Do you feel like it answered common questions or would be helpful in educational planning? How?
2 Have you used this website before for this purpose? Where did you first hear about this website?
3 What would you advise the Veteran or service member to do next with the information they’ve gathered at this site?

IF they haven’t chosen a program yet, I tell them to look at our catalog, the university websites, to see how long their program is going to be, to see how much remaining entitlement that they have, if they can map out how much of the program the GI Bill will cover.

With the new STEM scholarship, that will be worked into eh conversation, handoff to the academics advisor, then they take e

14. What other questions do you have for me about what we’ve looked at and discussed today?

Programs should be listed
Can students request a new program? That would be awesome

They never know to check WEAMS, they don’t get to our office until they have a bill due, they don’t know that the program is not eleibilbe for benefits until it’s too late. 

Too late, in terms of Vet Tuition isn’t going to paid, but we have a Fin Aid package so we can support them with other Vet specific scholarships, that can put a Vet approved, if their program is not approved

If they can see the approved programs, 
* Drive them to call the school - get the program approved
* Request program approval, send message to the SCO - your program must be approved to receive benefits, show it’s not on a list would go a long way.

**Framing and background**

(Approx. 15 minutes)
We’re going to be talking primarily about behaviors and tools you may have used related to helping Veterans pursue their educational goals. We want to get a sense of the entire way you manage the process, so some of the answers you share may be based on your memory of what you’ve done in the past, and some of the answers might be based on what you might do in the future.

After about 15 minutes of chatting or so, we’ll switch over the the web, and I’m going to ask you to show me some of the things you may have remembered doing, or things you think you’d do to do this kind of work.

Any questions before we get started?

1. Tell me about your work at [Institution name]
Very short time, June 10th. Prior to this, worked at UMUC for 6 years, as a certification specialist, very familiar working with these websites, on the front line staff, supporting the SCOs at that time. With Certs, not submitting, answering all phone calls for VA benefits only, stateside, Europe and and Asia. 
2. Roughly how many Veterans or service members to you or your team work with each term or semester?
Quite a bit, I’m not sure if you’re familiar, UMUC, now UMGC, the school is primarily an online school, hybrid courses, 90K students, the school is geared more towards Veteran students, thats how it started. We had our own dept. just for VA benefits, with about 10 COs there. It was a very big process, for certs, definitely on a yearly basis, deal with 1000s of Vets/AD service. 
3. Talk me through the process of helping a Veteran plan their education here, at a high level. Let’s make sure we note any specific touchpoint you may have with the VA.
 It’s easier to talk about both, I’m kind of getting the hang  of UMBC, a more traditional school. A lot of students, they are younger, they are dependents using parents VA benefits, but also parents come to me and ask questions. They like to come in and person just meet with someone face to face. That seems to be import. Over at UMUC, I didn’t have face to face. 
The main thing I do wanna bring up, I always found myself telling students that “hey have you applied for VA benefits through the VA first?” 
At UMBC young students don’t know that they nee dot go through the process of applying for benefit first. I’m always, I like to use that as a resource, that’s a good start. The best starting point, have you applied for VA benefits, go the VA website. I go to the website often, it’s just been redone, I try to keep myself updated with it on changes that the VA makes, walk them through the process accurately. 
* “Have you obtained your COE?”
	* Often they don’t know what it is. How to get it, where to find it. 
* Basically we have a Vets email account set up, they are supposed to send it to that email, they have it set up to send directly to me, I’m more than happy, when I tell students, send it directly to my email. 
5. What are some of the most common or difficult challenges you encounter during the _school_ application process for a Veteran?
I recently started this position in June, the VA application here is a paper application, (PDF online) a docusigned two page document, first page asks necessary informations for SCSs to process, 2nd page is for them to sign. They always miss that they are supposed to sign, acknowledged all the VAs rules. 
I just redid the application, so I could help process the claim. There was a Chap 34 benefit, since that no longer exists, I’ve consolidated the form, made fields for students to provide their email address, reasons for …, online or face to face, help me process, and help the student, so they can be better served. 
This is a UMBC school side form for VA benefits. School form -  semester certification request form - our process, so we are aware of the student using benefits. 
At UMUC, it was online/embedded into people soft, the students would go through the answers and hit submit, and it would get filtered into the PSoft, we want to get back to that in Sprint 2020. 
6. What are some of the most common or difficult challenges you encounter during the _benefit_ application process for a Veteran?
* Reminding younger students (beneficiaries) to apply first. 
The main hiccup they get, I try to go through the steps with them if I have the time, and they get stuck, one of the things some parents are worried about is there a place for us to put the direct deposit information, book allowance, housing allowance, can I put my own information there so that the student doesn’t get it? 
Some students get a little bit lost, they want to make sure they are filing the application as a dependent, the form dynamically changes, based on how they answer the questions. 
7. What are the most common questions you get from Veterans and service members?
* UMUC - housing allowance. How does the VA see me as full time? Discussed rate of “pursuit?” Let them know how we considered them full time. 
* How do I get started with VA Benefits? If they have no prior knowledge on how to get started. What do I need to do, what documents do I need to send in to the school, unformtately they don’t seem to be aware that they don’t need to do things with the VA.
This is for everyone. 
VA website. Love the website, send them there. Get their information, fill out the application there. 
* They also ask for (relying on housing allowances more, more adults) how to maximize it, also ask for DOLLAR amounts, specific amounts. I never gave them exact dollar amounts, we aren’t allowed to disclose that info to students. I would say to students, this kind of thing is paid out directly from VA to you, the VA are the best people to give you the exact amount. Specific calculations we run, we don’t want to give misinformation. Policy: don’t provide specific dollar amounts. 
8. What are the most challenging questions you get?
9. What kinds of concerns or complaints to you hear related to administering their benefits from the VA?
Mainly they try to get in contact with the VA, some students get frustrated with the wait time, they say it’s difficult to contact the VA. 
Also delay of payments. 
Naturally what I tell students now, I say the sooner you request benefits, get the classes you want, then send your request as soon as possible. Complete the school application and the VA application right away. Then I can get you certified right away, so there’s no delay in your payments, to mitigate that on the school end. 
10. How do you feel about online Veteran feedback about your school?
(If necessary: some school information sites (niche.com for example) display student feedback. Veterans we have talked to say this is an important part of their research and decisions making. Does your school pay attention to user feedback online?) Obviously I didn’t know it was out there, I ‘m not surprised, I think it’s great, students can share their feedback. I think feedback is important for everyone, so we can make things better. I’m always open to that. If there’s anything we need to on the schools end to improve, there always is. We need to be aware. I would like to know from students directly if they can provide feedback. Students share feedback openly with us/me, if they have concerns or complaints, I would address that however I can. Not sites that I track, I don’t have the time to go do that. 
10. What sites do you look to as the authoritative sites on school information?
I wouldn’t give any third party website, I would say go to the .edu website of our school, go to the .edu of their school, look at the info, compare, whoever is more suitable for your pursuits, go there. We don’t use ratings websites. 
11. Do you check websites like online portals to update or verify information posted about your school? Do you send or share information about your school with other sites organizations?
Not that I’m aware of, and I don’t do that. I rely on the VA website/news, emails notifications, having gone through the VA training, I don’t deviate. 
(Transition to observed usage of the web, approx. 30 min)

12. Let’s say you’re ready to help a Veteran do some research online regarding their education. What would you do?

(Observe and note usage up to three websites, note searches, paths, and clicked items)

* registrar.umbc.edu
* Forms
* Veterans Benefits Forms (We changed this, used to say Veterans Affairs Forms so that there was no confusion)
* Semester Serticiation Request and Responsibility Checklist
	* (Procedure, Purpose)
	* Do this once per semester - I always say this to students, continue to say this here, 
	* When I speak with students when they ask “what do I need to do,” I say “Please remember you need to complete this every semester. Spring summer fall, register for classes step 1, complete the form step 2.” 
* Workflow for this form
	* We receive it
	* Transpose it into a database where we have our records where we keep the students information, equivalent of PSoft
	* A Scan it myself save it to Box drive or B Student helpers scan it in
	* Start certifying
	* If students email the form directly, make sure to send them a message confirming receipt
		* (I send a lot of comms to students as a Certifying Official, they leave information out, or check something that isn’t clear, for those instances, I reach out to students to clarify)

For each website used (Up to three that are not  [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) ):

Website 1:

1 Tell me what you found appealing about that website.
2 Do you feel like it answered common questions or would be helpful in planning? 
3 (If not found via Google, and not a first time visit) Where did you first hear about this website?
4 What would you advise the Veteran or service member to do next with the information they’ve gathered at this site?

13. (If they don’t use  [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) ) Let’s take a look at the Veteran’s Affairs website, and see what’s available here to help Veteran’s in planning and meeting their educational goals.
 (Observe and note searches, paths, and clicked items)

Student was curious about housing allowance. 

* When I was at UMUC, the first thing I do Apply for Education Benefits
* I know that the VA had a calculator to calculate out the housing allwoance cost
* When I was at UMUC, I was told it wasn’t entirely accurate, so at UMUC, we shared that information on the VA website, but we also just gave them the number the 455 number for students to call the VA. 
	* Housing allowance is a serious topic, but it didn’t give students the certainty/satisfaciton they needed for their answers. They wanted someone to talk about that. 
	* I am not aware, I’m sure there is information here, I don’t actually know.
* Aware of the GI Bill Comparison Tool (Didn’t click on it)
	* Great tool to compare schools for VA Benefits
“ We didn’t get questions where students were comparing us to other schools.” 
* I would go to rate tables “Benefit rates”
* Can’t find the housing allowance, (Didn’t realize housing allowance was part of the GI Bill) would refer them to the VA
* (I TOOK HIM TO THE COMPARISON TOOL) 
* Searched University of Maryland Baltimore County ( O results) 
* Searched UMBC
* Clicked on UMBC Training Centers not the right information
* University of Maryland - Baltimore County (Needed the dash) 
* This is our populations 400 roughly 
* Yellow Ribbon isn’t common at UMBC, and UMUC we had a lot

Is this helpful? 

I didn’t know the GI Comparison tool gave this much information, never had the time to go and look personally, this is a great resource for students. 

Tell me what you found appealing about  [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) .
1 Do you feel like it answered common questions or would be helpful in educational planning? How?
2 Have you used this website before for this purpose? Where did you first hear about this website?
3 What would you advise the Veteran or service member to do next with the information they’ve gathered at this site?

14. What other questions do you have for me about what we’ve looked at and discussed today?

I was very surprised that the comparison tool gives this much information.

Its awesome that it’s accurate that we can give this to students. 

It would be fantastic if we could go to a website to certify a students, all SCOs need to do this, we have to input some of the information the form, personal information related to the student, chapter of benefits, etc. on the bio screen. If there’s some kind of step, some page, that I can go to see the Veteran status of students on the website, that would be fantastic, I’m all for that.

**Framing and background**

(Approx. 15 minutes)
We’re going to be talking primarily about behaviors and tools you may have used related to helping Veterans pursue their educational goals. We want to get a sense of the entire way you manage the process, so some of the answers you share may be based on your memory of what you’ve done in the past, and some of the answers might be based on what you might do in the future.

After about 15 minutes of chatting or so, we’ll switch over the the web, and I’m going to ask you to show me some of the things you may have remembered doing, or things you think you’d do to do this kind of work.

Any questions before we get started?

1. Tell me about your work at [Institution name]
I’ve been a staff member 3.5 years, worked in this office as a VA work study, during undergrad, here at GW as student and staff. Trasnferred entitlement, 
2. Roughly how many Veterans or service members to you or your team work with each term or semester?
Holistically, total military affiliated, dependents, 1800. Vet activi duty, reservist 2/3, 1200 students. Every semester, we certify 1000 to 1100 using GI Bill Benefits, not costing those using TA. 
3. Talk me through the process of helping a Veteran plan their education here, at a high level. Let’s make sure we note any specific touchpoint you may have with the VA.
* Identying students before hand, capture them once they’ve been applied and admitted, which ones have self identified so we proactively reach out
	* Welcome letter template, who our office is, and how to get started - email
	* Our admitted student checklist is one of the main points, how to contact us at the VA, how to apply, how to request a COE, what we need to process and certify their benefits. 
* Once we have the digital contact info, add them to weekly newsletter dogtags, reminders, posting about events around, at GW in DC in the Veteran community, internship and job postings
	* Using Emma
* Sometimes it varies, in the welcome letter, we list our orientations for incoming students, dates and times, sometimes students come to the orientation and ask questions then, sometimes they drop by. The office to ask questions. Sometimes they are on a school tour, varies by case when they reach out to us next. Based on the student, how knowledgable the are. We’ve used a lot of transfer students, understand the basics, 
* GW: We do require proof of benefits, COE for Yellow Ribbon
* Once we have a recent proof, they have to request Cert every semester, online form, takes a minute to fill out, part of the portal (Request for Certification) 
	* Demographic information
	* Military branch
	* Chapter of benefit
* Consent to submit enrollment verification
* We rely on students to tell us when they want to use their benefits
* Every night, the database send s an email with new requests
* Integrate those into a spreadsheet for the semester
* Confirm documentation for each person, SSN, COE, if anything is missing, we put them on a separate list, if everything is on file they go on the certification list: two steps
	* 0 cert submission phase, enrollment, credits, dates, leave the tuition at 0
	* After add drop, submit tuition fees, if nothings changed, with Add Drop, we just add the tuition. If somethings changed, we finalized the tuition. 
	* VA recommended process
* We administer the payments once they arrive
	* We work with the student accounts office, put them on the appropriate account, Yello Ribbon fund, etc, send them out to the appropriate folks, etc. 
* We also run regular reports to see if they’ve added or dropped classes, they have a very forgiving withdrawal policy, to make sure we are up to date
* One of the things we do that’s now mandated, protect students from late charges and fees while we are waiting for benefit, waived from late fees, finance charges, registration holds, etc. 
	* GW knows that funds aren’t going to arrive by the first day of class, penalized for funds that they aren’t responsible for
* We have to report academic progress, if the student isn’t doing great, that’s part of the SCO process, at the end of the semester only. 
Not ongoing? 
No, once a semester. Student’s previous performance, determines their current status for the next semester. 
4. What are some of the most common or difficult challenges you encounter during the _school_ application process for a Veteran?
* We don’t have any like special admittance procedures for military groups, each school has their own admissions policies and procedures, sometime they will waive the deposit for military students on request, but we don’t get a lot of admissions questions. GW is good about publicizing deadlines. 
* Students ask “ I haven’t been to college, I’ve been serving will that reflect poorly?” The answer is no. Experience is judged the same as coming from a traditional. 
5. What are some of the most common or difficult challenges you encounter during the _benefit_ application process for a Veteran?
* Getting the initial application approved for new students, the VA website advertises a 30 day turnaround, it’s 30 business days if not longer, not calendar days. If they aren’t proactive, don’t have the COE on time, can’t get their benefits right away. Because we do the 0 cert, it kickstarts that housing and book cert. 
* Military population they move a lot, it’s still physical mail that can be a problem. You **DIGITAL COE** might not have the most up to date address. A digital COE would facilitate things a lot faster. Use that as general VA criticism. 
6. What are the most common questions you get from Veterans and service members?
* Yellow Ribbon - GW is expensive, we have a generous YR program, we have matched 24K for undergrads, 48K on top of their base benefit. We make those caps high so that they can afford to go year around. Makes us attractive, so they have questions
* Ami elebilhe? How do Improve that? 
7. What are the most challenging questions you get?
8. What kinds of concerns or complaints to you hear related to administering their benefits from the VA?
* 30 days actually is 30 bus days or longer
* Complaints around the call center
	* Sometimes for example until very recently, the VA doesn’t require that schools have a COE, but as a school WE have that policy, so that we get it right. Students might get upset because the VA doesn’t have this policy when the school DOES have this policy. Not in a malicious way or anything, will give out information, say well your SCO needs to XYZ, without understanding the SCO’s situation. “This is our policy” 
* For graduate students we have to report the full time modifier, I have to turn around and tell the VA what IS full time, 6 credits can’t be full time graduate, 9 credits or more. 
9. How do you feel about online Veteran feedback about your school?
(If necessary: some school information sites (niche.com for example) display student feedback. Veterans we have talked to say this is an important part of their research and decisions making. Does your school pay attention to user feedback online?)
Principles of Excellence, etc. 
It’s good that they provide a way to provide feedback. It can be one sided, we at the school don’t have the opportunity to rebut or demonstrate a resolution, it just stays as a complaint on the website forever, there’s no phase out system. They can see it was submitted years ago, and a lot of times, it’s out of our hands, it’s a complaint about a course, something we have no control over. We might not be able to resolve every issue, or have it fall of the site. 
10. What sites do you look to as the authoritative sites on school information?
.edu
Not usually no. The questions that come to us are school specific, etc. GW internal issues, we do have a Vet Success on campus counselor, we refer stutdnts to  her to help with VA issues. 
11. Do you check websites like online portals to update or verify information posted about your school? Do you send or share information about your school with other sites organizations?
We do participate in 
Best for Vets
Military Times 
Surveys
Their names are similar, those names might not be exactly right. 
(Transition to observed usage of the web, approx. 30 min)

12. Let’s say you’re ready to help a Veteran do some research online regarding their education. What would you do?

(Observe and note usage up to three websites, note searches, paths, and clicked items)

* Email notification principles of excellence of complaint, haven’t gotten one in a while
* Look up the student in the database, we are a banner school, look up their information, take into the context of the complaint, reaching out to financial aide, getc. - get the full picture of the complaint. Reach out to the student, work with the student and the appropriate offices via resolution. 
* Principles of Excellence website
* GI Bill Comparison Tool
* Enter School name
* Result was successful
* Scroll down on profile
* 10 student complaints, 
* Here are the complaints, can I click on the link? 
* Clicked on “STUDENT COMPLAINTS” 
* Doesn’t look like we can access it for them, not entirely sure where I would go to be honest

What do they ask about the most? 

* Yello Ribbon - 3 different caps based on degree level, we have more graduate students, 2/3 graduate, we don’t have a cap on the number of students, 
* A lot of financial based, they want to make sure they can afford, 
	* We usually use 2 years as a base window, because after that it gets a little too loose and unpredictable, e.g. calculate entitlement time, how much do they have left, if any, etc. 
	* We have to process everything by saying this is an estimate, we work two years in advance
	* We ask for a new COE every two years so we have semi recent information 
* Housing allowance
	* Especially for undergrads, but grads also for different reasons
		* Undergrads: room and board fees
		* Grads: with families, what their allowance is to budget for rent
	* Nothing else from a student perspective. 

For each website used (Up to three that are not  [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) ):

14. What other questions do you have for me about what we’ve looked at and discussed today?

One thing that popped into my head, the digital COE thing, one thing I know the VA has been working on is allowing schools to see a students entitlement is in VA ONCE, we can only see certain chapters. They have to create an opt out system where students choose to share that with the school. We want to make it easier. It hasn’t been implemented well in VA Once - 

* Colmery related: We want to see active duty status, until 2022, they aren’t eligible for Yellow Ribbon. That’s an issue where students have gotten off of active duty, I need a new COE showing that they are off of active duty. This is an issue if they move, don’t keep the letter, we have to request a new one, it delays the Yellow Ribbon benefit that they need. 



## Session 4: LeNaya Hezel Georgetown
### Introduction
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kevin and I may also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we’re going to talk about how you’ve worked with Veterans to help them learn about benefits they have related to their education, and supported them in making decisions about their educational goals.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet schools’ and Veterans’ needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and our audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. [Once recording],

My screen is now being recorded.

**Framing and background**

(Approx. 15 minutes)
We’re going to be talking primarily about behaviors and tools you may have used related to helping Veterans pursue their educational goals. We want to get a sense of the entire way you manage the process, so some of the answers you share may be based on your memory of what you’ve done in the past, and some of the answers might be based on what you might do in the future.

After about 15 minutes of chatting or so, we’ll switch over the the web, and I’m going to ask you to show me some of the things you may have remembered doing, or things you think you’d do to do this kind of work.

Any questions before we get started?

1. Tell me about your work at [Institution name]
I oversee our services to support prospective students, current students, alumni who identify as military. 
Service members, military, children

9 years exp. 

We look at it from the life cycle of a student
Our Admission teams is awesome in knowing requirements, we often work with requirements that you have to be a part of the military community to answer. 
How do I talk about my experience as a Vet? Is it financially feasible? We work with admissions office to tag team. 
Once admitted providing them a pathway on how to navigate the university, as well as the Depot of VA, branch of service. If they are using benefits through the branch. 
A lot of cases, students claim they don’ need support, but if you ‘ve been out of school for awhile, here are resources on and off campus to help you, help you identify others to help you get connected, on other veteran, etc. 
We do a lot of career services approach, a probably good 40% of our job is explaining how the benefits work, while I and the team members are not SCOs, we support the SCOs in explaining the benefits. Certifying is a full time job, answering all the questions. 
2. Roughly how many Veterans or service members to you or your team work with each term or semester?
Main campus, law, continuing study, etc. military connected students in an academic year. 
Semester - close to 800, 900 at a time. 1200 in a year, about close to 80% are using benefits. 
3. Talk me through the process of helping a Veteran plan their education here, at a high level. Let’s make sure we note any specific touchpoint you may have with the VA.
	1. Two direct pathways that students connect with our office
		1. They google our school name and Veterans, find our website, 
		call or email our office, occasionally we get walk ins, because of the location of our school, majority, 50/50 calling emailing
		2. Student reaches out to admissions, admissions office refers them to us, soft hand off, provide contact information for us, let them know we are a resource. I can’t tell you how many take them up on the offer, but I have seen the email. More often than not, most of our connections, we are the first touchpoint. 
	2. Try to get a sense of their questions. Up front with them, we have oodles of programs, while we may not know the ins and outs of admissions, we answer as many questions in house as we can, or connect them to admissions when we don’t know the answer, or feel like it should come form Admissions. Make sure they get correct information. Benefit related questions, we can answer those. I’m eligible fo this, how much will it get me if I enroll in your degree program? Walk them through how the benefit pays out - we base this on what the student tells, us, what the stuitition rates currently are, students are open to this, that we are giving them a ballpark figure. In that walkthrough, there’s still a delta, we will connect them to resources for internal and external scholarship opportunities. Depending on the program , we connect them to resources external to GU that 
		* Service to school
		* Warrior scholar project
	We don’t want to “guarantee” admissions, we rely on those external services to help prep people for admissions.

We also offer to connect a pros. Student with a current student. It removes us from the process as an administrator of the university. It allows the opportunity for a prospective and current on what it means to attend their institution. Pretty much what it looks like holistically. If they have specific questions about the application process, degree program, because I can’t guarantee the student, we ask the student, we say you can reach ou two them directly, or I will make a connection. Sometimes students prefer to take contacting the person up themselves. If I make a connection though, it’s clear why I am, and we offer them the decision to disclose their military. 

Support or conversations through admissions or denial? 

When a student has not been admitted they sometimes ask for feedback, we have to refer them to the admissions office itself. A case or two where admissions or our office will tag team if they aren’t accepted? 

I thought that my military service would make me a good candidate? We have to work together on communicating where the admissions office was looking for things, the touchpoints for you to build on. 

Once a student has been admitted, yes, we start that phase all the way back in Feb. March. A student has been admitted, Gung ho about getting their benefits to start. We do engage in that capacity, they will reach back out once they’ve been admitted. 

Other thing we launched last academic year, streamlining our questions across our schools about military connected status. Once a student or prospective student starts the application process, they can indicate the military connected process, they will pull a report will they disclosed, an email will be sent to them about the Veteran’s office, giving them contact information. Ironically a lot of folks didn’t email with questions, but they did write being like “this is awesome, knowing we were there to assist with questions.” Once they did get admitted, they know right off the bat where to go. 

That’s been a positive outcome that we’ve noticed, our second year rolling that out. 

1. What are some of the most common or difficult challenges you encounter during the _school_ application process for a Veteran?

* Is the application fee waived? 
* Is our SATs or GREs required if I have X experience? 
* At the undergrad level, I’ve been out of school for X years, are these requirements of feedback from a HS guidance counselor required. Many Vets apply as transfer students
* Do I apply as a first year vs. transfer? 
	* Do you accept military credits? 
	* Students who took classes online institutions
	* My academic record is better than it was originally, CLEP tests (offered through the college board - free for service members to complete, you take a test on a subject, if you decide you want to study, and ace it, it can apply as credit for some schools. Equivalent of AP classes, how there are test scores with that. Take a test, if you do well, the institution could decide to give you credit for that) 
* Admissions is often asking for lists of current students who self identify, if the student doesn’t self identify through admissions or the university, but only self identifies because they are using benefits, I can’t share that information. Times where Admissions, is doing, a military specific admissions event for a program, and they want to have current students attend, and they push out invites, we have to walk a line on how we disclose that because the data doesn’t belong to admissions. 

2. What are some of the most common or difficult challenges you encounter during the _benefit_ application process for a Veteran?

* We have two application routes/process for undergrads. 
	* One of our largest undergrad programs offered through the application track, tuition is different than tuition for other programs. 
	That plus yellow ribbon rates, one program is covered in full, the other process is not covered in full. Having to explain for schools that are not covered in full, this is how scholarships are issued, you may or may not be eligible for scholarships. This has struggled. 
* Why is one area of the institution covered in full and the other one not? 
	* I have to politically market the institution while explaining the difference to prospective students. 
* Do I use post 9/11 vs. Voc Rehab? (Occasionally get others)
	* For Chapter 33 and 31, for undergrads it’s easier to explain the difference, but for grads it’s a lot more nuanced, chap 31 VRe is to get gainful employment, if you already have an undergrad degree, it may take longer to convince them (the VA) you need a Masters Degree at a high costs institution. We want students to make a well informed decision. The timeline is such that the benefits need to be situated before classes start. We are trying to be realistic in terms of the timelines for students to know differences between the two benefits. 
* 1 or two a semester - a student gets a COE saying they are 100% eligible, get enrolled, and then the VA gets updated info from the dept. of defense saying they aren’t 100% eligible. They thought they were getting the benefit, now they aren’t - how will they finance this? In the admission process, when a student is asking questions about cost of tuition, if you did an ROTC scholarship, or loan repayments, etc. the VA needs to know that information in order to accurately assess your eligibility, that can be a game changer in terms of what you receive. Those are the three areas that take a lot of time. 
	* I give the VA the benefit of the doubt, it’s more about the comms between the VA and the DOD, the loan repayment program, the VA has that up to date, but what trips up that process is if the student did ROTC and got a scholarship, the branch of service doesn’t communicate that to the VA, or it’s not accessible, a more thorough investigation happens afterward.
	* The other case that happens from time to time, when the service member was in the reserves, what’s the VA originally tracking, eligible time to accrue towards days of service, the student didn’t assess the days correctly. That’s another area that has come up. It’s a communication piece between the VA and the DOD. 

3. What are the most common questions you get from Veterans and service members?
4. What are the most challenging questions you get?
5. What kinds of concerns or complaints to you hear related to administering their benefits from the VA?
6. How do you feel about online Veteran feedback about your school?
(If necessary: some school information sites (niche.com for example) display student feedback. Veterans we have talked to say this is an important part of their research and decisions making. Does your school pay attention to user feedback online?)
We don’t pay attention, but the way I feel about it, I value feedback so we can enhance and strengthen our services, students have sent us emails, written a call, and we’ll tweak our services to meet that feedback because it’s valid. I don’t want to silence them. I will note that in a lot of cases, the feedback that we get are misaligned expectations, how we balance that in forums, people can complain about the timeliness of being certified, getting information, for GU we are good about that, where I’ve seen, for example on Facebooks Post 9/11 page, reading through eh comments, “Why is the VA taking so long? “ sometimes it’s the students mistake. How do we meaningfully capture feedback from students who went through the process, going through the process from a holistic perspective, where were the gaps, misunderstood expectations, misaligned undertstnaing - we want to do our best job of communicating who’s responsible for each step of the processs. 
10. What sites do you look to as the authoritative sites on school information?
.edu
Two sites
* Columbia Universitys Veteran Transition (something) did in higher education institute interactive map - we have information listed there, undergrad focused. Info that has our Vet office, tuition rates,e tc.
* College Recon - Pulled a lot of the info on their own from public data sources, similar to the GI Bill Comparison tool - they provide us the opportunity make those edits
* DOD, we have an MOU for tuition assistance, for TA decide, we enter in all the information for tuition assistance. 

For both we can make them at any time - I don’t know if it’s live at any time, but it gets updated eventually. E.g. our yellow ribbon rate on VA site was incorrect, took a long time to change it, it’s not one of those processes, it’s pretty quick. 
11. Do you check websites like online portals to update or verify information posted about your school? Do you send or share information about your school with other sites organizations?

(Transition to observed usage of the web, approx. 30 min)

12. Let’s say you’re ready to help a Veteran do some research online regarding their education. What would you do?

(Observe and note usage up to three websites, note searches, paths, and clicked items)

For each website used (Up to three that are not  [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) ):


13. (If they don’t use  [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) ) Let’s take a look at the Veteran’s Affairs website, and see what’s available here to help Veteran’s in planning and meeting their educational goals.
 (Observe and note searches, paths, and clicked items)

Georgetown on CT

Most asked
* Housing allowance rates (Part time vs. full time) 
* In April or May, we are a lot of people finding out they have been admitted to the university at that time, the post 9/11 tuition rate is for the current academic year, doesn’t have info for the upcoming year. How much am I actually getting? 
	* It doesn’t say what academic year this is for. The 24,477 is for 19/20, but students in 20/21 year, this rate is now outddated, 
* The other one we get is Yellow Ribbon - this defaulted to a school that has the higher Yellow Ribbon program rates, our students don’t know the difference between where programs fall under
	* **Usability issue college can’t set default Yellow Ribbon rate**
	* They can accurately pull the correct rate. 
	* There’s a school missing on this page. 
* Scholarship input one is confusing, this is assuming that student puts in a scholarship? 
* That’s pretty much it, 
* Online only is listed as not available for graduate, but actually it is
* Also the VetSuccess on Campus, if that’s VSOC, we are waiting in the queue to get it. 
* Trying to explain this to students
* Luke knows me about the student outcomes, that’s a pain point from a university perspective, this data causing more trouble than it’s worth
* **A student has never asked me about the outcomes, grad rates, ever.** 
* There are orgs. Like **Service to School** on having service members look at that information, I don’t know if CAP just redid the curriculum 

Tell me what you found appealing about  [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) .
1 Do you feel like it answered common questions or would be helpful in educational planning? How?
2 Have you used this website before for this purpose? Where did you first hear about this website?
3 What would you advise the Veteran or service member to do next with the information they’ve gathered at this site?

14. What other questions do you have for me about what we’ve looked at and discussed today?

I think that’s been promised since I was certifying, that’s been promised for awhile, there has been talk that we would be able to see a students eligibility at VA ONCE but that’s assuming a student has been admitted. It gets tricky at what point can schools see that info if they are still a prospective student, vs. a current student. Once a student has been admitted, that would save a lot of time, as long as what we are seeing is LIVE and active, e.g. how many months of eligibility do I have remaining? Is there enough time to get them through the semester or not? 

## Session 5: M. Antoinia Silas UMBC
### Introduction
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kevin and I may also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we’re going to talk about how you’ve worked with Veterans to help them learn about benefits they have related to their education, and supported them in making decisions about their educational goals.

We want to get a sense of the entire way you manage the process, so some of the answers you share may be based on your memory of what you’ve done in the past, and some of the answers might be based on what you might do in the future.

After about 15 minutes of chatting or so, we’ll switch over the the web, and I’m going to ask you to show me some of the things you may have remembered doing, or things you think you’d do to do this kind of work.

Any questions before we get started?

1. Tell me about your work at [Institution name]

Over a year, came in July of last year, was not doing this work before, prior working for Dept of Agriculture, transitioned into Edu role. Always been a supporter of edu, supporting underrepresented populations in edu. 

2. Roughly how many Veterans or service members to you or your team work with each term or semester?

Difficult question to answer 
UMBC utilizes the common app, prominant across a wide variety of schools. Service members affiliation is self reporting, not a requirement that they disclose what branch if any association. After that, there’s one area right there. The differentiation between Vets_dependents_active duty, difficult to discern, the main thing that 

I do have an answer, we have a demotgraphic report for the person of counting Veterans on campus, later in the conversation, I can pull that report up, 

The way in which designations are made to Veteran, dependent, vs. those who are not, or have not, makes it hard to identify. We are very regularly having discussions with admissions as it pertains to more effectively accurate

Last semester it was 280 students, a lot of males, 200 male, 80 were female. However, I do have a report that I have access to, that I can circle back to. The common app and the way the verbage is on the common app, in terms of selections it allows people to make, it’s a barrier, 

3. Talk me through the process of helping a Veteran plan their education here, at a high level. Let’s make sure we note any specific touchpoint you may have with the VA.

Provide clarification - the way things are at UMBC, Veteran support is decentralized, in terms of certifications, I don’t handle that, the registrar handles that. That person, all he does is certification and makes sure Vets receive the benefits. 

My office is program for benefits. I’m working on sending them early communications, places they can find support, how our office is support. 

We have a welcome reception for Veterans. Reach out to campus partners, to have Veteran services, give them perspective on what they can get support from. 

University health services, etc. civic engagement, etc. these are the usual players. 

There are a variety of events, veterans tend to be independent, they enjoy spending time with other Veterans, that’s run by our Veteran student graduate assistant. Former member of the army , he leads that conversation. We have a hail and farewell of stuff for Vets are graduating, Vetereans day, vets recognition at a sporting event. Lunch celebrations, opportunities for Vets to communicate and collaborate. 

My office specifically focuses on programming, we recently started our student Veterans association. Retrieve vets, different people that are recognized, different campus resources, things like that. 

We are also in the process of establishing a Veteran’s lounge on our campus. That has never been a fixture, over the next semester, we will get that space to where it needs to be in terms of making a dedicated space. 

Newer initiatives, only been here for a year. I serve this populations and also commuter students, transfer students and adult learners, all of which 

Veteran faculty and staff group being established. Providing support to Veterans, etc. You can go to one space, get all of these resources. 

Those resources for Vets are growing. 

OCSS - Off Campus Student Services

4. What are some of the most common or difficult challenges you encounter during the _school_ application process for a Veteran?

Admissions and registrar does this, I do retention

5. What are some of the most common or difficult challenges you encounter during the _benefit_ application process for a Veteran?
6. What are the most common questions you get from Veterans and service members?

* A lot of times, it has to deal with their benefits. In the past, this is a process that is being refined technologically. In the past my office has assisted with certification, providing preliminary information the registrar. Now that we are focused on creating community, the registrar handles this information. People will still send me certifications, 
	* Where can I go for assistance with certificaiton?
	* Are there mental health related services I can utilize? 
	* Is there are Veteran space? (That’s coming) 
* most are very independent, I see them at events. They are looking for ways to get engaged on campus, spend time amongst other veterans. Considerations for getting around campus. They may disclose things, challenges they face. 

7. What are the most challenging questions you get?

* Making a transition from armed services, which has very structured/high degree of specificity, versus trantioning to a university environment, doesn’t have that level of rigidity, that service members are familiar with,
* Metnal health concerns
* Financial concerns, benefits aren’t as quick as they could be
* Finding support with Veteran Affairs has been a challenge as well
	* 
* They often disclose those people to our Veteran services graduate assistant. I prefer them to directly work with folks. In many cases they will disclose that to people that are a part of the community. 

8. What kinds of concerns or complaints to you hear related to administering their benefits from the VA?

* I don’t have a high degree of specificity, finding the right individual for what a Veteran is looking for
* Navigating the VA website, getting things to work
* Certification, if something hasn’t shaken out it can be difficult to find the right person. 

9. How do you feel about online Veteran feedback about your school?
(If necessary: some school information sites (niche.com for example) display student feedback. Veterans we have talked to say this is an important part of their research and decisions making. Does your school pay attention to user feedback online?)

Not something that I have searched out. Haven’t come across any sentiments online. I just got here a year ago, the sentiment was that UMBC doesn’t support Veterans well enough, where other places have dedicated centers for Vet support. UMBC doesn’t have anything centralized in that regard, we’ve made a lot of progress, it’s slowly changing. UMBC definitely wants to support Veterans, structurally, it’s decentralized. There’s no clarity in terms of the type of support that Vets can expect to receive. Lack of guidance in terms of structure promoting those services. That’s why I’m re-instating the Veteran group, so that I can confidently link things to the Veterans site. 

They have experience talking to Veterans. 

10. What sites do you look to as the authoritative sites on school information?

UMBC, Veterans.umbc.edu run out of this office. The website is in the process of being updated, a lot fo the initiatives, those are the types of resources specific to campus that I want to list on t eh website, the incoming graduate assistant, he has close ties to the VA, looking to implement more VA related resources. That’s currently what we have, as perspective for how to get the dedicated support here, insuring that Veterans get their benefits. That dictates how they feel about the level support they are receiving here. Making sure it gets done’ in a clean and timely matter. The process is the best it has been regarding the process. VA resources something we just talked about a few days ago, when he gets on board in a week, this will be something we focus on. 

11. Do you check websites like online portals to update or verify information posted about your school? Do you send or share information about your school with other sites organizations?

* External, no. 

(Transition to observed usage of the web, approx. 30 min)

12. Let’s say you’re ready to help a Veteran do some research online regarding their education. What would you do?

Veterans.umbc.edu

Listings for different scholarships and VA programs. Does have some resources, I point them to that as a hub. 

(Observe and note usage up to three websites, note searches, paths, and clicked items)

For each website used (Up to three that are not  [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) ):

Website 1: Veterans.umbc.edu

* Making sure that benefits are taking care of
* They assume we deal with their benefits, we provide this checklist as a way for them to know how the process works at UMBC. A lot of the interactions revolve around this kind of thing
* We have a page linked to edu benefits, websites, yellow ribbon program, etc. 
* Both specific to VA in MD and in general, different scholarships, etc. 
* These are reoccurring scholarships, STEM based scholarships, etc. 
* Guide them to this form, the VA form. We would deliver this form to the SCO. With the high level of detail in these forms, the restraints of the office, we shouldn’t be interacting with this form. Too much PII. Risk for a security breach, etc. 
* Different resources, this is the portion of the website that I want to update, things on campus, 
* Off campus resources that Veterans can make use of

**Note: How well integrated are Veteran student support services with admissions and registrar? A lot of the SCO stuff happens in admissions and registrar, if Vet support isn’t in that office it’s a disconnect. Separation of programming for Vets and administration of benefits.** 

I’m in a group of registrars and other people that work for the benefit of Vets for the state of MD, some schools are structured to ours, some are under one group, some have an SCO in each group. 

One thing I’m hoping we are able to work towards a centralized group, handling both benefits and student life issues.

## Session 6: Andrew Roman Columbia Southern
### Introduction
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kevin and I may also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we’re going to talk about how you’ve worked with Veterans to help them learn about benefits they have related to their education, and supported them in making decisions about their educational goals.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet schools’ and Veterans’ needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and our audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. [Once recording],

My screen is now being recorded.

**Framing and background**

(Approx. 15 minutes)
We’re going to be talking primarily about behaviors and tools you may have used related to helping Veterans pursue their educational goals. We want to get a sense of the entire way you manage the process, so some of the answers you share may be based on your memory of what you’ve done in the past, and some of the answers might be based on what you might do in the future.

After about 15 minutes of chatting or so, we’ll switch over the the web, and I’m going to ask you to show me some of the things you may have remembered doing, or things you think you’d do to do this kind of work.

Any questions before we get started?

1. Tell me about your work at [Institution name]

In Aug. last year, retired from the military. Moved to the coastal Alabama region. Advertising for director of Vet intitaiotnves. Very close to where I move to, interviewed, got the position. 

Starte in October of 2018. They wanted to build a Veterans program from the University. The University has catered to Military to Vets for a numbers of years, but they didn’t have a Vet specific dept, to address student Veteran issues. In January we began operating, doing a number of different things. 

* Veterans initiative operational approach - Links with strat3gic plan to provide outreach to Vets and edu services
* We’re just starting the program, I’ve got a lot fo latitude, all the things that I want to do don’t fit into the amount of time, it’s been very busy. Just returned from an American GI forum event in Las Vegas. Headquarterd in Colorado. A very good event, allowed me to learn a lot about their Vet outreach

What we are trying to do here is 
1. External engagement
2. Inernal engatement

Internally we support all the student Vets that go to the university, administer to our chapter of the Student Veterans fo America. I’m also the Chapter advisor. 

It’s difficult because right now it’s hard to get people to participate. The addition of being an online school is a unique challenge as well; it has some benefits in that our chapter membership isn’t in one physical location, they can reach out to other people across the country, reach out to Vets maybe look for job opporiunityes, other things going on in different parts of the country. 

Just kind of getting started, a lot going on, refining some of our Vet engagement support things as we go. Learning a lot as we go through, that’s basically it to this point. 

2. Roughly how many Veterans or service members to you or your team work with each term or semester?

Approximately 3800 Vets that go to the school right now. 

Directly I work with about, a few dozen, because I’m interacting with them directly. We do reach out individually to some of our student Veterans that are already going to the university, introduce the dept. A lot of times we are just leaving a message, sending an email. I’ve done that for 100s of Vets, attempts. Actually talking to them, it varies, direct engagement with a couple dozen on a continuous basis, of the 3800, some of them probably don’t know about our program yet. It’s a bit difficult to reach out to all fo them. We are going through the list that we have of those that have identified as Vets or we know are based on the benefits they are using. 

In our data systems they didn’t build in a button that would be a Vet. Self identified way of capturing them throughout their time at the U. If they changed a pattern of benefits from GI Bill to something else, ran out of the GI Bill for example, financial aid, exchanged that method, you could lose visibility of that, unless you search through other data sources, eg. COE on file. Working through those identification things so that we can reach out and make sure. 

One example I use at the U. - I have the VP of Student Vets of America, his employer was paying for tuition, and he didnt’ identify himself as a Veteran, yet he was our VP of Student Vets of America, was a Navy Vet, in the area in Mobile Alabama. Our VP of Student Vets chapter wasn’t even identified in our data system. Really had some difficulty in some of the identification mechanisms that we have. We are trying to get that information on the dept. out to as many vets so that they know they can contact us. 

Over the last 6 mos. people are starting to engage us, responding to the announcement infomraiotn mechanisms that we’ve done. I’m getting some of that. We do a comprehensive umbrella. In each dept. registrar, admissions, Fin Aid. Well trained individuals that understand the GI Bill, etc. They do a good job, but finding out who those people are inside of the departments. I can link them up with anyone directly that would best suit what their question is. 

Pre-application students? Prospective students? 

I was doing promotion, a few Vets at a conference, I said OK would you like collateral? Give that out, they give me their name and contact info that I provide to admissions, they know all the technical forms, different options they would have. We give them a brief overview of that. Our dept is just two people, myself and another rep. Was in Memphis last week, doing the same type of outreach. 

It’s a 50/50 thing. I have a Veterans Engagement model, it’s a lot of circles, in the middle is student Vets of America chapter, students at the U. That have shown an interest in being engaged as a Vet. Next outer ring, student Vets that self identify but not part of the chapter. We have the ring of the Vet initiatives dept. Everything internal engagement, on the outside we have Vet alumni, we do engagement with them as well, overall 38% of the students that go here were referred to us by another student. Our student Vet or Vet alumni, may be interested in going to college, other edu opportunities that we can provide them. 

The outer ring is the vets at large, we understand that you can’t; they are spread out all over the US. THere’s no one concentration; we go to conferences to engage them. 

3rd party mechanisms (Vet orgs) build understanding, build partnerships with them. If we can build them out, helps them do the outreach they do, and identify and attact. 

Student Vets of America
American Legion
Smaller Vets org (American GI Forum) 
If we go on the one that deals with Vets Non Commissioned Officers Association
National Vets Wheelchair Games in Louisville, etc. more for brand recognition

Non Commissioned Officers Association already had a connection with eh university. We run across students at every one of these conferences. We can mutually support each other, etc. Opportunity to engage their member ship as whole

3. Talk me through the process of helping a Veteran plan their education here, at a high level. Let’s make sure we note any specific touchpoint you may have with the VA.
4. What are some of the most common or difficult challenges you encounter during the _school_ application process for a Veteran?
5. What are some of the most common or difficult challenges you encounter during the _benefit_ application process for a Veteran?
6. What are the most common questions you get from Veterans and service members?

* Benefits is always the one. Can I use my benefits, what is there when I run out of my benefits. That’s the largest. 
*

7. What are the most challenging questions you get?

 One of the trickiest ones, I was very interested in, I was a retired/active guard reserve for Michigan Army Nat. Guard. We engaged in things with our soldiers on PTSD. One of our disability services, had a PTS trigger based on the course he was in. I was able to present information my background to the small group, that was assembled to deal with the Veterans issue, very refreshing to see the all hands on deck, no defined patterns, difficult to anticipate, other than the Vet. Is put in a very vulnerable situation, they are really looking for help. They were able to help them rapidly so that they could continue their course. Nice to see that in the org. 

8. What kinds of concerns or complaints to you hear related to administering their benefits from the VA?

* This is where when we get into benefits issues, I go upstairs and talk to folks in FIncianial Aid on certain things, they are easy ones, reimbursement for certain items, real easy stuff right now. Not a lot of our student Veterans know about the department yet. Trying to get the word out, things are starting to trickle in now that we’ve been at it for 8 mos. Trying to engage that internal population. Usually our Fin Aid folks, are so well trained int he Benefits, I rarely hear back from them, other than thanks for the help. Don’t get a lot of the feedback on how stuff was resolved. 

9. How do you feel about online Veteran feedback about your school?
(If necessary: some school information sites (niche.com for example) display student feedback. Veterans we have talked to say this is an important part of their research and decisions making. Does your school pay attention to user feedback online?)

I’ve only looked at some of the stuff on our Facebook page. I’d have to get into our marketing dept. on that. I will look at it to see if there’s a Veteran specific issue, 3800 Vets out of 30K students. I don’t have a mechanism for looking at just students Vet issues. I welcome that feedback though. 

I don’t think our school is afraid of any feedback that comes back to us around servicing our student Vet. 

10. What sites do you look to as the authoritative sites on school information?

That’s been a challenge too. Some of these college evaluation sites that you put information into. The ranking of programs that are better for Vets, better for service members. You wonder, are the rankings tied to the amount of sponsorship a school will provide? There are some of those. To distinguish between to the good sites, from sponsor based sites. I don’t know if there’s a good way to distinguish ones based on data, traditional vs. online institiaiotns, etc. how they go through it in terms of the time they use, etc. 

It’s not the coming out of HS and going to school for four years. It’s a little bit, a lot of aldult learners, it affects the way that data is represented/pulled on the site. 

Consistency of information requirements
 
One I tried to work with, which the American Legion has partnered with 
CollegeRecon.com - we don’t have a representation on that site yet. We need to get into their cycle/timing of it. We’d have to subscribe to it to be listed in there. They have a good reputation from the way they present data. They have trust from the legion , that’s one I’ve sat down and talk to the folks there. 

Am Le. Is the largest Vet org out there. They have some quality initiatives when it comes to edu of Vets. They were that I’m still interested in working with. 

I scan through others, sometimes you are listed high on one site, on others you might not even be on the list. It’s not clear how we are listed, other than sponsoring the website to give them revenue. If there was, I tell ya, like the Honest Broker site, this is where the fact checker for Vets out there, we would do well in that environment. I’d like to see something like that. 

11. Do you check websites like online portals to update or verify information posted about your school? Do you send or share information about your school with other sites organizations?

(Transition to observed usage of the web, approx. 30 min)

12. Let’s say you’re ready to help a Veteran do some research online regarding their education. What would you do?

(Observe and note usage up to three websites, note searches, paths, and clicked items)

For each website used (Up to three that are not  [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) ):

Website 1: CollegeRecon.com 

1 Tell me what you found appealing about that website.
2 Do you feel like it answered common questions or would be helpful in planning? 
3 (If not found via Google, and not a first time visit) Where did you first hear about this website?
4 What would you advise the Veteran or service member to do next with the information they’ve gathered at this site?

Basic Allowance for Housing, BAH


How do they do the ranking? 
Is it based more on sponsorship? 
Or is based on college rankings by actual data? A mechanism USNews to base how they rate on there

CollegeFactual.com - online site

I have yet to come across Veterans that I’ve engaged, there was only one person that was aware of Columbia Southern U., the first question I get is “where’s that,” or they look around and see what information you have. Some people, because we don’t have a large national marketing campaign, it’s based on that individual engagement, we are just starting with the Vet’s program. 

One conference that I was just at, next week is the national association of state directors of Vet Affairs, we went to their midwinter conf. In Feb in Alexandria. We got invited to listen to Secretary Wilke speak. That’s more of the brand recognition type thing. 

Next week AmVets in Louisville
Am. Legion in Indianapolis after that, to get the name out with the Vet. Populations. 


13. (If they don’t use  [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) ) Let’s take a look at the Veteran’s Affairs website, and see what’s available here to help Veteran’s in planning and meeting their educational goals.

1 Do you feel like it answered common questions or would be helpful in educational planning? How?
2 Have you used this website before for this purpose? Where did you first hear about this website?
3 What would you advise the Veteran or service member to do next with the information they’ve gathered at this site?

14. What other questions do you have for me about what we’ve looked at and discussed today?

Vets have seen the trend of these site tending towards sponsorship, they were looking at developing some of these mechnams

There’s a program of the Veterans’ Educational Project, sub element of that organization. They are doing the same thing, which involved on site visits for information and vetting. 

The best thing that we can do is get them that kind of information, have a trusted source of information so that when they are making their educational decisions, they aren’t guessing. 

Our focus is to provide an edu opportunity that fits what they need. If it doesn’t, we will try to advise them to one that may better fit their need. 

We don’t want them to attend the U if it isn’t going to benefit them. 

A large chunk of our students are based on referrals from other students. The word of mouth is our biggest asset when it comes to identifying new students and edu opportunities. We want to help the Vet, if they are served better by something else, we want them to go somewhere else. 

You don’t get a refund on the GI Bill - when you use it, it’s gone. We want them to come out on the other side with the edu product they need to do what they want to do in life. 

If there was any way to develop an internal university referral mechanism for Vets. We do that when we know of other universities, that conference was in Vegas, I know that U of Nv Las Vegas, Texas A and M is amazing, it’s one of those ones, if someone fits; if they are in that area, by all means.
