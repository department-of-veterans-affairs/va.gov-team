# Session 1: Jose
(Approx. 3 minutes)
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kevin and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we’re going to talk about how you’ve worked with Veterans to help them learn about benefits they have related to their education, and made decisions about their educational goals.
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
* This entire session should take about 50 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran’s needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and our audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. [Once recording],
My screen is now being recorded.
### Framing and background
(Approx. 20 minutes)
We’re going to be talking primarily about behaviors and tools you may have used related to pursuing your educational goals. Because we’re talking to Veterans and active duty service members that are at different points in pursuing their educational goals, some of the answers you share may be based on your memory of what you’ve done in the past, and some of the answers might be based on what you might do in the future.
After about 15 minutes of chatting or so, we’ll switch over the the web, and I’m going to ask you to show me some of the things you may have remembered doing, or things you think you’d do to do this kind of planning.
Any questions before we get started?
1. Tell me about your military service.
	* (If active duty) What is your planned transition date to civilian status?
	* (If Veteran) When did you transition to civilian status?
		* 4 years active, 4 years in active reserve
		* 4 years since
		* 4 years since I’ve been civilian side, went in 2011, got out a month early
	2. Have you thought about taking advantage of the educational benefits provided by the Veterans Affairs administration?
Yes
	* (If active duty) Are you planning on taking advantage of these benefits before you transition to civilian status?
3. (If yes) What benefits are you thinking about taking advantage of?
Right now, doing the college, did college for a little bit at Penn State York. Started taking online courses with Southern University, It’s better, everything else is on my time, I can knock out a lecture for the week. I can see everything that’s done on my time. For college. If college weren’t in the works, I would have done the Vocational Rehab or the CDL course. 

Schedule is the primary difference.

Since I was in college right out of the Marines, I just wanted to go to the gym and go to work, then I switched from full time to part time, working full time hours I was working my regular job. Working and attending school. Did both sides. I wasn’t focused enough either, 

Attending school and working. 

Full time school, working second third shift, at work or at school, not focusing. 

Now I can get home from work, take a nap, go to they gym, and do my homework. 

4. Where did you first learn about educational benefits?
Right before we transitioned out, we had all the transitions classes, it’s called STEPS and TAPS. 
	* (If Veteran) Did you attend the TAP program? 
1. (If yes) When? What do you remember about that program?
It was pretty much like, felt like you weren’t in the military anymore, it was the light at the end of the tunnel, but then you had to worry about school, budgeting your money, had a different sense of something else, you knew your schedule every day before it happened. You had to worry about being a normal civilian all over again. 

What do you remember? 
I don’t really remember exactly, the teachers were like you want to find a profession that you like, you want to go to school again, unless you go into a factory worker, you should go to school, unless you liked hands on work. Whatever you give is what you get back. If you give 100%, you get 100% back. I’m going to grad. In 3 years because I’m taking classes non stop. 

	* (If active duty) Are you familiar with the TAP program? 1. (If yes) Tell me what you’ve learned about the TAP program.
5. What are your goals related to your education? What kind of career are you pursuing?

Always interested computer repair, went for in high school, the repair aspect is phasing out, easier to buy, more cyber security, or just like networking to a degree. Still figuring out the job, depends on whose hiring which companies. 
Degree in 3 years, B.S. in Computer Science 

6. What are some of the specific things that you think about as you evaluate different educational options? 

* Coming out of the Marine corps with disability rating
* Using that as paycheck while I went to school, I was either go to college or go work full time, I like to work
* I didn’t have much of a plan
* I would say it was just, going to school, I was used to waking up early, I had to study, that’s pretty much it, figuring out what worked best for me to study, what jobs were available to bring in extra money on the side

What makes one option more appealing to you, vs. another?

Penn Foster Career School
1.	Tell me what you found appealing about that website. C
Career Diploma
2.	Do you feel like it answered your questions or helped you in your planning? 
Glancing over, available 24/7, work when you want, connect you with other students, if you have a question, you can ask each other for yelp, you learn at your own pace
3.	(If not found via Google, and not a first time visit) Where did you first hear about this website? 
No.

Looked for a moderator, they are “important people that have a lot of knowledge” 
Tells you the A+ Certificaiton, that’s what I would need
Basic knowledge


1.	Tell me what you found appealing about that website. 
Looking at it you can see how many people have commented on something. You can see kind of like the rank on the site after awhile, they give rankings, how they help people out - people who give good advice, as you can see July 9 2012, 

Everyone can find the answers, but if you can’t build a computer or break it you shouldn’t be int the field. This confirms I can pass my A+ certification.
2.	Do you feel like it answered your questions or helped you in your planning? 
3.	(If not found via Google, and not a first time visit) Where did you first hear about this website? 
Used this website in HS to find answers to computer repair questions, and also when I had to build my first computer as a graduation project, I posted I have 500, what are good parts on a budget, they told me why I should pick a part.

Haven’t been here before
4.	What would you do next with the information you’ve gathered at this site? 

Microsoft IT Academy Website
It was gone
I would google certificates in this or degrees in this, so the basics, server services, etc. 

Google names of courses? 

I would go back to Penn Foster, or the other college, and see what their IT classes compare what they offer to that list. 

8. (If they don’t use VA.gov) Let’s take a look at the Veteran’s Affairs website, and see what’s available here to help you in planning and meeting your educational goals.
(Observe)

* Education and Training 
* Noticed benefits started, and phone numbers
* GI Bill Comparison Tool (link lower on page) 
	* I know you have post 911/montgmery benefit - there’s just slim differences in them, steps and taps

* York College of PA
		* Wanted to see how much would come out of my pocket
		* How much the school 
		* Says out of pocket tuition 0 dollars
	* I would see if I could contact the school directly, or go to the school and ask them more questions

GI Bill, and looking traction Voc Rehab

Post 9/11
4.	Where did you first learn about educational benefits?
Some college active duty, they used to call it tuition assistance, never completed, got out, didn’t know I qualified as a Vet until I went back to school again, in psychology. Talked about some trauma in active duty, she got me to the VA. It was very interesting. I don’t remember how I got back into school, but I know that I used the GI Bill, I didn’t connect the two, seeking Medical Care, started that in 2010, that was a rough road. Didn’t fail out, ended up getting a divorce, moving across the country, starting going back to school 2.5 years ago, transferred some credits, that’s why I’m looking at my senior year, lots of credits transferred, did some classes over in MD. 
	  1.	(If Veteran) Did you attend the TAP program? 
Yes. 

	      1.	(If yes) When? What do you remember about that program?

2.5 months GI 
BSW - would like to, I don’t know the details, I would like fo them to help me through my Masters. 

6.	What are some of the specific things that you think about as you evaluate different educational options? What makes one option more appealing to you, vs. another? 

Always super personal, where I was in my life, having kids, separating, starting a new life with a new person, believing in my self. Therapy is a huge one, the right team of people to support me, all around the whole health model wise, that’s what kept me going. Never in my wildest dreams even though I would have gotten an associates, it’s an acumliation of a big team of people that have gotten. 

I would say it’s a mix between my coworkers, and my husband and the school itself. Everyone

7.	Let’s say your ready to do some research online regarding your education. What would you do? 
(Observe)

For each website used (Up to three that are not VA.gov):

* Search MSW Online Programs
* I would click on the first one Fordham, I’ve already researched it I know I want to go there, they offer 8 most program, over a 12 to 16 mos masters, that’ instantly caught my eye
* 

	1.	Tell me what you found appealing about that website. 
* The thing I liked bout tit he most, gave me the whole curriculum, gave me the option of how to get in th e 8 mon program, for my practicum, I have a lot anxiety over that. Told me what my expectations were. Called them

Asked if they allowed a work study, they did talk about work study, but I didn’t know thats’ what it meant, where I can stay I’m at work and do my practicum while I’m at work

I don’t like wasting time, I know where my focus is and I want to stay with Veterans, they supported it. 

I think it’s more general, I have anxiety over most anything, a practicum this is 8 most, 6 most of the program where I’m going to be working with another org. Makes me nervous that I don’t know the people, don’t know the coworkers, that really raises anxiety, I have to prepare for everything, in my search, I’m focusing on where I want to be year from now, I need to know way ahead of time. 
	2.	Do you feel like it answered your questions or helped you in your planning? 
	3.	(If not found via Bing, and not a first time visit) Where did you first hear about this website? 

Can’t be fore certain, Google or Bing at work.
	4.	What would you do next with the information you’ve gathered at this site? 

Asked if they supported GI Bill Voc Rehab, me figuring out how I would apply for Voc Rehab

I would search
VA Vocational Rehab Program
I would run down the side menu, Voc Rehab Vet. Employment Tracks
* It sounds like Voc Rehab Veteran, it’s going to tell me a story, what tracks or options 

How to Apply
eBenefits (steps) 
When I did it, eBenefits wasn’t allowing me to apply to through it, called our Voc Rehab here, it’s happening through a lot of people, they said to come int and do it by hand, and we’ll fax it, the Spokane VA, happened to a few other people. 

Referring everyone to eBenefits, it wasn’t populating, VA was saying something wrong with E Benefits. 



8.	(If they don’t use VA.gov) Let’s take a look at the Veteran’s Affairs website, and see what’s available here to help you in planning and meeting your educational goals. 

	(Observe)
Bing, 
Not top result. 
I want to say I would Apply to see what it says, I click on everything, I’m a bad clicker
I want to go here to see there’s a different offering for other kind of benefits
Go to apply
Go to ebenefits

Looked on comparison 
Not clear if it’s a post 911 Gi Bnefit, or another benefit, voc rehab

	1.	Tell me what you found appealing about VA.gov. 
	2.	Do you feel like it answered your questions or helped you in your planning? How? 
	3.	Have you used this website before for this purpose? Where did you first hear about this website? 
	4.	What would you do next with the information you’ve gathered at this site? 

9.	What other questions do you have for me about what we’ve looked at and discussed today? 

No questions. This is pretty cool, because I didn’t jump on this specific website, I showed you how I did it - it’s neat that this is here for us.

Any questions before we get started? 


1.	Tell me about your military service.
	1982 in HS, commissioned through the MEsap program, finished my undergrad, retired in 2006. Did MOI duty at Duke and UNC Chapel Hill, both while 15 years as an officer. 24 years total. Took advantage of Edu benefits at every turn. 	
  1.	(If active duty) What is your planned transition date to civilian status? 
	
	  2.	(If Veteran) When did you transition to civilian status? 
	2006, summer
2.	Have you thought about taking advantage of the educational benefits provided by the Veterans Affairs administration? 
	* Enlisted used VEAP - boot camp, 300 a month, until I reached 2700 dollars,  during the early 80s, they gave you an opportunity to join it at Boot camp and one other time. Took money from your paycheck, up to 2700, and when you enrolled you were paid 3 times that. Maxed it out, payed back 8100. 
	Undgreatd Miami of Ohio, BA Polictal Science
	* Undergrad applied to get the money, got 8100 dollars back on that investment
	* Not sure if it falls under VA, Marine Offier Instructor, they had the resistance… not still available,… a fund you can pull for if you are registered for school, they would pay up to 80% of your tuition. Marine Assistance Program
	* M International Relations NC State, Raliegh - 2003
	Because I qualified with the post 911 bill, at the Tap course, I remember asking about it, I was told you could transfer it to your children, and I asked them if there were any restrictions, after I was retired, was told that you had to do it while in uniform. That’s not made clear during the TAP program. I told everybody what happened to me. 
	  1.	(If active duty) Are you planning on taking advantage of these benefits before you transition to civilian status? 
3.	(If yes) What benefits are you thinking about taking advantage of? 
4.	Where did you first learn about educational benefits?
	VEAP during Boot Camp, 
	Tried to have, my first duty station was at Marine Barracks in DC, officers would give us annually the edu benefits were available, and we were stupid not to use them. I did the same thing once I become the officer. The most important time was in Boot camp, here’s the program you have, sign up now or it will pass you. I was like, done, I signed the paperwork and got into. it. 
In my first couple years it was part of my annual training, got the class every year, I had already signed up for it and I sat listened. I remember it being pushed, and thinking I’m one of the good guys, it needs to get pushed at that level, and people don’t know that they can take advantage of it. 
	  1.	(If Veteran) Did you attend the TAP program? 
	Yes
	      1.	(If yes) When? What do you remember about that program? 
	2006, May. I remember them stressing that you need to pay attention and you need to reach out to your VA source when you retire. I thought I understood it, I don’t remember getting a handout, my wife would have read it too and caught my mistake. Maybe 30 minutes of the 2 days that they discussed education. As I recall, as I look back, I wish would have paid close attention. There was a 2 hour block about VA, and education was a piece of it. I don’t remember it being a big part of it. 
	  2.	(If active duty) Are you familiar with the TAP program? 
	    1.	(If yes) Tell me what you’ve learned about the TAP program.
5.	What are your goals related to your education? What kind of career are you pursuing? 

Basically a job in International Relations, leverage world travel, working with other countries, diplomatics role. Well, I passed the Foreign service officer exam that year, and after the the mortgage and family, I needed to stay employed, I didn’t pursue it exactly as I planned. When your daughter is in high school. 

Got me to other opportunities? 

Absolutely, the best way to explain it is that I had a horrible guidance counselor in HS. When I enlisted in late entry before my senior year, I sat down with the GC, told him my enlisted, and I didn’t even consider college until I got to my first post in DC, and really good junior officers there. In addition to your classes, all the essential subjects in the Marines, they had impromptu classes about their experiences in college, how to write an essay, we had to write an essay about 3 things we would do to make life better. 

A week leater the LT. Said “where’d you learn to write?” He said How come you didn’t go to college, that was the first time I realized that you didn’t have to be Einstein to go college, so I would say it was good leadership that woke up my brain. That’s the truth, a really good LT that said I write better than most of the people in this unit. Made me realize that reading and writing is valuable.

Made NCO, played Rugby, the LT would tell me how much fun college is, that you don’t feel like it’s a chore, you can study things that you are interested in. I’d have to credit the early leadership to get me to pursue education, I’m a student for life because of that.  

At my first duty station - my first posting. When you get to your first permeant post, you have a Platoon Seargenet and Lt. (Mom and Dad) that’s where real progress was made. 

There were 30 marines in that platoon, everyone heard that same message, the Marine corps owns you for 4 years, if you sign up for these edu programs, it’s there, we used to temp to go to school instead of just letting the money sit, although we are 18 and carry guns, it’s a big wide world and edu and knowledge was crucial. 

6.	What are some of the specific things that you think about as you evaluate different educational options? What makes one option more appealing to you, vs. another? 

Career travel was motivating, visiting other countries
Like to read, like to do research
Wanted to be involved with something, wanted to learn that whatever topic I grew interested in, how to deep dive into it so that I could fully understand it, found that in Universities. 

When I was 18, you see Animal House, you see College Football, I toured a few, but it was just a day out of HS to go do it. It’s not until someone tells you that you’re the kind of person that. U wants that you start believing. it. 

(Transition to observed usage of the web)

7.	Let’s say your ready to do some research online regarding your education. What would you do? 
(Observe)

For each website used (Up to three that are not VA.gov):

Google
My first thought, was how much does this cost
My second, where am I gonna live, proximity to my family
Was important when I decided. 
Looked at if I get out of the Marine Corp, reserves, where will I live, what schools are near there, and how much is it gonna cost.
I would said “Ohio colleges”
I see ten schools, pictures of schools, this is how I went about it, but without the graphics, took in my knowledge (you had visited some of them), doesn’t apply here, we were never Bengals fans, followed Ohil State
Ohio State was high on the list
Miami was high on the list
When I had to choose, a book came out called The Public Ivy’s 
Milami, UT Austin, a few more. I saw it as being kind of the highest level edu that I could get to and afford. 
Being a son of a union auto worker, go to a school with academic prestige, that’s what I set my heart on. Talked to LTs, Captains, one of them said, have you heard of MESAP, as soon as I was told, I went and I looked the Marine Corp order and I found it, it said every year the Marines picked 60 sergeants, and you go to school, maintain your active duty status, added that to my prayer list

I would use the graphics, a list of 126 Ohio Colleges and Us. Without clicking on it, it lists based where they are at, shows basic instate tuition. Over on the side there’s a map of Ohio, they slowly start popping up little dots, I’m thinking in terms of proximity to my home town. I’m going to get out, transfer to my reserves, move to my support base, 

Proximity, to where my family is from
Whether there is a reserve unit nearby and the cost

In order
Proximity
Costs
Possibly nearby reserve unit
Opened up a second window, found the state of Ohio, 
Google: Typed in Ohio USMC reserve units

First thing is 3rd Battalian, Brook Park, 
1st Battalion,
Scrolled down through the links, found out where those units are, I see that once in Cincinnati, communication company, 

Look to see what kind of unit it was
* Headquarters and service company
* 3 rifle companies
* Infantry company - wanted to stay in that

Looked for the Ohio Reserve Unit, and if it fit within the proximity of my hometown (300 miles). Literally the entire southern half of the state of Ohio. Had I went to reserves, I would have gone to Ohio state. 

8.	(If they don’t use VA.gov) Let’s take a look at the Veteran’s Affairs website, and see what’s available here to help you in planning and meeting your educational goals. 

I would go to the Post 9/11 GI Bill statement of Benefits
(The first window, says “check your Post 9/11 GI Benefits” 
I’d check that first to see if I would qualify
LABELLING ISSUE
I would sign in and create an account

(Thinking about doing a PhD)
Love doing research and love teaching, I’ve been putting this off, got me interested in looking back into it again.

Am I eligible to use this tool, 
* I have applied
* I have received a decision
I haven’t signed on in a decade

Single result, to broaden the results of the search - filters appear when there’s only one result _ error 

Hitting country, USA, state VA, etc. 

Doesn’t know what to search under programs

I would look at the program they offered before I look at the school, so I would do that (already have) click on details, to provide more information, 

Out of pocket tuition: that’s what I’m looking for, especially when it’s zero
2200 GI Bill
Doesn’t ask me what level I would be enrolling, (e.g. PhD candidate)
I’m certain it’s set up for the larger sample size, majority of marines, not necessarily for an older guy, no choice that I can see that shows me at what level I’m applying. 

I’m not saying I don’t like that, if I was enrolling to go to college, I don’t see any questions I have that’s not listed here.

Doesn’t ask me to specify at what point I’m coming in, what I’m applygin to that I can see. 

Has all the institutional summary, types of accreditation, etc. 

That would be the only thing I would still have to be searching

This screen is geared towards the majority veteran group, people applying to go to college. I don’t see anything that allows me to say what level I’m coming in, geared to the undergrad 

Don’t see anything to program of choice, maybe Career Scope?

Choose that because it seems like it offers beyond the bachelor degree, or maybe professions beyond the degree. 

	(Observe)

	1.	Tell me what you found appealing about VA.gov. 
	2.	Do you feel like it answered your questions or helped you in your planning? How? 
	3.	Have you used this website before for this purpose? Where did you first hear about this website? 
	4.	What would you do next with the information you’ve gathered at this site? 

9.	What other questions do you have for me about what we’ve looked at and discussed today? 

I don’t, I don’t know how much more I can emphasize that the Marines aren’t hearing enough about it, if they have good leadership, the junior officers, they are telling them that they have all these opportunities, you can also work for some bum, and you have this opportunity and you never get the chance to use it. 

That was the CRUCIAL time to learn about these benefits - for a LT. To tell a Corporal “why you didn’t go to college,” do you have any idea how many oporutnites are available? IT was priceless. 

This benefit sits here, you hear people talk about it, the its’ mainly people telling you, reminding you to do it, that motivates you to do it really. That makes sense. 

## Closing

## Session 4: Teana
(Approx. 3 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kevin and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how you've learned about benefits they have related to your education and career, and made decisions about your educational and career goals.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and our audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.
[Once recording],

My screen is now being recorded.

## Framing and background
(Approx. 20 minutes)

We're going to be talking primarily about behaviors and tools you may have used related to pursuing your educational goals. Because we're talking to Veterans and active duty service members that are at different points in pursuing their educational goals, some of the answers you share may be based on your memory of what you've done in the past, and some of the answers might be based on what you might do in the future. 

After about 15 minutes of chatting or so, we'll switch over the the web, and I'm going to ask you to show me some of the things you may have remembered doing, or things you think you'd do to do this kind of planning.

Any questions before we get started? 


1.	Tell me about your military service.
	I’ve been in for 5 years, I have 3 more to go, thinking about getting out after this term. I think that going through this class would be really beneficial, going through this class, I can help you guys make it easier for me in the future. 

	  1.	(If active duty) What is your planned transition date to civilian status? 
In the next year, still have 2 more years, after that I’ll transitioning out. 
	  2.	(If Veteran) When did you transition to civilian status? 
2.	Have you thought about taking advantage of the educational benefits provided by the Veterans Affairs administration? 
Yes. 
	  1.	(If active duty) Are you planning on taking advantage of these benefits before you transition to civilian status? 

Thinking about after I transition, it’s very time consuming being in the military. 

3.	(If yes) What benefits are you thinking about taking advantage of? 

Right now, I have the post 9/11 thinking about using that when I get out. 

Want to go to college, get a degree. Business Administration. 

4.	Where did you first learn about educational benefits?

	Boot camp. 

	I was in Boot camp, they explained when we get out we can have college in the Mot. Or Post 9/11. (I don’t remember, they came in and talked to us, fill out a paper saying which one that we choose) If you choose Post 9/11 you can’t switch to Mont. A lot of us choose Mot. Where you do 1200. No one understood the diff at that time. 2016, I started googling whatever popped up on google on the diff. Between the two, on the vs. sheet I decided that the Post 9/11 would be more bene. So I switched. 

Why the switch?

The stipend you get, $1000, the basic housing allowance, they mentioned the school costs however much money they cover it, the Mont. you are limited to a certain amount of money. 

I didn’t know too much, so I choose Mont. because it would be best. 

I assumed it was before I could get out, maybe a year before. You get out. That was just from people, I guess, our leadership, saying it. Not giving us proof, saying you have to make sure you switch before you’re out. 


	  1.	(If Veteran) Did you attend the TAP program? 
	      1.	(If yes) When? What do you remember about that program? 
	  2.	(If active duty) Are you familiar with the TAP program? 

		Not yet. 

	    1.	(If yes) Tell me what you’ve learned about the TAP program.
5.	What are your goals related to your education? What kind of career are you pursuing? 

Business Administration. My goal so far is to either go back to Az and work on Luke AF base, do what I’m doing right now, I’m in supply. Or I can, my background, I am Native American and I want to work in Indian Health services along those lines. 

6.	What are some of the specific things that you think about as you evaluate different educational options? What makes one option more appealing to you, vs. another? 

Military friendly, if they have a vets programs. I know that AZ has the Pat Tillman program. That really, I want to go there. Other Vets will go there, and they say good things about it. 

More personal, my uncle was in the Marine corps, I kind of copy catted him. That’s what makes it appealing to me. (Follow in someone else footsteps.)

(Transition to observed usage of the web)

7.	Let’s say your ready to do some research online regarding your education. What would you do? 
(Observe)

1. Google: Best military friendly schools for B.A. 
2. I would click on 2019 Best Friendly-Military Online Colleges
* Because it has a military friendly score of 99.49
3. www. guidetoonlineschools.com/online-schools/military-friendly
* “Military friendly score” they will make the process easier for you transition out of the service into going to college
4. Go back here, and click Arizona State University
	* Because I want to move back there, my family has gone to school there, I want to go to school there as well
5. Just acting for contact inofmraiton so it can send you a brochure or an email, about what you are interested in. Wouldn’t resubmit your information
	* They already have it, I submitted it in December just to see what they have to offer me. 
	
Online - I didn’t realize I was looking strictly at online schools - I saw that military friendly points. 

Task: Knew you wanted to go AZ, attend in person. How can I start preparing for this? 

I want to know the credits that we have for joint service, would they accept. Depending on the school, some people will accept more than others. 

1. Google: “Does ASU accept joint services transcript for business administration”
2. Veterans/Admission ASU State University Admission
	*Because it says “our mission is ASU accepts the following military transcripts…” 
3. ASU admission/veterans
	* I see that’s on the screens, the LIA 294, that’s an intro course for Vets specifically  - I think it’s really cool that they offer that course
	* They have a quote from someone int he Marine Corp saying that if you are in the right course
	* Just found the military transcripts portions
	* Click on the JST Link underneath military transcripts
4. JST - link
	* Not secure
5. Go back one step, click on more about transferring military credits
	* Military Credits, reading that section
	* Read the bottom paragraph, the JST - rewarding to , answer - evaluated a the time of submission to ASU, you’ll know what credits will transfer over

SITE THAT’S NOT SECURE - error

1. JST Site - Been in one time
2. CAC user - military IDs. I’ve used it with the CAC. I don’t have my username or password. 
3. How to request an official transcript
4. Register for a JST account (already have one, don’t have CAC reader)

8.	(If they don’t use VA.gov) Let’s take a look at the Veteran’s Affairs website, and see what’s available here to help you in planning and meeting your educational goals. 

DIDN”T THINK OF USING THE VA WEBSITE 

Never gone to the VA website

VA websites into Bing Search Bar
The first ones talking bout a loan, the second one doesn’t look like it
1. VA.gov
	1. Dismissed Mission Act
2. Education - Check your post 9/11 GI Benefits, wait never mind Compare GI Benefits by School
3. Arizona State University, Choose Tempe
	1. Choose tempe, the first one that populated on the bottom, it populated on the bottom, this is the main one
4. 100% In state Tuition - would we only be paying if we were AZ residents, - do I have to be a resident? 
	1. Do I have to be AZ resident for AZ instate, or all Vets getting 100% instate tuition
5. View Details
	1. 6230 Gi Bill students, want to Learn More but want to scroll first
	2. It has a calculator, I would mess with it to see if I click No
	3. Clicked No, changes when I click No
	4. Out of pocket tuition is 16,580. Uh… that I would have to still pay. If you were out of state. No I’m not, but I am an AZ resident, cuz that’s my home address. I’d get In state because I’m , it’s my home of record
6. Would look at the Yellow Ribbon Recipient, because they don’t know what it is
	1. So the YR would cover private degree granting schools and out of state tuition. Thisis something that I wouldn’t need but if I wanted to go to school elsewhere, I would have this because I was out of state. 

Feels like it answered the question? I want to learn more about the tuition and fees, click on Learn more

Also, what it would cost - it just says Fall and Spring - 

7. Learn more for tuition and fees - paid directly to the school, pays the in-state. I just want to know if that would be ALL the classes that I’m taking? How many classes per semester, I want to see how many classes I take so that I don’t go over the benefit total amount. 
	* How many Vets and Family are using the GI Bill benefits

I would go down still, the elibitlity details, just to see, I did that already, click on the 
8.  scholarships Learn More (Didn’t quite understand) 
9. Looking at the Retention Rate and Grad Rate
	* Because if I were go to school if everyone wasn’t graduating, a lot of them aren’t graduating, that would be a concern
	* Why? Actually I’m not sure, is this for Overall or just for Veterans, it is Overall, or just for Veterans
	* I’m interested in both, bu the Veterans has no data, so I can’t go off anything to me, the Veteran data would be VERY interesting to me. To know, oh, I can do it kind of thing. 
	
Question: Interested in highest Veteran Graduation Rate

Look at Student Complaints

10. Student Complaints Source: like the numbers, is it 12 ppl, if it’s reported, I don’t know

They didn’t click on Student Complaints, but then they did click on it

Same result

Frustration (there’s no way to read) 

How do you feel about this session? 
I think it was fine - we all don’t 
TRS we go before to before we go out. I didn’t know I could look at the schools I want to go to on the VA website. A lot of us are shooting in the dark. The tools are here, but we don’t know where to look for it. We use Google, or what other people say about what schools are “military friendly.” 

It’s a really good website, I didn’t know about the out of state, how much I would have to pay. 

Yellow Ribbon - the original website, that had a little yellow ribbon, it’s good to go onto t he VA website to confirm the yellow 

	(Observe)

	1.	Tell me what you found appealing about VA.gov. 
	2.	Do you feel like it answered your questions or helped you in your planning? How? 
	3.	Have you used this website before for this purpose? Where did you first hear about this website? 
	4.	What would you do next with the information you’ve gathered at this site?

## Session 5: Erika 
(Approx. 3 minutes)

## Framing and background
(Approx. 20 minutes)

We're going to be talking primarily about behaviors and tools you may have used related to pursuing your educational goals. Because we're talking to Veterans and active duty service members that are at different points in pursuing their educational goals, some of the answers you share may be based on your memory of what you've done in the past, and some of the answers might be based on what you might do in the future. 

After about 15 minutes of chatting or so, we'll switch over the the web, and I'm going to ask you to show me some of the things you may have remembered doing, or things you think you'd do to do this kind of planning.

Any questions before we get started? 


1.	Tell me about your military service.

Marine corps 2013, went to boot camp in Dec, Grad BC in March of 2014. San Deigo in Dec 2017. 	

	  1.	(If active duty) What is your planned transition date to civilian status? 
	  2.	(If Veteran) When did you transition to civilian status? 

Dec 2017
2.	Have you thought about taking advantage of the educational benefits provided by the Veterans Affairs administration? 

Yes

	  1.	(If active duty) Are you planning on taking advantage of these benefits before you transition to civilian status? 
3.	(If yes) What benefits are you thinking about taking advantage of? 

I’m actually using the post 9/11 Gi Bill, no other benefits? 

4.	Where did you first learn about educational benefits?

TBH my father is a Vet, I learned gerneally about it from him. He knew less than I did, I learned more about it when I was active and I was planning to get out. I went to Higher Ed seminars (to the best of my knowledge, MCS, something to that extent. The run all the programs that go on in the library - CSS - the MCS near Mar, there’s only one library, on base library)  that were hosted at the library, where to apply for the GI Bill, how to activate it, 

When I went to TRS, they kind of solidified what I had learn in that seminar. 

TRS - transition readiness seminar. 

	  1.	(If Veteran) Did you attend the TAP program? 

TAP program? I’m not sure to be honest, that doesn’t sound very familiar. 

	      1.	(If yes) When? What do you remember about that program? 
	  2.	(If active duty) Are you familiar with the TAP program? 
	    1.	(If yes) Tell me what you’ve learned about the TAP program.
5.	What are your goals related to your education? What kind of career are you pursuing? 

Studying psychology, at a Community College, didn’t take ACTs or SATs, been out of school for awhile. Shooting for my associates in psych, finished next winter, after that focus in on forensic or criminal Psych at least a masters. 

Haven’t been in school since graduating HS. 

6.	What are some of the specific things that you think about as you evaluate different educational options? What makes one option more appealing to you, vs. another? 

Location - that’s important. I’m not trying to drive two hours for school, but also just the benefit itself was import to me. I had to give up Mont. because the community college didn’t take it, but its’ the only CC around here. Most of the other college don’t accept the Mont. as tuition payment. It covers some things other than tuition. Obv. Tuition is the majority of the case. 

I was looking at other colleges, they din’t even know what the GI Bill was. 

(Transition to observed usage of the web)

7.	Let’s say your ready to do some research online regarding your education. What would you do? 
(Observe)

To be honest, I’m not sure, I’ve looked into it a little bit, a lot fo the college don’t have forensic psych as a focus. They don’t have what I’m interested in. I guess for me I would have to hop on Google that find an online program

1. Online college forensic psychology
	1. I’m mores looking for credientials, I’m going to look for things I know automatically, that’s how I process things. I’ve never heard of Walden, Americans, , I’ve heard of ASU, so I would click on this
	2. Usually I go to the bottom, the top are usually just ads, I would go down to the middle and look for the ASU
2. AD: Clicked on ASU
3. Select program of interest on the right side
	1. Select Forensic Psychology, I don’t know the difference between the BS and the BA, a lot 
	2. It’s asking me for my contact information, because that seems a little odd. I’m trying to find info about them. I would if I researched the website a little bit better, I wouldn’t give my info out to where I don’t really trust. I would try to confirm that this website is legit before I put contact information in there. 

Okay with an ad they trust

Look at the middle of the page

Not really, these are just lists of affordable colleges, I’m looking for a list of colleges that have these lists aren’t the greatest, I’ll click on one of these links, but it’s not very information, it’s a waste of time

Change my search

I would delete the “online” phrase 

1. Google Colleges Forensic Psychology
2. Similar things came up, the ads, a list on the bottom/middle, Other things, 
3. Nothings really jumping out to me. As far as information. 
4. This one if I read further into it, the top one
5. Top 20 Graduate Colleges in Forensic Psychology, .org I can trust
	1. C
	2. This is interesting, I’ve never come across a website quite like this before, what degree, what category, select a subject, 
	3. These are not colleges, 
	4. There’s some accresitation
	5. I feel good about this one, not necessarily links to click on but I would read through all these colleges the are listed, try to find the one that fits what I’m looking for. Do a separate search for them, and research their college more specifically, and see if they college 
	
(Pick a college) - scroll through this list, look for one that I’ve heard of, I stick to what I know, look for one that sticks out to me, but I wasn’t a fan of the ASU site, so I will skip that one

UC Irvine - I’ve been in this area, I know this college. 

Try to see if I can click on it specifically.It doesn’t take me there. 

1. Google: UC Irvine
2. UC Irvine: UCI: Home uci.edu
	1. Usually when you are typing for a specific thing, it will come up first. Obv. Not interested in that
3. I would usually look for U websites, I like to find the stuff myself try by not using the search
4. Academics, 
5. Scroll through
6. Which specific area psychology would be under, it would be in one of couple places, 
7. I would click on the Fact Sheet for Social Sciences
8. Read through the bullet points, if what I’m looking for doesn’t apply, I’m not seeing anything about Psychology, sociology isn’t what I’m looking for, I might read through here to see if there’s anything potent
9. Go back and go to the website. It’s just too much of an extra step, too much an extra step, I don’t know if I would waste my time here, if psychology 

If I couldn’t find it on the website, that’s when I would combine search terms, I wouldn’t go all the way back to google, I would go back to the first, original website UCirvine, if I couldn’t find it manually myself. 

10. UCI home page search Forensic Psychology, search web
11. This to me looks just like another list of articles, from them. Most of it doesn’t excite me very much either. 

At this point, I would take a break, I’m hitting too many dead ends. I would just calm down, do something else, things like that. Right now for me I wouldn’t do anything else. Cut my losses. 

For each website used (Up to three that are not VA.gov):

	1.	Tell me what you found appealing about that website. 
	2.	Do you feel like it answered your questions or helped you in your planning? 
	3.	(If not found via Google, and not a first time visit) Where did you first hear about this website? 
	4.	What would you do next with the information you’ve gathered at this site? 

8.	(If they don’t use VA.gov) Let’s take a look at the Veteran’s Affairs website, and see what’s available here to help you in planning and meeting your educational goals. 

	(Observe)

Task UC Irvine Benefits

VA website
Google
VA gov
Va.gov
(Used before?) This actually makes a lot of sense, usually when I go to the VA website, it’s specifically go to the GI Bill, I usually go to EBenfits, I just enrolled in my fall classes actually, when I was, the page that says how many days I have left on my GIBill, it would always take me to this website, and this one wasn’t working at the time, this is interesting. 

Just makes sense, that’s why it wasn’t working, during that time, I was trying 

See what your GI Bill - for that specific thing, I would to my GI Bill page, how many months do I have left. Compare that against how much time you need to get through the program. Before I even to check to see, just in general to see UC Irvine, let’s fist see how many months of the GI bill I have left. Well, what’s covered, for this amount of time, now what are my options. 

Check Post 911 GI Benefits

Online Only 
UCIrvine
This to me is the closest thing, I don’t know if they are the same or not. 

I would click on it, to see where this goes, there’s not much else over here
Yellow ribbon stands out, but I’m not concerned about that yet. 

The number thing
GI Bill pays the school nothing (Result for Irvine U) 
To me that’s not okay, does that mean they don’t cover anything? 

Other things?
I’d look at that first, Housing allowance is too low for California, how it’s broken down by semester types, 


	1.	Tell me what you found appealing about VA.gov. 
	2.	Do you feel like it answered your questions or helped you in your planning? How? 
	3.	Have you used this website before for this purpose? Where did you first hear about this website? 
	4.	What would you do next with the information you’ve gathered at this site? 

9.	What other questions do you have for me about what we’ve looked at and discussed today?

## Session 6 : John 
(Approx. 3 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kevin and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how you've learned about benefits they have related to your education and career, and made decisions about your educational and career goals.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take about 50 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and our audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.
[Once recording],

My screen is now being recorded.

## Framing and background
(Approx. 20 minutes)

We're going to be talking primarily about behaviors and tools you may have used related to pursuing your educational goals. Because we're talking to Veterans and active duty service members that are at different points in pursuing their educational goals, some of the answers you share may be based on your memory of what you've done in the past, and some of the answers might be based on what you might do in the future. 

After about 15 minutes of chatting or so, we'll switch over the the web, and I'm going to ask you to show me some of the things you may have remembered doing, or things you think you'd do to do this kind of planning.

Any questions before we get started? 


1.	Tell me about your military service.

I’ve been out since 89, I was medically discharged, since them, went to work for a couple of businesses, finally stuck with the city of Carry NC, worked there for 7 to 8 years. Started my own business, Worked there for 20 years, my disability caused me not to be able to work at that job again. One of my friends told me that they were going to school through Voc Rehab, I was like, no, but a school called me up, because they wanted the money for the benefits, they wanted me to talk to them, why go get certifications when I can get my bachelors degree and certifications (Information Systems and Cyber Scrutiny Degree), researched it, a lot of stuff on the web, put my stuff together, so when I did go to the Voc Rehab counselor, I had all my ducks in row. 

Looked at a lot of schools, but he commute was a problem. Found an online program that would accept my Community college credits, wouldn’t take me as long. Found Columbia Southern, in Orange Beach AL. They had a great program, I liked everything from the instructors, it wasn’t easy, but I managed to pass and graduated with 4.0. Back in November. 

Been looking for a job, just landed a job last week, haven’t started yet, supposed to start on the 29 of July. 

Right now I’m taking some CISCO classes
Studying for the IFC squared, CISSP exam, for those certifications. 

	  1.	(If active duty) What is your planned transition date to civilian status? 
	  2.	(If Veteran) When did you transition to civilian status? 
1989
2.	Have you thought about taking advantage of the educational benefits provided by the Veterans Affairs administration? 
	  1.	(If active duty) Are you planning on taking advantage of these benefits before you transition to civilian status? 
3.	(If yes) What benefits are you thinking about taking advantage of? 

Have used Voc Rehab, when I first got out, I wasn’t in that long, less than a year. I wanted to take, I was putting money into the GI Bill, but they told me I wouldn’t get that money back. I never used them. So I guess after I started working, my business, I figured I wasn’t going to go back to school, but my disability got worse, trying to do the stuff I was doing, I couldn’t do it. 

My wife was like this might be a good time to go back to school, get your education, did that on my own dime through a Community College. 

After doing that, trying to get a job, they still wanted not only certifications but a Bachelors as well. 

When the guy called up, I’m not just going to do the service, if the VA is going to pay, I might as well get the BS, not just the Certs. 

4.	Where did you first learn about educational benefits?

Learned about it from a friend, his name DB, he was a Vet utilizing the program. Matter of fact, still in school. He just finished his morticians degree, now he is taking a business degree to go along with that. Starting his own funeral home. 

	  1.	(If Veteran) Did you attend the TAP program? 

Back then, I don’t remember them having anything like that. I was stationed at Fort Lee at the time. We went to the block house, where we did all the administrative stuff. Got out of the army, that was it. They told me they would sign me up for the VA benefits, I would be good, and sent me home. I was 19 or 20 at the time. They sent me home, of course, I was denied benefits, and once they denied me, I might of went one or two times, and I said you know what, I’m young, I got a lot of life ahead of me, I didn’t worry about it, I went ahead and did what I needed to do to take care of my family, after running a successful business, I couldn’t do it any longer, that’s when I sought benefits again, and got someone to help me through the process of filling out the paper work for the benefits, the medical benefits and the compensation benefits. 

It wasn’t a VSO, but it was a guy up in Durham that helped me along to start out with. We sent something in, they sent it back denied, they didn’t look at the evidence, when I sent it back in, they granted me service connection. 

	      1.	(If yes) When? What do you remember about that program? 
	  2.	(If active duty) Are you familiar with the TAP program? 
	    1.	(If yes) Tell me what you’ve learned about the TAP program.
5.	What are your goals related to your education? What kind of career are you pursuing? 

Going after an entry level, a security analyst, but my goal is to work in the auditing and compliance field of cyber security, creating policies, that sort of thing. The reason why, when I first got into computers was High School, I took the old Cobalt and PASCAL programming, did very well. I thought hey, I can go back and do computer again.

When I looked at Wade Tech programs, it was kind of vague, at the time I was looking it was Computer networking, working with CiSCO equipment, other classes along with that as far as Linux, red hat, windows classes, that sort of thing, after trying to find a job doing that, everyone was like “you’ll need a bachelors degree,” 

Got into a cyber security with Wade Tech, get your Net Plus, the ACT program. That was for Veterans. They would get a grant through, that lasted about a couple of years, but I did get all 3 certifications through that program. I also did a certified hacker class, which was very hard. Didn’t get my cert, but learned a lot of things. Found out that I didn’t want to do technical stuff as far as being a White Hat. That’s why I chose the program that I did, auditing and compliance and writing policy. 

6.	What are some of the specific things that you think about as you evaluate different educational options? What makes one option more appealing to you, vs. another? 

* Did research
* Looked at different jobs int eh field
* Knew what certs I could get
* Without the BS it would have been hard to move up. 
* I’m not a person that likes to stay stagnant in one place
* Had some ambition
* I figured get the bachelors degree, no one can hold that over your head in competition

(Transition to observed usage of the web)

7.	Let’s say your ready to do some research online regarding your education. What would you do? 
(Observe)

For each website used (Up to three that are not VA.gov):

GO to google chrome
* Looking for a particular school, type in UNC Charolette, 
	* Because of location, nearby, and I had heard about them having a security program, heard about it from antlers Veteran named MS
* Click on Home, since they have academics , I’m going to click on that. 
	* What time of programs they may have
* Might click on Majors next, 
* Then go down, look for any computer degrees, they have comp. engineering, comp science with cybersecurity concentration
* Click on that
	* Then it shows Minimum of 2.5 for Freshman or Transfer
* Look at Courses I would have to take
	* I’m not a Math guy, the less math I have to take the better
	* I see that I gueess, if you didn’t hav etc take you would have to take 4 math courses, but I would probably would have to, I had to take a math.  I would have to take math to fulfill those credits. 
	* Itnroduction to discreet structures. If those classes were something I was looking to take
* I think it wasn’t totally online, so I am 3 hours from Charlotte, that was a no go for me. 

	1.	Tell me what you found appealing about that website. 
		They had the links pretty much spelled out for you, they bold program description letters, made it easy. If you wanted to know what the classes were about, you just click on a link under core courses, click on that now
Gives you a course description, credit hours, etc. When they offer the class, day evening. 

	2.	Do you feel like it answered your questions or helped you in your planning? 

Yes. 

	3.	(If not found via Google, and not a first time visit) Where did you first hear about this website? 

From a friend, I knew about the school, but heard about 
	4.	What would you do next with the information you’ve gathered at this site? 

I would go back to home., and find an admissions page, see if they had an admission page, click on that, see what requirements they would want from me to transfer my credits over. To this school.

NEXT WEBSITE

* I would go back to Google
* I would put in Online Cybersecurity Degree
	* I see Kaiser university online, I’ve never heard of them, I’m wary. I might look at the best online CS bachelor degrees, most affordable degree, try to save (taxpayers money) but I also want to get the best bang for the buck
	* I’d probably either do the best online for that year, or the top 20 cyber security 
	* Top 20 programs
* Top 20 programs, give me a broader perspective of different schools
* Going to that, it’s showing some of these schools I’ve heard of Souther New Hampshire University, heard of Purdue, but not global, looking for schools I’ve heard of
	* ASU, I saw that when I was looking
	* UMD, UMUC, Towson, University Arizona, Penn State, et.c 
	* Lots of Good Schools, I’ve heard of
* Next I’d click on one of them to look at their program, to see how long it was, how many credits, what they actually offered in their program, that sort of thing
	* I wanna look at their program, what it would consist of, it could be more technical, as far as what I want to do, as far as the auditing and compliance and stuff. I would look to see how much in depth they provided the type of teaching I want. 
	* And then even though I went to school, I don’t like going to school, look for the shortest program

1.	Tell me what you found appealing about securitydegreehub.com

This one, a lot of the schools that I’ve heard about are on here, some very good schools. Through linked, people , esp. UMUC, there’s a lot of people on LInkedIn that have gone to this school. They put on cybersecurity events throughout the year, they do stuff with. Not only do they have a good reputation of teaching these courses, when it comes to having that connection with the Gov’t. If you go to that school, when you come out, I’m pretty sure some of the gov’t agencies/contrctors are going to this school to find people for their new positions. 

	2.	Do you feel like it answered your questions or helped you in your planning? How? 

One of them. 

	3.	Have you used this website before for this purpose? Where did you first hear about this website? 

I have used it before, like I said, it was 2017, which I looked at it last time, some of these schools. 

*	4.	**What would you do next with the information you’ve gathered at this site?** 

Go to a website, research the program. 

**LinkedIn**

Mostof the time, I’m going through and I see, click on new posts, and certain things come up. This guy right here is talking about Amazon Prime stuff, proceed with caution. With shopping online. Knowing this guy I’m pretty sure that’s what he’s talking about, Cyber analyst

A lot of people post different things about what they are doing, where they went to school - I would see it. 

I don’t keno them, I just connected with them, may have talked to them through a chat, not all of them, but some of them. I may have asked them a question or two. What they liked, what they didn’t like. 


8.	(If they don’t use VA.gov) Let’s take a look at the Veteran’s Affairs website, and see what’s available here to help you in planning and meeting your educational goals. 

Columbia Southern Benefit through he VA

* Go to Google 
* VA website. VA.gov
* (No it isn’t my first time, used it for refilling prescriptions, checking on pill that I have in, ID card) 
* IF you were looking for a school, even though I don’t have a GI Bill benefit, I can click on that and it should take me to a list of schools
* Goes right to tnereing the school, it comes up
* Click on this School after entering it
* Online only says it isn’t available, but 

	(Observe)

	1.	Tell me what you found appealing about VA.gov. 
	2.	Do you feel like it answered your questions or helped you in your planning? How? 
	3.	Have you used this website before for this purpose? Where did you first hear about this website? 


*	4.	**What would you do next with the information you’ve gathered at this site?** 

I’d call the school, talk to the admissions counselor. 

Anything on this page that you feel like would help you do that? 

(I would want to make sure they were nationally accredited) 

I’d use the link to the school to get them to take me to their website.

Because we're talking to Veterans and active duty service members that are at different points in pursuing their educational goals, some of the answers you share may be based on your memory of what you've done in the past, and some of the answers might be based on what you might do in the future. 

After about 15 minutes of chatting or so, we'll switch over the the web, and I'm going to ask you to show me some of the things you may have remembered doing, or things you think you'd do to do this kind of planning.

Any questions before we get started? 


1.	Tell me about your military service.

I am active duty army officer, rank of major. Joined the army in late 2006, commissioned in 2007, my branch is logistics, that’s my background. If you’re looking at duty stations, assignments, around the US, Afgahn, Iraq, at the tail end of the arc of my career. Getting out fo the army in December. In the process of thnsitioning. 

	  1.	(If active duty) What is your planned transition date to civilian status?  December 2019
	  2.	(If Veteran) When did you transition to civilian status? 
2.	Have you thought about taking advantage of the educational benefits provided by the Veterans Affairs administration? 

Used the VA’s tuition assistance program, as well as the GI Bill top off. Both of those to get my first MBA online. Used the VA’s educational benefit, license and cert. reimbursement, to get 6 sigma, blackbelt cert. Currently using Post 9/11 to pursue a graduate degree in acuisitonts and supply chain management. 

MBA 2013 - less than 2 years, through Trident University 
MPS - 2016

UMUC no UMGC, as of July 1st. 

I already had 2 undergrad degrees coming in 2006. Graduated undergrad in 2002. 

	  1.	(If active duty) Are you planning on taking advantage of these benefits before you transition to civilian status? 
3.	(If yes) What benefits are you thinking about taking advantage of? 
4.	Where did you first learn about educational benefits?

Starting with my recruiter, it was part of the sales pitch, the post 9/11 go bill. I didn’t think too much of it, in my 4rth year in the army, I went to an essential, professional military edu. course. A friend of mine had enrolled in an online program, he was using the TAP and the GI Bill top off to pay for it. He informed me how he was paying for it, and then I immediately went over the local thing, and I stopped, about 8 years. 

9312371944

	  1.	(If Veteran) Did you attend the TAP program? 

Attended the TAP program, gone through the executive TAP course twice.

It’s a requirement for separation, you have to it within one year before your date of separation, took at 18mos then again at 12 mos. 

	      1.	(If yes) When? What do you remember about that program? 

There was a whole lot of instruction on VA edu benefits. You know I feel like this is probably happenstance with Military services, the bulk are filled with retirees, how do I fill about my disability claim paperwork. In both classes, the instructor talked about the benefits, just if you wanna know more, talk about to the benefit counselors, go to a website, the bulk of it has been disability. 

Content and makeup demographic was the same twice. 

At least at the TAP program at Fort Myer in Arlington VA, you got th one for your JR enlisted soldiers, then you have the exec tap course, more geared towards senior military officers, senior folks, civilians, 10 or more years, mostly retiring, or have high, in terms of rank, I was the lowest rank as a major, had the least amount of time in federal service, at 12 years of anyone in the room. 

	  2.	(If active duty) Are you familiar with the TAP program? 
	    1.	(If yes) Tell me what you’ve learned about the TAP program.
5.	What are your goals related to your education? What kind of career are you pursuing? 

MBA, MPS, brick and mortar, right now it’s a graduate certificate, initially, and then in time finish it up. Supply chain management and acuiqestion, MA or MS, not sure. 

6.	What are some of the specific things that you think about as you evaluate different educational options? What makes one option more appealing to you, vs. another? 

Personally, if it was something I could do online
At my Own pace, all o fit work and life commitments that I have
Have to navigate through, which Universities accept the VA’s edu benefits, that was another factor, 
Sort of the professional portion of what do I want to study and why. 

Getting the first degree made sense, it was paid for by the army, 
The degree I’m pursuing now, the 6 sigma cert. are meant to enhance my market value as I embark upon a civilian job search, pursue post military logistics. 




(Transition to observed usage of the web)

7.	Let’s say your ready to do some research online regarding your education. What would you do? 
(Observe)

For each website used (Up to three that are not VA.gov):

Going for the Graduate certificate in acquisitions in supply chain management 
* Google
* Top Supply Chain Management Online Degree Programs R
	* UMUC, I would do my research, which of these universities appeal to me, which of these programs, narrow it down to a few. Explore those
* 
* Next step, open up google, Google “Does UMUC accept VA education benefits?” Hit search. 

thebestschools.org

* I don’t recall if I went to this one, but probably may have
* You have to be careful with some of these, a lot of them are ad spaces, your going to click on something it will take you through, it may or may not take you to the university, a link to apply for a loan for edu. 
* Let’s say I look at these 25 programs, yoknow what NE is appealing to me
* Visit that
*
NortheasternUnversity.edu

Fill out this information, wait for a counselor to contact me. 
Include in my email, I am a active duty service member, want to use my post 9/11 GI bell benefits to fully fund my degree

I would wait to hear back from someone
Within about 30 minutes to an hour, someone will call you and they provide more information

* For my own personal search, I narrowed it down to 2 universities, UMA, and UMUC, but I knew that going in. 
* When I was in communications UMich, they knew right off the bat that they did not accept GI Bill benefits, for online master in supply chain benefits, struck that one out. But then, 
* Heard back from UMUC, they did accept the benefits, they immediately connected me with their Vet Service Office (VSO) at the university, from there it was easy. 
* They walked me through the process, made sure all of my enrollment and administrative matters were taken care of , helped me with my certification, submitting things online, to get payments. 

VA.gov

Have you been to VA.gov? 

Yes. 

Why? 

For me in my transition to get information about benefits available to me, services to help me with military trans. Into the VA health care system, out of the DOD. Mostly do with my edu benefits. How do I access those, how do I use those. 

	(Observe)

* I would go in Education tabn
* I would explore the drop down benefits
* I know that I have a program, that is going to require my GI bill
* I get information
* Since I have a. Working knowledge, I know I have to get a COE, I just wanna know, how do I get my benefits to the UMUC, I would click on How to Apply
* Navigate through the website, like I did, what I also ended up doing, 
* Took advantage fo calling the GI Bill phone number, I would take to an education counselor, verify the requirements, lay it out to them
* They were helpful too in verifying that the benefits would be accepted by the university as well. They would help me verify as well
* Then I would do everything I was interacted to do, online, over the phone, 
* Working hand in hand with Unveirty to get everything organized

Clicked on link HEADING OF NAV

* ONLINE ONLY,
* Unvieristyh of Maryland University College
* View details
For me the housing allowance doesn’t make a difference, not staying there, I’m doing this online (Already picked online) 
* It looks like it’s for an eudnergraduate program
* Made changes, didn’t see changes on the right
* Useful would be a dropdown menu - what kind of degree are you pursuing, whatever the university degree offers
* I’m looking at this and saying great, I’m going 
* It was a real time update, but I was scrolling down the page, I didn’t notice the update to it. 
* 

8.	(If they don’t use VA.gov) Let’s take a look at the Veteran’s Affairs website, and see what’s available here to help you in planning and meeting your educational goals. 



	1.	Tell me what you found appealing about VA.gov. 

* Well, I didn’t use the comparison tool
* I prefer to talk to a person and verify my benefits will cover 100% tuition. I prefer hearing from a persona as a verification. 
* There’s been otherghins about processing my paperwork that I’ve sent an email to an Edu Bene counselor and I’ve gotten responnses
* I didn’t want to chance it where I get a bill for 2 classes. 

One thing that would useful on this website overall.

If you know, if you have a listing of the online university for a particular area of study that do accept VA education benefits, I’m sure that there is a list somewhere. 

It would be helpful, a listing of all the unveirstis across that accept VA benefits as a primary form of tuition payment. Drop down by state, you can see the list of universes, 97, click on what I’m looking for. 

That is a huge build for the VA, I spend a lot of time reaching out to Universities, yes no do you accept tuition benefits from the VA. A lot say no. 
It would be time saving, 

It’s a federal agency, you don’t want to so unsolicited endorsement, but it would be a useful tool for the Veteran or the active duty service member, Online, in MD, Grad Cert., is there a way to search that. 

Why online in MD? 

For me it’s professional connection. Attend a U. Here in MD in Baltimore County, another opportunity for me to network, for the career field I’m studying and hope to get into, have professors who are local, to build network. 



	2.	Do you feel like it answered your questions or helped you in your planning? How? 


	3.	Have you used this website before for this purpose? Where did you first hear about this website? 
	4.	**What would you do next with the information you’ve gathered at this site?** 

A human says 

A human says something and it turned out not to be true, people give you bunk info around a process or a regulation, this is the way we’ve always done it. Vs. guess what, there’s a military reg. That says otherwise, we can change. 

With the VA, I haven’t experienced that, keep in mind, if we talk again in 6 mos, that situation could be totally different. Edu benefits, I’ve gotten my questions answered, that’s me asking the right kind of pointed questions maybe. As I transition into the HealthCare, maybe my tune will change. 

9.	What other questions do you have for me about what we’ve looked at and discussed today? 

No questions, Appreciate your time.

After about 15 minutes of chatting or so, we'll switch over the the web, and I'm going to ask you to show me some of the things you may have remembered doing, or things you think you'd do to do this kind of planning.

Any questions before we get started? 


1.	Tell me about your military service.

My contract goes through 2023. Ill probably sign up again after that to continue with military service. 

	  2.	(If Veteran) When did you transition to civilian status? 
2.	Have you thought about taking advantage of the educational benefits provided by the Veterans Affairs administration? 

* Curently using the post 9/11 Gi bill, when I was active duty, I was using Tuition assistance, and currently I just plan to continue using my benefits, if time runs out on that, I understand I am in the reserves and I’l use whatever TA is allowed to me. 

	  1.	(If active duty) Are you planning on taking advantage of these benefits before you transition to civilian status? 

Undergrad - English lit and secondary edu. 
A little bit of college back from 2001, started knocking out courses in 2016, didn’t focus on full time until Fall 2017, right out of active duty. 

3.	(If yes) What benefits are you thinking about taking advantage of? 
4.	Where did you first learn about educational benefits?

Tuition assistance learned about just from coworkers, in the military at fort drum in 2012, I didn’t take advantage of it until I met with Fort Meade, met with an Edu specialist on base and learned how to take advantage it at that time really. 

What did you learn that was different? 

Back in 2012, none of my coworkers, could really explain the process that well. We were on a constant deployment rotation, when you got home, school wasn’t a priority at that point. Never met with an edu specialist, and coworkers didn’t hav the info to lead the way. 

Coworkers -colleages in the military. 

	  1.	(If Veteran) Did you attend the TAP program? 

Attended TAPs in 2016 and 2017, attended it twice, really just taking advantage of every course they put out there. I attended the one week course but aside form that they have additional courses that they would hold single day events, that’s why I say 2016 and 2017. 

	      1.	(If yes) When? What do you remember about that program? 

I remember it being, I remember I didn’t like it because — it was very, I didn’t find it very informative. 

Anything more about edu benefits? 

Different between 9/11 and post 9/11 GI Bill, they could have gone more in depth with that. Also, I remember I would have like to have heard something along the lines of benefits that can be transferred to a spouse for upper level degrees. 

How would you find out if it is? 

Honestly, I’d google gi bill, call the va.  

	  2.	(If active duty) Are you familiar with the TAP program? 
	    1.	(If yes) Tell me what you’ve learned about the TAP program.
5.	What are your goals related to your education? What kind of career are you pursuing? 

High School English Teacher.

6.	What are some of the specific things that you think about as you evaluate different educational options? What makes one option more appealing to you, vs. another? 

* A large English dept. - was attending a private university at first, for IT, and it came to my attention that I wasn’t aware the GI bill had a price limit each year, I realized that school is taking probably 90 of that money a semester, I would have had to go on the yellow ribbon program. That was just information I didn’t know. I realized I hated computers, the English dept was tiny, wasn’t in depth, didn’t have the rouses I needed. Started looking for a cost efficient — something that, well  — school, large English dept. 
* Cost of the school


(Transition to observed usage of the web)

7.	Let’s say your ready to do some research online regarding your education. What would you do? 
(Observe)

* Google
* Maryland Universityies Tuition cost per spemenster
	* Myt main concern with leaving the private university, didn’t want to end up in the same boat, worrying at the last minute getting on the yellow ribbon program. Cost per semester
	* State that I live in, married, my wife has a good job
* CollegeCostCompare.com
	* I already know universities around me, Towson, I want a 4 year university, go past community colleges, look for the major universities in my area, UMBC, Towson, UMCP
	* I scroll down and look at those, the ones I know
	* There’s one, University of Baltimore
	* Towson above there
	* UMBC, looking at those
	* Making sure they  would fit within the allotment
		* I was at Stephenson, he told me what the number was each year, I remember looking it up online, but I don’t recall where exactly
		* As I recall it was 22 or 23K per fiscal year
		* Post 9/11 GI Bil
* I would just start researching the English depth., freviews on the degree parths, what the degree paths entail
* (Choose UMBC) 


* Go to Google.com
* UMBC English Department
* For perspective students
* And notice the MA program, immediately know there’s a correlation together, a path for a higher ed after the abachoerls
* Look at english.umbc.edu
* More than what I had at the previous 
* Looked at opoprtunities
	* That doesn’t interest me
* Looked at internships
	* Obviously, because in TAPS they tell you NETWORK NETWORK NETWORK, knowing that the college does want to put you in places, that stands out. Networking that got drilled into me during TAPS. 

* Google
* post 9/11 GI Bill
* Benefits.va.gov
	* Look at this start getting the process started
	* Going through, Oh man
	* “This is WAY too complicated for looking at.” There should just be a big old button right at the top, it’s a lot of information to cycle through and I’m still not sure I found what I’m looking for to starthe process of getting enrolled. 
	* What’s frustrating, using this highlighted, talking about hapyemetn rates, transferring GI benefits, but nothing for me yet
* Applying for benefits
	* And look I’ve done this a couple time now, it still took me a minute to find it, 
	*  Looked through the page, education benefits, 
	* Online at Vets.gov I would head there
* Vets.gov
* VA.gov documents are good to know
	* Find your education benefits form
	* Benefit wizard
	* Yes
	* No
	* No
	* Apply now
* Id’ sign in, I did it for my prefvious collage, it already has a lot of my information stored. 

DIDN”T GO TO GI BILL COMPARISON TOOL

Comparison tool
* Didn’t select reserve
* UMBC training centers
	* UMBC training centers, I don’t know what that is, my school is in Catonsville
* No results with “University of Maryland, Baltimore County”
* I don’t know I’m kind of confused at this point
* UMBC  - clicked on UMBC , went to UMBC training centers
]
Couldn’t get right result

DETAILS PAGE, LED THE USER THERE
* I like that it outright says the book stipend
* I like that it has labelled out there
* I like that it’s telling me out of pocket tuition, just for my own head, if that makes sense
* Nothings come out of pocket, 
* What I would have, a question about on here, is winter and summer courses, I’m currently taking summer courses, I kind of had to go about my research this summer to calculate out my BAH based on hours taken, there was no information on it out front, it would be nice if there was an option. 
To touch on that general area
* I like that it points out the credit for military training
* I wish I had seen the tbefore I enrolled, I went from a college that accepted some to another that doesn’t, so I like that that’s there.
	* I would throw that WAAAAAY up to here
* 

8.	(If they don’t use VA.gov) Let’s take a look at the Veteran’s Affairs website, and see what’s available here to help you in planning and meeting your educational goals. 

	(Observe)

	1.	Tell me what you found appealing about VA.gov. 
	2.	Do you feel like it answered your questions or helped you in your planning? How? 
	3.	Have you used this website before for this purpose? Where did you first hear about this website? 
	4.	What would you do next with the information you’ve gathered at this site? 

Let’s see, probably, it goes back down to nothing, I’d go through the enrollment process, the application process, because I like all the information 

Where you were getting ready to sign in? 

Exactly. 

9.	What other questions do you have for me about what we’ve looked at and discussed today? 

Additional Feedback
* The GI Bill comparison tool, I think that should be a bigger focus, that would have been, maybe it’s just me and I never clicked on it, I don’t know how you could do it. 

GI Bill CT is occupying the visual space of what is normally advertising. 

I feel interesting, it’s kind of interesting to show you all the struggle. 

## Closing

## Session 9: Josiah
(Approx. 3 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kevin and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how you've learned about benefits they have related to your education and career, and made decisions about your educational and career goals.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take about 50 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and our audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.
[Once recording],

My screen is now being recorded.

## Framing and background
(Approx. 20 minutes)

We're going to be talking primarily about behaviors and tools you may have used related to pursuing your educational goals. Because we're talking to Veterans and active duty service members that are at different points in pursuing their educational goals, some of the answers you share may be based on your memory of what you've done in the past, and some of the answers might be based on what you might do in the future. 

After about 15 minutes of chatting or so, we'll switch over the the web, and I'm going to ask you to show me some of the things you may have remembered doing, or things you think you'd do to do this kind of planning.

Any questions before we get started? 


1.	Tell me about your military service.

Went to graduate 2007 active duty 5.5 years. 2 years in Qatar, 3 years in Corpus Christi. Switched to the reserves, went to a Marine Safety unit, did 3 stints of active duty for operational support over 60 days during that time. 

Coast Guard academy 
2 years on Cutter, 3 years at sector Corpus Christi - active duty
2012 swithed to the reserves, Savanah
5 years 2012, to 2017
During that time I did the 3 stints of active duty for 2 plus months at a time, each time, for 3 separate times. 
And then transferred to Coast Guard in Boston, been for 2 years now. As senior reserve officer. 
Had one active duty activation, two weeks, for hurricane response, that was last year, October 2018. 

Coast Guard - entire time 

	  1.	(If active duty) What is your planned transition date to civilian status? 

At 12 years, try to ride it out to 20 as a reservist. I’m a civilian 90 percent of the time. 

	  2.	(If Veteran) When did you transition to civilian status? 
2.	Have you thought about taking advantage of the educational benefits provided by the Veterans Affairs administration? 

Currently using the post 911 gi bill

	  1.	(If active duty) Are you planning on taking advantage of these benefits before you transition to civilian status? 

While in reserves, 

3.	(If yes) What benefits are you thinking about taking advantage of? 

Post 911

4.	Where did you first learn about educational benefits?
	  1.	(If Veteran) Did you attend the TAP program? 

Yes I did the TAPs program. In Corpus

	      1.	(If yes) When? What do you remember about that program? 

Not a whole lot. No. 

First learned during my time at the academy just learning about the various education programs and benefits, as well as in my first unit, trying to help some of my crew members, get education and learn what opportunities they had. I did studying on my own to see what was out there. Research into the various education programs_benefits_requirements for them, 

	  2.	(If active duty) Are you familiar with the TAP program? 
	    1.	(If yes) Tell me what you’ve learned about the TAP program.
5.	What are your goals related to your education? What kind of career are you pursuing? 

In school now. Working on an MBA. Coast Guard Academy - 

Why an MBA? 

Really hoping to further my career options, opportunities. Just finished a M in Ed Tech. Working on building essentially building my own company. And MBA program is a great way to make connections, learn some of the little details that you might not get doing it on your own. (Running a business without the background)

Working on two different ones, one is an apparel company, we sell clothing and gear essentially to support first reposnders, the second is an Ed Tech company, developing distance learning courses for the maritime environment. 

6.	What are some of the specific things that you think about as you evaluate different educational options? What makes one option more appealing to you, vs. another? 

Basically I wanted a school that was highly rated in that program, top 50. I wanted a school that I know, the GI Bill has a max payout, tuition needs to be under the max payout, or that participates in Yellow Ribbon, and then also a school where I could do a hybrid of online and in class.

Why? 

I like the freedom o online courses, and the flexibility that is associated with that. GI Bill pays a lot more when you set foot on campus. I do enjoy the actual aspect of going to class. You don’t get the networking opportunities in an online program that you do in a classroom. 

(Transition to observed usage of the web)

7.	Let’s say your ready to do some research online regarding your education. What would you do? 
(Observe)

For each website used (Up to three that are not VA.gov):

Focus on the MBA

* Hybrid programs, both online and in person, I will need a school that’s close to where I am. 
* Top 50 MBA search, 
	* Then focus on links from US New or WP, Princeton Review
	* Highlight schools close to me
	* I’m in the DC area, I know the schools that are around, look to see which of the schools have that ability
* Top 50 MBA
	* like to use multiple windows/tabs
* usnews.com
	* Just start scrolling
	* Ones I see here, are expected
	* Penn State, Stanford, Harvard, all the ivies
	* Get down here UVA at 12 in VA, the main campus is 2 hours south. I know that they have satellite campus around the state. 
	(GWU)
* Open up their profile (in a new tab)
	* Preserve all my search history, etc.
	* Look at tuition, application schedule, details on the tuition
	* Rough class size, slightly less than 10% have served in the military, they at least have the connection
	* At the point, I would go to UVAs Business School website
* Type into the window UVA Darden
	* Google results: top link after an add is MBA program
* What I’m looking for here, is information on the 
	* Type of MBA they have
		* IE a lot of programs, executive MBA, professional, online
		* Looking to see what they might have listed
		* I see exec MBA, online MBA, education. 
		* The program where I can attend, 
		* Looking for online options, evening option
		* Work full time, can’t do a full time student
		* Looking for indicators, that tell me that their program will meet my particular logistic needs
	* Looking for something on here, what their location is, what their program set up is
* Start the same way, search GW MBA
	* Top link after the ad, start there
	* That’s where I’ll start
	* Right there I’ll see online part time, etc. 
	* I’m seeing right here this is starting to have exactly what I’m looking for. 
	* Top natural result

	1.	Tell me what you found appealing about that website. 
Usnews site: Know the publication, they put out rankings every year, that are fairly comprehensive and accurate with respect to how good the program is
Whether Yale is better than Duke, each program is diff. In a diff. way. The program I’m looking at if it’s on the list, then it’s more than just an accredited program, it’s a well respected program. It is about the network. It’s about the network, it’s about what the school overall can bring. That the name brings. So, I want something that, I didn’t want an MBA to say that I wanted to the degree. I wanted something just towards the field that I’m going to be in. Can help you network in that field. 
Education institution sites: Will they meet my logiciatal needs, campus locations, online hybrid, campus locations I can get to without sig. travel. It has course offerings, I’ll look at those, see what the program outline is, how long I expect the program to last, etc. See the tuition, see some sort of Vet or Military page. That might not be on the MBA site, it might be on the schools Main site to look for some soft of VA connection/page, connection, support, so that I know
1. That they’ve got students form the military, and if I were to ask their VA dept for help on filling out the paper work, I had a question, they’ve done this so many times, they know what they are doing
2. Depending on the school, MBA schools tuition are quite high. Good luck finding that within the annual tuition cap in that top 50 range. I want to see that they have yellow ribbon options to cover that missing tuitions. 
	2.	Do you feel like it answered your questions or helped you in your planning? 

Us news: Yes, and I can’t remember if used this back at the time, or Princeton review, but it definitely did help narrow down my search for specific programs. 
Logistical filtering: 

	3.	(If not found via Google, and not a first time visit) Where did you first hear about this website? 

Back in High School, those lists of top colleges, top 50 that, etc. 
Next I’ll look at their admission rewuqipremtns and admission package

* Admission MBA 
* Degree requipmrent, work my way down the list of steps to apply

	4.	What would you do next with the information you’ve gathered at this site? 

How would you assessed if the Post 911 bill covered the cost? 

Went to the VA website, looked up the tuition caps.

Searched VA GI Bill
Usually know what site I’m looking for, I’ll do a Google search appropriately. 
The first search result is the GI Bill site, below that I see Post 9/11 GI Bill, rate tables
That sub link is where I will start
* Post 9/11 GI Bill 
* gibill.va.go
I see the VAgov/site
* I would open them both and look at them side by side
* I’m wondering what one is going to have that the other doesn’t have, they are two separate sites, supposedly operated by the VA, what I will learn from one I might not learn from the other, but I want to find out
* gibill.va.gov
	* Skimming, looking for information on GI Bill application process, tuition caps, allowances, the yellow brick program which I see here, tuition top off thing, seeing what else this particular site has for information, whether or not there are direct links to more information based on what I see
	* After skimming through it, 
	* I’ve got two of the main links
		* Yellow Ribbon
		* See current payment rates for the GI Bill
* Current payment rates for the GI Bill
* Click on the most recent ones, effective Aug 1 2019
* Info I want right here
	* Public - all tuition 
	* Private or foriegn, up to X amount per year
	* GWU - Private
* Switch over to the other page
* Come to this page
	* Seeing a lot of the same stuff
	* This one has a comparison tool, this one has the apply button
	* I see here the benefits information, the rates, 
	* I’d click the benefits and rates 
* Rates on va.gov
	* Go right to the rates table
	* Takes me back, been Brought back tot he first website I went to
	* Seeing what I’ve already seen, I don’t really feel anything, I find it interesting that there are two very distinct and completely different ways, two different sites set up for some interim information, and they will all eventually direct to the same data tables 

DIDN’T USE THE COMPARISON TOOL

When did you learn about the Yellow Ribbon program> 

when the bill passed. Post 9/11

8.	(If they don’t use VA.gov) Let’s take a look at the Veteran’s Affairs website, and see what’s available here to help you in planning and meeting your educational goals. 

	(Observe)

I think I might have used the comparison tool before

* Choose reserve
* In person and online
* Type George Washington, it pulls it up, various campuses, pick the main one
* Automatically came up with the five options, I’m going to look down on the left side for the various additional search parameters, I know GW is expesinvie, 
* Clicked yellow ribbon
* Click on View Details
	* Seeing basic info
	* A lot of students use the bill to go here
	* Cap is what I saw in the Rate table
	* Telling me the tuition, I’m assuming it’s undergrad, because I feel like that’s the standard that people/programs give. To get the actual tuition for my program I’ll have to go back tot he site, look at the tuition and fees, tells me it’s undegrad
	* I KNOW this doesn’t apply to me, the out of pocket doesn’t apply
	* Housing allowance, that’s the other info I want, to know…
	* Of course the book stipend
	* I know that that doesn’t apply, because it depends, on how long, what semesters you go to school, it depends on school breaks, if I go in the summer, or not the summer, you only get the Housing when I attend school
	* I see calculator fields here
* I’d tweak a few numbers to see what this website spits out
	* Tge MBA, I’d pull up the MBA course requirements, credit hour charges, approximate, it’s 1900 credit hour, take average of 9 a semester, do some quick math, figure out that I’m spending 17K a semester, or 51300 per year, adjust it slightly down to 513000
	* I see how the numbers changed, I see GI Bill pays to school for P1, 
* I know that the GI Bill pays the school, the Yellow Ribbon program that’s not exactly how that works, it’s brokken down properly down below. YR is the school chipping in, if it’s in excess of what the GI Billpays. 
	* I see down here that the GI Bill is going to cover my whole, will cover al the differntce
	* If I were to go crazy and do 12 credits, which would be 68400, I see over here, so, there is going to be a cap to what GW is going to pay, that cap is essentially that 3 credit different.
	* Make a note to myself to stick with 9 as opposed to 12. 

	1.	Tell me what you found appealing about VA.gov. 

Like the fact that it does break these down by semester as much as it can. 
It does give me very solid estimate of what’s going to be covered and what isn’t per semester. 

	2.	Do you feel like it answered your questions or helped you in your planning? How? 

Helped a little bit. 
I do see how I should look at 9 credits vs. 12. I should plan, things out that way. Should double check with the GW VA office to make sure that I would indeed receive the yellow ribbon. Some schools put a cap on it. 

I also know that GW doesn’t cap the amount they pay, GW is that they will go OK, you still have to pay anther 14K, how about a 14K fellowship, how does that sound to you? GW does things that bring that out of pocket down to 0.

Seeing this makes me want to talk to the admissions office and the VA office AT THIS SCHOOL to make sure my bases are covered. 

I would go back GWs website, look up their VA office, Vets office, find out the contact information, and call or email. I would probably email initially. Get some names, see who responses, see what they respond with. If I have additional questions, Iv’e got a name, office hours. 

	3.	Have you used this website before for this purpose? Where did you first hear about this website? 

Not sure. 

	4.	What would you do next with the information you’ve gathered at this site? 

Should double check with the GW VA office to make sure that I would indeed receive the yellow ribbon. Some schools put a cap on it. 

9.	What other questions do you have for me about what we’ve looked at and discussed today?

## Session 10: Bonnie DIDN”T USE BENEFITS NOT QUALIFIED
(Approx. 3 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kevin and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how you've learned about benefits they have related to your education and career, and made decisions about your educational and career goals.

After about 15 minutes of chatting or so, we'll switch over the the web, and I'm going to ask you to show me some of the things you may have remembered doing, or things you think you'd do to do this kind of planning.

Any questions before we get started? 


1.	Tell me about your military service.

In the AF for 21 years, I retired in 1998, I pretty much joined to get an education and seethe world. I pretty much did that. I was over in Europe for 8 years, moved every 3 years. In the US a lot. Europe for almost 8 years. Then I had to get assigned to Hawaii. For 3 years. That’s where I completed my Bachelors. Took me a really long time to get to that point, just my interests. 

Started in MN, all that’s there is snow. Traveled to VA, Berlin, missed the wall coming down by 4 mos, went to NE, Turkey, assigned to Turkish base pretty interesting. While I was in Turkey/Ismir, when the Bosnia crisis started, I was a NATO assignment, some of us deployed, to Italy for that. Just the start of the war, they hadn’t started anything yet, went to HI, then I ended up in NC, that’s where I completed my Masters there. 

When I first came into the Military, I missed the GI Bill, I had to pretty much, I was on my own when it came to edu, get my Edu totally finished before I left the Military, then I retired from the military. 

	  1.	(If active duty) What is your planned transition date to civilian status? 
	  2.	(If Veteran) When did you transition to civilian status? 

1 Sept 1998

2.	Have you thought about taking advantage of the educational benefits provided by the Veterans Affairs administration? 
	  1.	(If active duty) Are you planning on taking advantage of these benefits before you transition to civilian status? 
3.	(If yes) What benefits are you thinking about taking advantage of? 

Haven’t taken advantage of any benefits, haven’t gotten to that part, to tell you the truth, in 1998, when had our briefing, they didn’t tell us a whole lot about what the VA benefits were, what we could do. They only told us about if you wanted to get disability, fill out all your illnesses. That was about it. They didn’t go into what the VA offered, but that was a long time ago. 

I wasn’t really aware of what the VA did, I moved to DC in 2000. I wasn’t too aware of what the VA offered until 2000. That was my first job, I worked at the VA, when I moved to DC, and I went tot he Voc Rehab office. They said that I had a degree, I wasn’t elibgible for anything. At that particular time, in my life, until, then I left the VA, got a job at another VA agency. Took advantage of their training opportunities. 

In 2006 moved from DC to Pittsburgh. This is my home, I got another job with the VA again, I was actually at the Voc Rehab office, it really wasn’t until I worked there, I learned about what the VA did offer for Vets. I couldn’t take advantage because I had a degree. I was working in a job that you needed that degree for. 

I saw a lot of other Vets taking advantage of the Voc Rehab program

Just the opportunities that the VA offered, even for employees, the VA encourages hiring if Veterans, they offer a lot of training opportunities. 

I went into acquieisionts. Went to classes all the time still, through the course of my working there for my job, let me think. 

Haven’t used any benefits. 

Thinking about using benefits in the future, pretty sure I’m not eligible. 

Retired twice, retired from the Gov’t too

Haven’t worked in four years, don’t miss it. 

Did a lot of traveling with friends, picked up some craft hobbies that I wanted to do

Can do nothing. 

I really didn’t knwo about the benefits, even in 2006. It was amazing the amount of stuff that the VA did do as far as education. 

I would tell peopel that I knew, make sure to tell people to check with the office. 

I hadfinished my degree program before I left the military

If I had learned in the 90s, probably the mid 90s I wouldn’t have, went to night school continually to finsih my Masters Degreee. The last 2.5 years I was in the miltairy, I would have got out and attended when I got out. 

4.	Where did you first learn about educational benefits?
	  1.	(If Veteran) Did you attend the TAP program? 

Yes. 

	      1.	(If yes) When? What do you remember about that program? 
No, because it’s a long time ago. I do remember the VA being there, I only remember them talking about applying for disability benefits. 

	  2.	(If active duty) Are you familiar with the TAP program? 
	    1.	(If yes) Tell me what you’ve learned about the TAP program.
5.	What are your goals related to your education? What kind of career are you pursuing? 
6.	What are some of the specific things that you think about as you evaluate different educational options? What makes one option more appealing to you, vs. another? 
(Transition to observed usage of the web)

7.	Let’s say your ready to do some research online regarding your education. What would you do? 
(Observe)

For each website used (Up to three that are not VA.gov):


	1.	Tell me what you found appealing about that website. 
	2.	Do you feel like it answered your questions or helped you in your planning? 
	3.	(If not found via Google, and not a first time visit) Where did you first hear about this website? 
	4.	What would you do next with the information you’ve gathered at this site? 


8.	(If they don’t use VA.gov) Let’s take a look at the Veteran’s Affairs website, and see what’s available here to help you in planning and meeting your educational goals. 

	1.	Tell me what you found appealing about VA.gov CT. 
	2.	Do you feel like it answered your questions or helped you in your planning? How? 
	3.	Have you used this website before for this purpose? Where did you first hear about this website? 
	4.	What would you do next with the information you’ve gathered at this site? 

9.	What other questions do you have for me about what we’ve looked at and discussed today?

## Session 11: Jeffrey	
(Approx. 3 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kevin and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how you've learned about benefits they have related to your education and career, and made decisions about your educational and career goals.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take about 50 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and our audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.
[Once recording],

My screen is now being recorded.

## Framing and background
(Approx. 20 minutes)

We're going to be talking primarily about behaviors and tools you may have used related to pursuing your educational goals. Because we're talking to Veterans and active duty service members that are at different points in pursuing their educational goals, some of the answers you share may be based on your memory of what you've done in the past, and some of the answers might be based on what you might do in the future. 

After about 15 minutes of chatting or so, we'll switch over the the web, and I'm going to ask you to show me some of the things you may have remembered doing, or things you think you'd do to do this kind of planning.

Any questions before we get started? 


1.	Tell me about your military service.

I was a quartermaster navigational expert, master, taught east los to enlisted officers, navigational expert on 2 diff. ships. Spent 15 years, 10 of it at sea. 

	  1.	(If active duty) What is your planned transition date to civilian status? 
	  2.	(If Veteran) When did you transition to civilian status? 

August 1990

2.	Have you thought about taking advantage of the educational benefits provided by the Veterans Affairs administration? 
	  1.	(If active duty) Are you planning on taking advantage of these benefits before you transition to civilian status? 

BD and an associates degree from Am. Disable 
They contacted me, I went to the VA for disability and asked me if I want to pay for all my school - the Disabled American Vets contacted me. Gave me everything I needed. 

3.	(If yes) What benefits are you thinking about taking advantage of? 
4.	Where did you first learn about educational benefits?

I knew about them before my military, both my brothers were ex military, I learned from them while they were in the service. 

	  1.	(If Veteran) Did you attend the TAP program? 

No

	      1.	(If yes) When? What do you remember about that program? 
	  2.	(If active duty) Are you familiar with the TAP program? 
	    1.	(If yes) Tell me what you’ve learned about the TAP program.
5.	What are your goals related to your education? What kind of career are you pursuing? 

I’ve got a BS in Marketing Management, and I got an Associates Degree in Computer Information Systems. Got them at the same time. Went to a private college instead of a state college. Went to the private college because I didn’t have to take, they took my military service plus what I learned in HS, applied it to my degree. 

It was a lot easier and a lot simpler. 90% of the time in a state college, you have to retake Math, English, History. For them to rehash stuff I learned in HS (it was a waste of time. ) You shouldn’t have to. Rehash it all over again. 

6.	What are some of the specific things that you think about as you evaluate different educational options? What makes one option more appealing to you, vs. another? 
(Transition to observed usage of the web)

Jones College 1994 BS and Ass. CIS
It was close to where I lived
Good curriculum
Applied at, in FL, you had to go to a FL community college before a University
Only two close to me were U of Fl and U of North Fl. The joke on U NF - we called it you never finish. They keep changing the curriculum and you can’t graduate. 
Jones college was cut and dry, here’s what you will learn and we will get you a job, and that’s what they did. 

7.	Let’s say your ready to do some research online regarding your education. What would you do? 
(Observe)

For each website used (Up to three that are not VA.gov):

I pursued marketing management, I was working full time and going to school full time. I found out that working MM work was good for what I needed. I was thinking CIS because I was thinking about programming, it was easier to take both at the same time. 

I would look and see what the curriculum was and what he requirements were, check their track record on how many people graduated, how many people have gotten work through their work placement program.

I would see how many alumnus that you would recognize. 

* I’d go to the college I’d be looking for 
* UNF
* Look at their alumnus list, actually I would look and see what they were offering
* Look at tuition
* How many people, what their graduating classes are
* See how many people are working in their fields. Keep a repertory of who’ve they’ve placed and not placed. 

Actual start
* Searched the term UNF
* Clicked on UNF education
* Check facts, fast facts
	* I’d look at University Profile, tells you undergrads, 13K, graduate 2100, total graduates
	* Average Freshman GPA
	* I don’t worry about SAT or ACT, I never had to take, since you gotta take it now, I would check those and see what they are. And then what majors they have, and their vibe
* Go back up to Alumni and Friends
* Look at alumni associations
	* Who is in the alumni association and such

	1.	Tell me what you found appealing about that website. 
	2.	Do you feel like it answered your questions or helped you in your planning? 
	3.	(If not found via Google, and not a first time visit) Where did you first hear about this website? 
	4.	What would you do next with the information you’ve gathered at this site? 

Which VA website would you normally go to? 

Let’s see I have, which one I got here already set up
That was government, that’s too big. 

My HealthyVEt

I’d go to VA ed
* I’d search VA ed
* Educational Benefits
* VA Education and Training Benefits

* Clicked on get benefits
	* How to Apply and such, 
* Clicked on GI Bill and Feedback
* This isn’t the site I would go to use for education
* This doesn’t have anything really for it. It just ells you what your benefits are
	* I would go the UNF site and I’d look for Veterans Benefit, Veteran’s assistance or Veterans Training
DIDN”T GO TO CT NATURALLY

What do you think GI Bill Comparison Tool

* Means you can probably compare the bills between what GI Bill you have
* Never used 
* Entered Zip Code, No Results
* Tried to click on State, there were no states
* Cant manuver around this thing because it won’t 
* Type city
* Select Jacksonville Fl
* Retyped, it’s not  changing, hold on
	* It’s giving me all these medical schools, baptist health, blue water, etc.
	* **Well, CDA training, technical insistute, if I wanted to be a CDA that’s fine, but if you’re looking for a specific school, this stuff has nothing on there, you have to go through all the pages to find something**

FAILED TO USE TOOL

* I Led him to UNF
	* Housing allowance should be dropped off unless you are going to live on the campus
	* They don’t have anything about scholarships, Pelle grants are free money, they don’t have anything for that, you have to apply for them, 
	* They have a lot of good stuff on there, it’s a more expensive school. They don’t have anything to tell you, you can’t do anything until you apply for edu benefits, you have to know what you’re applying for. 
	* They don’t have a good graduation rate
	* The salary information isn’t right, repayment rate
	* It doesn’t give you, before you apply for your GI Bill, your loan, you Gotta know what courses your taking
	* I’m looking at it, it doesn’t tell you what courses your taking
	* Click on Career Scope - that says Post 9/11 Bill for that

I’d like a listing of, because you’ve got “submit a thoruhou” feedback system. If you know you are going to go there, they should hav something that says list of curriculum, and they don’t. 

8.	(If they don’t use VA.gov) Let’s take a look at the Veteran’s Affairs website, and see what’s available here to help you in planning and meeting your educational goals. 

	1.	Tell me what you found appealing about VA.gov CT. 
	2.	Do you feel like it answered your questions or helped you in your planning? How? 
	3.	Have you used this website before for this purpose? Where did you first hear about this website? 
	4.	What would you do next with the information you’ve gathered at this site? 

How did you feel - it gave the information on how much you’ll get paid, but you won’t get paid the same amount of money based on what courses you take. Usually prices are different on all colleges when you do something like that. There me be 10-15 dollar difference. The chemicals (fees) you have to pay for. Doesn’t give you a break down on it, there should be a break down on what they are offering, how many hours you have to spend in the lab, help a person understand what hey are looking at. 


9.	What other questions do you have for me about what we’ve looked at and discussed today? 

You should be able to search by City, State, and Zip

Some people live closer in other areas, say you got a Veteran in Montana, there’s no close schools in Montana, or North Dakota, they put in Zip Code, they could find the closest school to him that he could go online with. 

Sold plumnbing_electrical_HVAC, had all the Mr Routers, from CA to Maine, my clients, when they let me go, Mr Rooter walked out way from them. 

Kids that wouldn’t go through the VA, I’d walk them through the procedures to get their benefits at the VA. Edu is the same principle, in Jacksonfville, has one of th largest retired population, you have the clinic and a VA center but it’s never open. If they could get someone to actually sit there in the VA clinic and help them walk through everything. If you go to job services, FL unemployment, they just give you a computer and tell you to look for a job 

There’s a lot that you guys could do to help the Vets. 

I’m 63 and I still do this stuff.

Any questions before we get started? 


1.	Tell me about your military service.

So I was in the army for 27 years, active duty, 1 year of reserves, just retired a year ago. 

	  1.	(If active duty) What is your planned transition date to civilian status? 
	  2.	(If Veteran) When did you transition to civilian status? 
2018

2.	Have you thought about taking advantage of the educational benefits provided by the Veterans Affairs administration? 

I just finished my first semester of full time school in May of this year. 


	  1.	(If active duty) Are you planning on taking advantage of these benefits before you transition to civilian status? 
3.	(If yes) What benefits are you thinking about taking advantage of? 

Post 911 Gi Bill

4.	Where did you first learn about educational benefits?

During the recruitment process, cuz I got at the time the Mot. GI Bill and the army college fund was part fo the package that was part of my enlistment. 

I actually just converted to Post 911 last year. 

Before or after transition? 

That’s a good question - I think I did it before because I wanted to be safe by I’m not 100%> 

	  1.	(If Veteran) Did you attend the TAP program? 

I did. 

	      1.	(If yes) When? What do you remember about that program? 

In general, there was a big part, 2 or 3 days on resume building and job hunting, briefings from other folks to talk about the transition from the military workforce to the civ. Work force. Took a separate education seminar, and a dress for success day.

It was given at the transition center, something called “Accessing Higher Education Benefits.” A real broad overview. It was just one day. 

	  2.	(If active duty) Are you familiar with the TAP program? 
	    1.	(If yes) Tell me what you’ve learned about the TAP program.
5.	What are your goals related to your education? What kind of career are you pursuing? 

1st semester. 

It’s a Bach in Ancient Studies. 

Why Ancient Studies?

I don’t know. The field I have been working in and the field I’m in now, in my summer job, is Arts Management, it generally requires a Masters Degree, I need the Bach before the Masters Degree. Doesn’t matter what the Bachelors is in. Ancient studies was the only scholastic hobby that I had other than music when I was in High School. 

MA Arts Management - not certain if that’s what will end up happening. 

How long on the Bach?

Take me 2 more years, 2.5

I was able to transfer a lot of College Level. Examination Program test credits, they took a lot of that. I’ve gotten half the credits I need to graduate, as far as required. General subject edu programs

What school

UMBC - 

6.	What are some of the specific things that you think about as you evaluate different educational options? What makes one option more appealing to you, vs. another? 
(Transition to observed usage of the web)

* That school is close to where I live
* It’s fairly highly rated school and 
* it’s a small school
* They seem more focused on academics than sports, which is important to me. 

7.	Let’s say your ready to do some research online regarding your education. What would you do? 
(Observe)

For each website used (Up to three that are not VA.gov):

Back in time, 

* Looking at UMBC
	* It was, when I did the TAP class, they had us, that was in the separate seminar, they had us look at two different schools, compare the costs, I looked at UMBC and Florida State. UMBC was pretty much, I had already decided that was where it was going to be.
	* My ex wife went to school there, while we were still together. 
* I looked at Academics
* Areas of Study, 
	* Then I would sscroll down and see what there was, I looked at their, I looked over everything to see what they had that I was interested in. I considered doing something with some sort of engineering, that wasn’t for me with my math placement test not being so great (Took a math placement test) Looked at Music, just out of curiosity, ended up at ancient studies. Came and saw what that was about
	* Figuring out what the program consisted of, what the requirements were, it looked interesting, tied it back into. My other interests from earlier in life. 

* Looked for Veterans Services
* (Internal site search) 
	* They don’t have a whole lot of Veterans program, I got involved in helping to fix the size of their Vet programs. We created a new student organization for Vets because they didn’t have one. They’ve changed all this since I did, it I read through all the FAQs to see what their process was. At one point hey had a really simple, list of this is what you do and the order you do it in. 
* Clicked on Benefits
* Based on that list, I went to the VA website, and applied for my benefit to use the GI Bill

	1.	Tell me what you found appealing about that website. 

It’s gone now, they had a really useful checklist of this is what you do first before you apply, you have to talk to the VA make sure you are eligible, once you ahh the approval letter, start the app with us, here’s the link for that, once you get accepted, there’s a semester certification form to make sure that the classes you’ve selected will be covered by the GI bill. That was really useful in clarifying how this school interacted with the VA benefits.

Anecdotally I’veheard that other schools have a larger VA support program. I don’t have any direct knowledge of it. I know that when I called, I was doing that edu benefits seminar, I was able to call FL state directly to the Veterans service offices. Answered all my questions 

	2.	Do you feel like it answered your questions or helped you in your planning? 
	3.	(If not found via Google, and not a first time visit) Where did you first hear about this website? 
	4.	What would you do next with the information you’ve gathered at this site? 

Checklist - followed their little roadmap, which basically the first step was to go to the VA and apply for your benefits. Based on what they’ve got here know, I would have gone to this page

* benefits.va.gov
* I think I look through the GI Bill Comparison tool to make sure I understood
DID USE THE COMPARISON TOOL NATURALLUY
What the implications of converting to the post 911 actually were. I would have logged in and done the applying for benefits process. 

8.	(If they don’t use VA.gov) Let’s take a look at the Veteran’s Affairs website, and see what’s available here to help you in planning and meeting your educational goals. 

* Clicked on Comparison Tool
* Typed UMBC
* UMBD noththe right one
* Typed University of Maryland, no results
* removed comma, 
* Added Baltimore County
* “That’s less than useful” 
* Too many suggestions, searched just University of MD
* Searched, UMBC was the first result
	* This all looks different than I recall
	* I like the little square here that lays it all out clearly for what you’re going to get
* Clicked on the Kicker bonus, I did that, the Army College Fund
	* Uh, This is actually way more information than I remember seeing when I did this initially
	* Yeah - the stuff down here, things available at campus, that’s interesting
		* Stuff that’s not available 
		* VetSuccess (not sure what that is)
		* Yellow Ribbon thing is important
* Clicked on retention rate
	* This is a little bit confusing
	* The retention rate, I don’t know what 88.1 percent vs 48% means. 
	* If I had to guess, I have no idea. It looks like it might, I mean glancing at it looks like 88 percent are retained after the first semester. The 48% I don’t know where the 48% is coming from. It seems like it would be the percentage of Vets retained, but theres no data. 
	* 



	1.	Tell me what you found appealing about VA.gov 

My recollection is that looked different, but that could just be fuzzy memories. Looking at it right now, the simplicity of what the costs are, and how the benefits may or may not cover them. In this case they do cover them. Gives you the info you need to plan, whether or not you get into the yellow ribbon stuff or not. 

	2.	Do you feel like it answered your questions or helped you in your planning? How? 

Yes. Knowing if I was going to have to make up the difference. 

	3.	Have you used this website before for this purpose? Where did you first hear about this website? 

Yes. It was probably during the TAP process that I first, certain it was, that they had us login and create an account on VA.gov if we hadn’t already. 

	4.	What would you do next with the information you’ve gathered at this site? 

So from here, If I decided this looked good I would click on the application for the benefits, I would click on Apply. 

9.	What other questions do you have for me about what we’ve looked at and discussed today? 

I don’t have any questions. I can say generally the process of getting the benefit approved, the application process for the benefit, and getting that done, I filled out the form on the VA website, got the latter in the mail. It was way easier than applying to the school. 

I’ve had this search problem on other non-va websites, it depends on obviously how the name of the university is input into the database, the VA has used the dash, the school uses a comma. So it would, if you saw when I first typed it in, I used a comma because that’s how the school does it

**SCHOOL NAMES DON”T MATCH IN WEAMS**

Make it looks like how the school refers to themselves. 

I actually found out about the research through the other Veterans at UMBC. We had a meeting, the school gave us some free food, some students had already enrolled in studies for the VA, they passed the link around.
