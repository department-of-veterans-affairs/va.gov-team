(Close existing applications for test users before new test, Get a phone number so that you can text if you are disconnected)

## Introduction
(Approx. 3 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kevin and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how you've learned about benefits they have related to your education and career, and made decisions about your educational and career goals.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take about 50 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and our audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

## Framing and background
(Approx. 20 minutes)

We're going to be talking primarily about behaviors and tools you may have used related to pursuing your educational goals. Because we're talking to Veterans and active duty service members that are at different points in pursuing their educational goals, some of the answers you share may be based on your memory of what you've done in the past, and some of the answers might be based on what you might do in the future. 

After about 15 minutes of chatting or so, we'll switch over the the web, and I'm going to ask you to show me some of the things you may have remembered doing, or things you think you'd do to do this kind of planning.

Any questions before we get started?
