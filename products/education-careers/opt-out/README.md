# Executive Summary
## User Problem Statement
There is a legislative requirement that Veterans must be able 'request to opt-out of information sharing with educational institutions' mandated to start on 8/1/2018.

## Solution Goals
### User Goals
Help users understand what information they are currently sharing with the VA/educational institutions and make it simple for them to opt out of sharing their info with educational institutions

### Business Goals
Comply with the legislative requirement before 8/1/2018 and improve the processing of this data through the use of automated processing (stretch goal depending on technical constraints).

## Assumptions
- The Edu backend systems are in place to handle this data
- There is an office that has people to manually review this opt out information

## Requirements and Constraints
- Shay & the stakeholder group have asked us to submit this data like the 1990 - turned into a spool (text) file and sent
- Stakeholders don't want to make the opt-out form prominent on the Vets.gov website

## Discovery Takeaways
- Q&A with EDU Stakeholders (Shay/Luke)

## Solution Approach
- A form that allows both logged in users and non logged in users to access the tool and opt out of sharing their VA Data with educational intitutions

#### User Value
- Users will have control of whether or not their information is accessible by educational institutions

#### Business Value
- The Stakeholders don't want to heavily publicize this tool because it prevents the educational institutions from accessing valuable Veterans data.

## KPIs
- Number of opt outs
- % of users that opt out after reaching the opt-out landing page
