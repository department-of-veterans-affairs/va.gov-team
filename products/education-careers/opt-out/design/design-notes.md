# Notes about the final designs

The screenshots in this folder reflect the final designs for the screens with learnings incorporated from usability testing. Here are some notes about specific findings and how we've addressed them.

## Landing page

#### Only one participant had prior information about the Forever GI Bill/Colmery Act

- The landing page will play a significant role in informing the Veteran about the Colmery Act, and what it means to opt out of information sharing
- The landing page provides a brief description of the Colmery Act and a link to learn more about it

#### A majority of the participants initially misunderstood what they would be opting out of 

- Some thought they were opting out of the entire GI Bill
- One thought he could select specific pieces of benefit information to share or keep private
- We've edited the copy to emphasize that while a Veteran's benefits may be *affected* in that their reimbursements could be delayed, or they will have to provide their paperwork, they will not be *losing* benefits.

## Reviewing information

The initial designs for this form did not include a Review & Submit page. The hypothesis was that because the form is so short, it was unnecessary to ask users to review the information. However during usability testing, most participants expected to be able to review the information they had input, and expressed concern that they could have mistyped one of the fields. The flow for this form has been modified to include the Review & Submit page once again.

## Remaining opted in

All of the participants indicated that they would remain opted in to the information sharing. The reasons for remaining opted in were the following:

- Concerns that opting out would slow down the process of getting their education benefits
- They did not want the burden of requesting and gathering their paperwork to deliver to the school
- They were not concerned about keeping the benefit information private
