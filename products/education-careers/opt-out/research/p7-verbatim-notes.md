(Emily)Before we dive in, why don't you tell me a little about yourself? Where do you live, what branch of service were you in, where did you go to school?

(P7)I live in Quinnipiac(sp?), was prior enlisted military police, army national guard, now I'm an officer. 

Have you ever used VA services? If so, what services have you used?

I've been to the VA health center here and for school. 

Have you ever heard of the Colmery Act, also known as the Forever GI Bill?

No m'am. 

I can scroll so don't worry about that, but take the time you normally take when you visit a web page for the first time. Look through this content and let me know when you're ready for me to scroll

Ok, I think the purpose of this is to make it easier for the schools to access our info instead of us having to get all our information for them. Is that what you're asking me?

Yeah that's it. How would you describe the information here to a fellow veteran and what you describe for them they could do on this page?

You can read more about the act and opt out. To not have to do the Forever GI Bill I guess. 

Based on what you've seen so far, what does it mean to opt out?

I guess if you opt out (pauses), 

No wrong answers here

I'm not really sure because I thought the schools already had that information to establish eligibility.

Is that something you've had experience with?

I'm doing that right now because I'm gong back to school.

What's that experience been like for you so far? 

The only thing has been the 22-195 where you've had to put all the time youv'e been active. We're trying to figure that out since I have so many DD214s. 
Other than that it's been pretty easy to navigate through the pages. 

What do you think it would mean for someone to opt out? What impact do you think that would have?

I think they would opt out because they wouldn't want the school to know how much they were paying for tuition and fees
so they wouldn't get overcharged for using VA benefits. 

Based on your understanding of this opt out option, what would you do if given the choice?

I don't think I would opt out becuase, as I said earlier, it makes it easier to get the ball rolling with benefits.

What do you think would change in the steps if you did decide to opt out? What would be harder?

You wwould have to request a COE that takes 30 days, and all that information comes from the COE.

Have you had to request that before?

I just did. I'm waiting on it now.

Is anything held up whikle you're waiting?

Just the 30 days. 

Even if opting out isn't something you'd personally do, how would you go about the process?

I would click through this page and click this green button to opt out.

What would you expect to see after clicking that button?

Probably something that says Your Name, DOD admin number, social, address, the school you'll be attending, short remarks notifying you you're opting out.

I'm going to click on the button, take a second to look at the screen that loaded after clicking that button. How does this compare
to what you expected and how does it change your uderstanding?

It looks like what I thought it would. I like that it reminds you befoe you continue. 

It sounds like this matches what you expected with shifting responsibilties and tasks on your plate versus someone else.

Right, yeah, it does match.

Is there someone at your school to help organize the paperwork?

We have a veterans center, they're just waiting on that COE. 

Let's say you want to contine the opt out process, what action would you take from here?

I would click on the blue button on the bottom left.

How does the content of this screen compare to what you expected to see?

It looks like most VA forms. It looks how I thought it would. 

I'm going to fill this part out as if I were a student. What would you expect to see after clicking the sbumit button?

I didn't think it would end right now, but now I think it might. I'd want to know why they're collecting the data of why 
people are opting out. 

How would you expected to be asked that question?

Maybe a remarks section where you could type a few sentences.

Is this shorter than you expected?

Yes.

Tell me how you'd interpret this information, what's the purpose of this page?

It's letting you know, "Hey it's going to take 1 week or so" and the number to call if you want to opt back in. Then 
briefly telling you again you have to notify your school to give your information if you opt out. 

The part about opting back in, is that how you'd expect to make that happen? Calling the contact center?

Yeah, I don't think there would be a form to opt back in so you'd want to talk to a rep. 

Why don't you think there would be an opt in form to opt back in?

If you've already opted out, for purposes of ensuring that you're opting back in, they'd want you to speak to a representative.

Is there anything else you'd like to share with the team building this form? 

No ma'am.
