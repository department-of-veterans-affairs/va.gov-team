# Conversation Guide for Colmery Act Opt Out usability testing

### Warm-up Questions (Optional) 
Before we dig in on the site, I'd like to ask you a few questions so we get used to talking togther.

> Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work

Currently in school at Milton...studying aerospace, working on getting pilots licenses. Spent 5 years with the Navy doing drug opersations in South America. Currently working at an airline as an aircraft parts purchaser. 

> Have you used the VA for services before? If yes, which? If not, are you considering using VA benefits in the future?

Is currently using benefits for schooling. Hasn't used other VA benefits; primarly education benefits. 

> Have you heard of the Colmery Act, or the Forever GI Bill that got passed recently?

Yes

> What do you know about it?

All I know is supposedly the GI Bill instead of having a 10-year time frame it's an unlimited time frame for the Veteran themself, but other than that that's all I'm aware of. I believe post-9/11 is different from that Which is what I'm under, currently. 

### First Task: Evaluate opt out landing page
Page: https://www.staging.vets.gov/education/opt-out-information-sharing

> What's the purpose of this page?

Looks like this is basically an informational page informing us of what the VA what the Colmery Veteran Education Act is, and also it's giving us the opportunity to opt out of it, if you wanted to.

> Read through the content in this page. What do you understand about the Colmery Act? How would you explain it to a fellow Veteran?

Basically this is VA's way of letting the Veteran know that they may share the information that they get from this to other universities and schools, and if you didn't want information shared, you'd have to come through here and opt out of the information sharing.

> How would you describe the pros and cons of opting out to a fellow Vet?

I guess cons would be, we don't know who exactly who all is going to have the information. we won't know who all will be using it, I would say those are the cons. The pros I would say is...if we didn't want our information out there, or if we wanted our information out there, then basically the schools that have the information can get a hold of us and let us know what they can offer. 

> What would you decide to do? Why?

Um, I'd probably leave it just the way it is. Just because this...it kind of looks like the school can also tell if I have any more benefit left and if I'm done with school or I'm getting close to getting done, so they may not contact me because they know I'm already so close to graduating.

> Let's say you decide you want the VA to stop sharing your information. What step would you take next?

I'd click on the opt-out button at the bottom.

### Second Task: Evaluate "Are you sure?" overlay

> What is the purpose of this screen?

So thi sis basically letting us know if we do opt out that we'll be responsible for filing the paperwork for our education benefits. Lets us know there may be a delay in getting reimbursed, and if we opt out and then later change our mind, what number we can call.



I'd click on the 'yes I want to opt out'

> Read through the content on this page. What is it telling you?

> Why do you think this message exists?

> How has this information affected your understanding of the Colmery Act?

Absolutely, absolutely. It let me know that I would have to do a lot more ground work, as far as making sure I got my education benefits on time and making sure if I transfer shcools I'd have to do all the paperwork on that instead of letting [the school take care of it] I'd have to do that in my own way. I'm probably sure I'd miss a few things, forget a few forms here and there, and have to go through it a couple of times [with the VA office at school]

[up to this point] it's been pretty easy. it's gotten easier and easier as time has gone along...they're having some issues and drawbacks as far as getting information with certain items but for the most part but even though I feel like between the scholl and the regional VA [there could be better communication] but sometimes it's difficult when you have so many different schools...and programs to deal with.

[Direct to continue opting out if they chose otherwise]

### Fill out form

> Before you fill out the form, whose information is the form asking for?

This is asking for my own personal information.

> What do you expect to happen after you click Submit?

Probably some sort of confirmation saying I'd opted out of...

### Confirmation

Take a moment to look at this page.

> What is the purpose of this page?

> Read through the content. How does this information compare with your expectations?

It's more information than I was expecting. Definitely it's all good information. 

You know...the only time I"m actually reading this is if I had that warning at the beginning, that pop-up that said if you opt-out...because I saw that, seeing this would kind of let me know hey! I kind of like the idea, what should I do if I change my mind...I'm glad that you put that towards the top. I think that'd be important. Also knowing after I submit the opt-out form, what I can expect. It's nice to have that too. The fact that it pops up at the top of the stcreen. The fact that you have it bolded really draws the eye to it...

> how would you describe what it's like to opt-out and how you would make the decision to a friend

Based off the information that the pop-up brought up, that would kind of make me not want to opt out. I mean, just going through it...I don't really see any reason why somebody should opt out, unless they're about to run out of edu benefits and htey ahve no reason to have to worry about it again. So I can understand that portion of it. That's where I am now...I'm at the tail end of my benefits, but I still probably wouldnt' opt out in case something else were to pop up.

### Thank-You and Closing 

"So far so good, everything looks very thought out and...the way you have it set up would [make people consider] whether or not they want to opt out, so that's important."
