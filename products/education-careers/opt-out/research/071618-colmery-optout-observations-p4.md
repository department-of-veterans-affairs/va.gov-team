The participant seemed to be very knowledgeable about the processes involved with VA benefits, including education benefits.

Feedback from the participant:
* Participant felt that it should be clear that only the VA representation in the school is receiving their info and not other school employees/factulty/teachers.
* From reading the starting page, it was not clear to the participant that they could share their information with the school themselves.  Participant felt that the the information that is displayed in the modal should be on the first page for clarity
  * Along this same point, in the "Will opting out affect my benefits?" section:  While the answer is technically "no", it should be made clear that opting out will result in more work for the veteran to obtain/use their benefit
* Participant would put the "What's the Colmery Act?" section before the "Opt Out" button.
