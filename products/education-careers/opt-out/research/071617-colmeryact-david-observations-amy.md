### Stood out to me:
- Didn’t want to opt out, didn’t think the information was things that he felt private about.
- Was very decisive. Once he started opting out, wanted to finish, he didn’t want to read about it, he just wanted to complete the process. Felt like the modal with information was redundant. 
- Didn’t want to call the VA for help. Prefered a fully online experience, would have liked an online chat instead. 

### Surprised me:
- As a 40-something, he felt like he grew up with computers and was very comfortable with them
- Didn’t want that much content, wanted big buttons with directions like “Click here to opt back in”
