# Research plan for Rainbows Team work on Colmery Act Opt Out, June 2018

## Goals
1. This document outlines the research for the Colmery Act which goes into effect on August 1, 2018.
2. Background of Colmery Act. [Project readme here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/education-careers/opt-out/README.md), [Kick-off meeting notes here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/education-careers/opt-out/kickoff-meeting-notes.md)
3. Research questions:
    - What do Veterans currently know about what the Colmery Act information sharing requirements?
    - Do Veterans understand the benefits and drawbacks of opting out?
    - Could they accurately explain to a friend what opting out means?
    - Are they able to make an informed decision about opting out?
    - Does the placement of this action within the overall architecture make sense?
    - Are Veterans able to find it?
    - Logged-in Veterans: Are they successfully able to opt out?
    - Logged-out Veterans: Are they successfully able to opt out?
    - Do Veterans understand what actions they need to take if they do not want to opt-out?
4. Research hypothesis:
    - The opt-out of information sharing with schools is a minor part of the Colmery Act, and I don't anticipate many Veterans having detailed knowledge of it. I think the landing page will play a large role in helping a Veteran decide if they want to opt-out or not.
  
## Method
- Remote moderated usability testing with front-end staging environment. This method will allow us to test the content, form flow, interactions, and error states in a realistic environment.
- We'll conduct the research online using GoToMeeting to screenshare and allow mouse and keyboard control.
  
## Participants and Recruitment
1. Participant criteria:
    - We would like to speak with 6-8 Veteran participants representing all branches of the Armed Forces with an even split of men and women, and at least one person in each of the following age brackets: 18-30, 31-50, 50+.
    - All participants must be currently enrolled in college or university using their VA benefits, or must have previously used their VA benefits to attend school.
    - We would like for at least half the participants to have previously created a login to vets.gov that they have used to apply for or access their benefits online. 
    - We would like for at least one participant to have a disability rating of 30% or greater.    
2. Recruitment
    - TBD from Paris and Lauren
    - Idea: Recruit members of the Student Veterans of America group
