# Conversation Guide for Colmery Act Opt Out usability testing

### Warm-up Questions (Optional) 
Before we dig in on the site, I'd like to ask you a few questions so we get used to talking togther.

> Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work)

I live in Mt. Airy, MD, kind of a rural setting. I'm retired, recently from the Service. I spent 22 years in. I'm a retired Army helicopter pilot. My service was of course in Vietnam back in the 1969-70, and I was...shot down about 4 times, wounded a couple times, and I continued to fly different, in the reserves, special forces, for different units. I went to a trade school, and I got some VA benefits when I was going to a trade school to learn how to be an electrician, and I opened my won electircal HVAC business and I ran that for 35 hyears, and since have reitred from that, and right now I developed a new heating/ac system using carbon dioxide as the refrigerant. Very environmentally safe, trying to get funding to manufacture the system. I've been trying to do that for the last 4, 5 years building smaller systems and touting my wares to different inventors around the world. Not much luck yet, but I'm getting close! That's kind of what I do.

I have years ago I applied for VA benefits, having problems from my aircraft crashes and things like that, hearing, PTSD, AO exposure. I was awarded an 80% disability, so that's kind of my story and I'm sticking to it.

> Have you used the VA for services before? If yes, which? If not, are you considering using VA benefits in the future?

I have, through the...back in the early 70s when I was an apprentice electrician making 1.10 an hour [laughing] I thought well, when I was in reservers, people said you know you can get VA benefits for going to school. I went it' snot for college, and they said no for anything! And I applied for it. It wasn't a tremendous amount of money, probably less than 100 a month for two years...I haven't used VA services as far as medical goes. I go to my own physicians and doctors.

> Are you using your Veteran benefits for your education?

Just the rudimentary apprentice school that I attended [see above]. When I enrolled in college later in life, no, I paid for it myself. 

> Have you heard of the Colmery Act, or the Forever GI Bill that got passed recently?

Uh...I've heard about it, I haven't really done a lot of research into it.

### First Task: Evaluate opt out landing page
> What's the purpose of this page?

Well it appears to be a page that will help you navigate to find out whether or not the VA can help you with your tuition and school fees. 

> What actions can you take from this page?

I guess if you go through each tab, I don't know if you click on each tab if it goes into detail; doesnt' look like it except about the Yellow Ribbon program, it looks like you can click on that. That's probably um...you know the from what I have read about and talked to people um the Wounded Warrior program, we've talked to them about hiring some people. They always say that the WWs and the Vetreans have such a problem and they're ery I don't know about shy but unwilling to dig down into information, easily, so perhaps the your tabs here could have a little bit more information, or if you click on them underneath it give you a little more detail about each line [he's using "tabs" to refer to bullet points]...I don't know if clicking on YR would be definitive information about residential hours, percentages...eligibility. The easier you make this for Veterans, especially the people who don't have a very good grasp of the English language or the education to be able to come into a site like this and assess quickly or not so quickly about how to find out how to go about achieving these benefits or finding out the information about them. The easier you make it, the more traffic you'll get on your site. 

> Read through the content in this page. What do you understand about the Colmery Act? How would you explain it to a fellow Veteran?

Well, I mean it's pretty self-explanatory if you read this. It requires you to fill out information about your educational eligibility or benefits with schools, and if information that you care not to share, you can opt-out. And it goes into details about obviously line by line your eligibility your tuition and school fees, the amount of money that you receive from your...with your benefits. I mean, you know, it's pretty straightforward.

> How would you describe the pros and cons of opting out to a fellow Vet?

Well, the information that this site is asking for is not really any information that I would think I would particularly worrya bout sharing with anyone. Obviously it's not asking for SSNs or banking information or things like that, at least in this particular form [no form on screen] but if it does, you have the option to opt out of that particular detail tha you don't' want to share. The whole purpose of the VA and the Vetreans is sharing this informatin so that it makes it easier for other Veterans to be able to acquire the ability and of course get the VA to help them enhance their education so they can provide for themselves and their families.

> What would you decide to do?

Oh, I'd definitely opt in. If they're going to help provide assistance to pay for school, absolutely I'd do that. I'm not quite sure why anyone would say no to this if you're interested in the VA paying for or helping you with your tuition or your school fees, then you gotta you have to opt in to the program for them to provide assistance to you.

> what would happen to benefits if someone opted out?

It says it doesn't affect your benefits [locates text on screen]. I don't know. Perhaps...I mean it says obviously that your education benefits will stay the same if you decide to opt-out, but I find that a little hard to believe that if you don't want to give them information, how are they going to pay for...x amount of dollars for school tuition. I don't know which part of the forms you would opt out for. I don't quite...if someone's interested with the VA helping, I'm not sure why they would opt out of anything.

> What would the impact be?

If you believe what the form says, you're not going to lose any benefits. I still find that a little hard to believe. If you're not going to participate in the program, why would they want to help you do anything. That's a little...I don't know why anybody would want to opt out of these 8 or 9 questions that you have, 7 questions, that none of them are very evasive [invasive?] to your privacy. You're in front of that school.

> Do you think privacy would be one of the main reasons people would opt out

I would think. I can't really imgaine why they'd want ot opt out of hte questions that are defined under the information the VA shares. They all look like they're pretty benign questions to me.

> Let's say you decide you want the VA to stop sharing your information. What step would you take next?

Well, you mean, I would opt out of all these different questions. I'm not quite sure how you would...I guess what it says, you click on your opt-out button and I guess it takes you to another site and [choose] what you want to opt out of.

### Second Task: Evaluate "Are you sure?" overlay

Take a moment to look at this screen.

> What is the purpose of this screen?

Gives you a little explanation of what you're trying to do. And it still says you have to provide the schools benefits paperwork.

> does that change your understanding of the information sharing at all?

Not really. That last line there, there may be a delay in getting [reimbursed] so perhaps that would put somoene a little more...they'd have to maybe think about doing that. Maye I don't want to opt out, maybe I don't care if they get this information if it's going to speed up my reimbursement for school expenses. But if you're not worried about that, you'd go, yeah, I want to opt out.

### Fill out form

> Before you fill out the form, whose information is the form asking for?

You have to put your name and you have to list your SSN unless you don't have one. I guess you just fill out the form and click 'submit application.'

> What do you expect to happen after you click Submit?

Well, I don't know [laughing]. It doesn't really tell you what happens after you submit that. Yeah, there's not really any ...huh. 

> Go ahead and fill out these fields, but you don't have to enter your real information.

### Confirmation

Take a moment to look at this page.

> What is the purpose of this page?

It pretty much tells you exactly what's going to happen. That you'll receive some information in the mail, and it takes them about two days to remove your the information from the schools, and then if you don't want to opt out, call the number and I guess opt back in...they'll give you a confirmatin number. Down below, help number again. Pretty self-explanatory.

> Let's say you have a meeting with your school administration coming up to review your fall schedule. How would you prepare your paperwork to bring with you?

My first check register from the sixties...so I have all my tax forms...it was never a problem for me filling out VA forms. We actually when I was in business I applied for a VA loan and received that also. Small business administration. Wasn't really a VA loan. So paperwork is my fort√© since my PhD is in business administration...I don't really have any problems with paperwork. But in the reading I've done [about veterans] it seems like that'd be a pretty big hurdle for a lot of people....people just don't save information anymore. Seems like they're not very organized in their life. 

### Thank-You and Closing 

Kind of interesting that people want to opt-out. That's the thing that just kind of...I'm incredulous that people would want to opt out of trying to get VA benefits. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but I guess obviously they do if you have a form like this. There seems to be a need for it. Have you experienced that? Do people actually say they wouldn't want to give out any information to the VA?

Doesn't have a preference for which gift. Follow up through e-mail.
