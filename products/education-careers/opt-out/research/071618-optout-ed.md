#### Have you engaged with the VA?

- Has used Voc Rehab & finished a degree & starting masters in Fall at Belmont
- Involved with the Warriors Scholar Project - Ivy leagues have recognized the importance of serving these underrepresented minority
    - Costs nothing for people to go & last cohort people in the STEM process were learning from Nobel prize winners

#### Are you familiar with the GIBIll?
- No, hasn’t had experience


#### What is the purpose of the first page?
- Benefits percentage was the first thing he saw before the page fold
- Difference in distance hours between GIBill and Voc Rehab, can take Voc Rehab all online
    - This effects how he would use his benefits. Thought there was a location requirement with Voc rehab
- Doesn’t think the VA should show the Benefits percentage?
    - He asked, ‘Are they sharing it with the schools?’
    - The school is only entitled to know if they are getting paid
    - There should be some understanding that your teacher can’t access your personal information
        - ‘School means teachers, janitors, etc.’
    - If you don’t give information to the school, he believes that the school will disqualify them. You have to share this information, if you don’t share the information then he believes the school can’t accept the benefits/pay your tuition
- The school itself shouldn’t get this information, he thinks the school should only know that the VA is going to be paying the tuition
- He feels that Opting Out would cause problems

#### If you wanted to opt out, what would you do?
- Hit the Opt Out button
- Learn more about the Colmery Act first. Thinks that information should go before the button and even before.
- Thinks the Colmery information should be between header and first question
- He knows that the information needs to get to the school regardless. Whether the VA shares it or where the user has to share the information.

#### How does the Opt Out Modal effect your understanding of opting out?
- He thinks the green button was the ‘OFFICIAL’ opt out button
- Confusing that there is a second step in the modal
- It WILL effect the way you receive benefits, because it delays how long it takes for the schools to get your information and your will have to manually provide it to them
