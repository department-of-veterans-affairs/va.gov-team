# Conversation Guide for Colmery Act Opt Out usability testing

### Warm-up Questions (Optional) 

at school on her lunch break!! 

> Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work)

I currently reside in Nashville, TN. This is my second go-around. My first go-around with school I...got my bachelor's in criminal justice, and now that I'm in schol again I'm studying aircraft maintenance. It's pretty cool, I enjoy it. I was in the Air Force for six years. My experience it was different. It helped me grow up in a lot of aspects...learned a lot, go tot travel and meet a lot of influential people in my life. I'm grateful I got to be a part...of the Air Force.

It's a technical college, we go in trimesters. This is my first trimester, after this [one] it'll be about 4 more. It gest you ready, you put in your hours to wrok towards your licesne to test out, so you can get your airframe and power plant license so you can go and be certified with the FAA.

> Have you used the VA for services before? If yes, which? If not, are you considering using VA benefits in the future?

I have! I use...the Montgomery GI Bill, and this time I'm using the Post-9/11. 

> Have you heard of the Colmery Act, or the Forever GI Bill that got passed recently?

Yes, I heard about that, wtih Trump saying something about there's no cap or limit of time. Before I had about 15 years to use it and now I don't have to...they've added a few things in [about adding benefits or disability rating]. I heard about it a while ago; I was wondering what happened to it. Is it still approved...is it going into effect.

### First Task: Evaluate opt out landing page
Page: https://www.staging.vets.gov/education/opt-out-information-sharing

Take a moment to look around this page, and use the amount of time you normally would when visiting a web page for the first time.

> What's the purpose of this page?

So the first part...is just basic information. This is informing me of what you all are going to verify with the school on my behalf. And also if you...explaining what it is, why it exists...I'm grateful for this; I didn't know if I was going to use it or not and if time was on my side.

> Read through the content in this page. What do you understand about the Colmery Act? How would you explain it to a fellow Veteran?

> How would you describe the pros and cons of opting out to a fellow Vet?

I couldn't see why anybody would opt out, because what if you have a kid, or ...if you have a kid later in life and they have that cap on it where it's like 15 years, and you're at year 10? they wouldn't even have the chance to transfer it to that child. Ic an't see why they would want to opt out...it's helpful and beneficial. If you're not going to use it give someone else a chance to use it....

I would let them know that you won't lose your benefits, but you have a cap on it...they're going to ask you waht other stuff woudl you like to take. I would explain what the Colmery Act is and why it's beneficial and why you should take advantage of [it]...so [you hae options]. I think it's just a time-sensitive thing.

> What would you decide to do?

In my mind at first it was a use it or lose it type deal. So that's why I kind of got thte ball rolling as well. After I had a child I didn't know what I was going to do next. I had my bachelor's but I wanted to transition...and make sure I have enough time to do it. I'm glad this is in effect even though I'm using it now, what if I didn't want to use it for anohter 5 years or so, i could be in a situation where I have to come out of pocket to pay for schooling.

> Let's say you decide you want the VA to stop sharing your information. What step would you take next?

I know whenever I was doing it at first...the VA sent me some papers saying that I can divert it into a Montgomery GI Bill again, but it would be a lesser percentage. I wouldn't lose it but it would divert things in a different direction. [it being education benefits] So that's what I would explain to someone else in that current situation.

I know for starters you can go to the website and then you can use...let's see here...you can go to manage your health & benefits and you can submit like an email type thing or a ticket to the VA telling them what you want to do. They're pretty quick about respondign back when you do it that way. Or you can call them. Submit your information and wht you're trying to do would be the easiest way. I've done that before and they're fairly quick [about responding]. Or you can go to VA or talk to an edu rep; I know a lot of people like to go in person.

> WHat's your experience been like when you have to go in or call?

The calling part...the wait time is atrocious. I know it's normally when people get paid at the beginning of the month, that's when the...wait time is between 20 and 30 minutes. That's the part that gets me. When I actually get into...I had a situation where I wasn't getting my benefits for six weeks; I didn't have books; I had to constantly call them...it was a young man who...pushed it through...so now I have another situation where I got married and I sent in my marriage license [and they never got it and communication was a mess and she had to keep chasing it.]

When it comes to veterans...a lot of people who work for the VA are not veterans and they dont' understand how time-sensitive things can be. There are people who do feel for you and will work for you...it's like pulling teeth with them. It's so frustrating.

I try [to use the website]...I went on the site and [looked for a form but the rep gave her the wrong form number]. I do like to use the website to cut down on having to call in. I've done it before when I requested an eligibility form; I did it through the website and they sent it to me and I had no issue.

I think maybe some of the reps are a little misinformed, and I think you shuld be prepared for the questions I'm going to ask you. Forms are a big deal. To cut down on the wait time you should send people to the website [but in the meantime] I'll just keep calling in.

[ brought back on track ]

I see this green button that says "opt out". [ Would expect to see a consent page, how opting out affects her pro/con, something to sign and verify, getting a confirmation page and send it to her email to make sure she got it and it's confirmed ]

[Direct to continue opting out if they chose otherwise]

### Second Task: Evaluate "Are you sure?" overlay

Take a moment to look at this screen.

> What is the purpose of this screen?

> Read through the content on this page. What is it telling you?

Wow, so pretty much if you opt out it leaves all the responsibility all the leg work of you having to do it, versus the VA doing it on your behalf. And it already takes a while for things to get rolling...so if you have to do all the leg work, good luck. The good thing is if you opt out now you can opt back in later...no penalty. But I don't know why anyone would opt out...doing it yourself would cause a further delay.

> What do you imagine the delay woudl be like?

Oh my god! It could possibly be 2+ months. It took me about six weeks, so it could take even longer when you're submitting the information. It already takes a long time and patience, but if you do it a long way...you might be done with your first semester of school before you get anything.

The financial impact - your bills doesn't stop, I have a small child, I'm married, I have daycare...it's just a number of things when you're waiting 4 months, that puts a financial bind on your significant other...it's just a domino effect that happens when you have to wait financially on things. So when you have to do it the long way...you're putting not only yourself but others in a bad situation.

[would remain opted in!]

- thinks the next page will have the same info as the modal, plus a confirmation number "in the event you change your mind, you can refer to it"
- Click the 'yes' button to continue 

### Fill out form

> Before you fill out the form, whose information is the form asking for?

Put your information in the [form]. It's pretty simple and self-explanatory. It's not a hard thing to do this. I like the vets.gov because when you go on a normal edu benefits website it seems different from this. I actually like this a lot better because you can access...health documents and things like that. It's a one-stop shop. 

> What do you expect to happen after you click Submit?

I keep thinking I'm going to see the verification page! I'm sure those slots would be prefilled if you were logged in. Once you submit the page, a verification page. It might ask you 'are you sure' again.

### Confirmation

> What is the purpose of this page?

Letting you know you opted out and that it has been submitted. you'll be sent a confirmation letter and also too it'll be sent to the school. and then if you change your mind you can call this number to reverse the situation. And this also informs you that if you opt out...that _you_ need to give [information] to the school.

That little verification or confirmation page, there it is. Giving you that just to let you know it's been confirmed, it's been submitted.

> Read through the content. How does this information compare with your expectations?

I guess it's completely different, as far as the verification thing. It's going in a little bit more detail about what you've done, what's next, and it affects everything as far as schooling and the things that will happen on your end. It's self explanatory; that's the part that I like. It actually explains everything in detail.

### Thank-You and Closing 

"I enjoyed this, because I actually made an account on vets.gov and I was looking at it and looking around. I'm glad I was able to do this."

That's the way of the world, where it's going -- eveyrthing is pretty much technology-based.

Amazon please!
