**[Missed beginning of intro]**

…Years ago I applied for VA benefits… for agent orange exposure, I was awarded 80% disability. That’s my story and I’m sticking to it.

**So you’ve used veteran services before?**

I have. Back in the early 70s when I was an apprentice making $1.10 an hour, I thought, “well… you can get VA benefits for going to school.” So I applied for them and it wasn’t a tremendous amount of money, probably less than $100 a month for less than 2 years, but I haven’t used VA services as far as medical goes. I go to my own physicians and doctors.

**Did you use it for any education benefits?**

Just the rudimentary apprentice school that I attended. When I enrolled in college later in life I paid for it myself.

**Have you heard of the Colmery Act or Forever GI bill that was recently passed?**

I’ve heard about it but haven’t done a lot of research into it.

**Take a moment to look around this page and talk me through what you view as the purpose of this page.**

It appears to be a page that will help you navigate to a page where you can find out if the VA will help you with your tuition and school fees.

**What actions can you take from here? (me personally?) No, any veteran.**

I guess if you get through each tab or if you click into each tab and get more detail. It doesn’t look like it except for the Yellow Ribbon program. 

Ya know, from what I’ve read about and talked to people about the Wounded Warrior program, they always say that the WW and veterans have such a problem and are very shy or unwilling to dig down into information easily. So, perhaps your tabs here could have more information or if you click on them underneath it, it could give you more detail on each line. Idk whether clicking on the Yellow Ribbon Program does that… eligibility, etc. The easier you make this for veterans, especially the people who don’t have a very good grasp and who don’t have a good grasp of the English language or the education to come into a site like this to assess quickly or not so quickly about achieving these benefits… the easier you make it, the more traffic you’ll get. 

**Why don’t you take another couple of minutes and read through the content of the page, and as you read it, tell me about your understanding of the Colmery Act is, and if your understanding of it changes as you read through this here.**

[Quiet as participant reads]

It’s pretty self-explanatory if you read this. It requires you fill out information about your education and eligibility. And information you care not to share, you can opt out. And it goes into details about your eligibility, your tuition and school fees, the amount of money you received with your benefits. I mean, ya know, it’s pretty straight forward.

**In your opinion, what are the pros and cons of sharing this info with schools?**

Well, the information that this site is asking for is not really any information that I would think I would particularly worry about sharing with anyone. It’s not asking for SSN or banking info or things like that, at least in this particular form. If it does, you have the option to opt out of that particular detail you don’t want to share. The whole purpose of the VA and the veterans is that sharing this information makes it easier for other veterans to acquire the ability and of course get the VA to help them enhance their education so they can provide for themselves and their families.

**So if you were to imagine a scenario where you were to go back to school and you had the GI bill available to pay for your education, what decisions would you make about allowing the VA to share this information with schools. Would you opt out or in?**

I would definitely opt in if they are going to provide assistance to pay for school. I’m not sure why anyone would say no to this if you’re interested in the VA helping you with your tuition an school fees, the you have to opt into the program.

**What do you think would happen to benefits if someone opts out?**

It says it doesn’t affect your benefits. Idk, perhaps… I mean, it says your educational benefits would stay the same if you decide to opt out. I find it a little hard that if you don’t give information… I don’t know which part of the forms you’d opt out for. If someone is interested in the VA helping, I’m not sure why someone would opt out.

**If you don’t lose benefits, what is the impact?**

If you believe what the form says, you’re not going to lose any benefits, but I find that hard to believe. If you’re not going to participate in the program, why would they want to help you do anything? Idk why anyone would want to opt out of 8 or 9… 7… questions you have. None of them look very evasive to your privacy. I mean, you’re just talking about schools.

**Do you think privacy would be the main reason someone opts out?**

I would think. I can’t imagine why someone would want to opt out of the questions that are defined under the information that’s shared. They all look like pretty benign questions to me.

**OK, if you did want to opt out. Let’s say you made that decision and made that decision to keep your information private, what action would you take from this screen?**

You mean I’d opt out of all these different questions? I’m not quite sure… I guess what it says is you click on the Opt-Out button, and it takes you another site and you can decide what you want to opt out of,

**Why don’t you take that step?**

[Clicks button]

**Is this what you expected to see when you clicked the green opt out button?**

Yeah, it gives you an explanation of what you’re ready to do.

**Does this change your understanding of the information sharing at all?**

No, not really. And in that last line there may be a delay in getting reimbursement for school related expenses. Maybe idk, if it’s going to speed up my reimbursement for school expenses. But if you’re not worried about that you can opt out.

[Clicks button]

**So on this screen, take what action you imagine you would take to continue opting out.**

Well, let’s see, you have to put your name and list your SSN unless you don’t have one. I guess you would just fill out the form and click Submit Application.

**What would you see after clicking Submit?**

Well Idk, it doesn’t tell you what happens after you click that. Yeah, there’s not really any… huh.

**Well, why don’t you go ahead and fill out the form. Don’t use your real info.**

[Fills out form and clicks submit]

**So, looking at this screen, take a look at the info presented here. Tell me what the purpose of this page is.**

Well pretty much that tells you exactly what’s going to happen, that you’ll receive some info in the mail and that it’ll take them some time to remove the information from the schools. And it explains to you that you still have to provide some information to the school. And it gives you a confirmation number and the help number again. It’s pretty self-explanatory.

**So if you had opted out and you were a student that had a meeting coming up with your school registrar, what is that process like to provide paper work to school? How would you go about doing that?**

For me, it’s extremely easy. I’m very organized and I always keep registered. I have my first check register from the 60s, so it was never a problem for me to fill out VA forms. When I was in business I applied for VA loans… SBA loan not really a VA loan. Paperwork is my forte, so I don’t really have a problem with paper work.

But, in reading all the things I’ve read about veterans, it seems like it would be a pretty big hurdle for most people. People don’t save information anymore and they aren’t very organized in their life. 

**Well, that wraps up the question I have. DO you have any questions or input for me?**

No, not really. It’s kind of interesting that people want to opt out. That’s the thing that just kind of incredulous about. I don’t get why people would opt out of VA benefits, but obviously they do if you have a form like this. Have you experienced that, that people wouldn’t want to give out information to the VA?
