### Introduction
Thank you for joining us today. My name is Emily, and I'm joined on the line by some colleagues who are observing the session and helping me take notes. We are doing this feedback session on behalf of the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs to learn how to make one section of our website more useful to you.

Before we start, there are a few things I'd like to mention:

We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.

We are not testing your ability, and there are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the application and meet Veterans' needs.

I won’t be offended by any opinions you express, nor will anyone else present.

This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question.

I’ll be recording the audio and screen as we talk today, so that we capture your opinions accurately. We will not be using video.

If for any reason at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?

Great! Any questions before we get started?

///

Okay. I'm going to turn on screen and audio recording now.

[The moderator will begin audio and screen recording.]

### Warm-up Questions (Optional) 
Before we dig in on the site, I'd like to ask you a few questions so we get used to talking togther.

Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work)

Have you used the VA for services before? If yes, which? If not, are you considering using VA benefits in the future?

Are you currently enrolled in school?

What are you studying?

Are you using your Veteran benefits for your education?

Have you heard of the Colmery Act, or the Forever GI Bill that got passed recently?

What do you know about it?

Extras:

Have you ever had a good experience with the VA? What made that a positive experience in your mind? If not, what would make a good experience?

What kinds of communication do you currently receive from the VA?


Now I'm going to share my screen with you. You'll see a page on Vets.gov.

### Thank-You and Closing
