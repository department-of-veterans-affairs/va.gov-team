I'll start by me asking you a few questions.
Let's start by you telling me about yourself, where live, what you do, what branch of the military were you in.

> I live in houston.  I do IT support for a gas company.  I served in marine corp.  I like to do a lot of outdoor stuff with my family and kids.

Have you used VA services before?
> Yes


Have you used VA benefits for education?
> Yes, I got my degree with GI bill.


What did you study?
> Digital forensics.


Have you heard of the Colmery Act or the GI bill that was recently passed?
> No

Take your time, look around here, like you would do normally.  When you're ready, let me know what you think the purpose of this page is.
> You can opt out of them sharing whatever information about your education benefits.


How would you describe pros or cons of opting out?
> Pros are for people who want their information kept to themselves.  I can't tell if it's for prospective schools or what, but controls what information the schools get about them.
> Cons are...not sure. 
> Seems pretty basic.


If you were going to school, what would you choose to do?
> I would not opt out.  I would allow them to receive the information because I know that can speed up the process.


Have you had experiences that were slow because of needing information?
> Yeah, getting security clearance. Tracking down all the right information can cause processes to slow down dramatically.

So lets say you did want to opt out.  This is a prototype of the form.  What action would you take if you wanted to opt out?
> I'd click on the button and fill out the form.

OK, why don't you go ahead and click the button

[*popup shows*]

Would any of the info in that screen affect your decision to opt out?
> Yes, because it puts the burden of getting my infomation to the school on me.  Usually there is someone that asissts with that, but now that is my responsibility.  That would be enough to make me not want to opt out because I have enough on my plate.  If it's someone's job, they know where to get it whereas I will have to do research to figure out where to get it.

Based on what you've seen so far, do you know how you'd go about opting back in?
> Uh, I'd have to call the number.  I'm not exactly sure.  I'd have to look into it.

Why don't you continue as if you wanted to optout.  What would you do next?
> I'd fill out my information and click submit.

What do you think you'd see after submitting the form?
> Probably a verification page to make sure my info is correct, then followed by a final page reminding me that I'm now responsibe for my education information

[*fills out form*]

OK, so take a moment to take a look and tell me what you make of this page and how it compares with what you expected to see.
> Well it does warn me that it doesn't verify my information.  I could have made a typo.  It does tell me if I change my mind I can call this number, and tells me what to do.  If I entered my social security number wrong I probably wouldn't be totally opted out.

Let's say you've completed the form, you are in school, and you need to meet with the registrar.  How would you go about gathering the info you need?
> I'd probably have to call them to find out what information they need.  I'd probably have to do research to find out where I can get that info.

What's that process of gathering your own data/documentation?
> Well, I hadn't opted out, so the school did it.  So honestly, if I opted out I'd have to do research to find out how to get the information for the school.

[*Emily wraps it up*]

Any other feedback for us?
> No.  I don't think this is something that I would have opted out on, but I see how other people consider their privacy important.
