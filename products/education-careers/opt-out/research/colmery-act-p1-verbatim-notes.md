(Emily) Let's go through some warm up questions before we get started. Where do you live, what branch of service were you in, what do you do now?

(P1) I live in Colmie (sp?) Ohio, I'm currently unemployed. I served in the Navy and then was an Army recruiter for a couple of years after. 

Did you use the GI Bill to go to school?

Yes, I got two associates degrees. One in general studies and another in nursing.

Have you heard of the Colmery Act, also known as the Forever GI Bill? 

I hadn't heard of it, but I looked it up when I saw it was the subject of this webinar. It's pretty exciting there's a forever GI Bill. I had just ten years to use mine. I felt I needed to get a bachelors but wasn't able to afford it. 

How much time between degrees?

I started my degree in the military with a university (name?). I transferred my nursing degree to another school and got my nursing degree in 2000. 

I'm going to navigate to Vets.gov. Take a look at this page, use the time you normally take to look at a web page for the first time. Take a look around.
Talk me through what's going through your mind as you're looking around. 

I'm just thinking if there's a new program, do I qualify. This seems slow because we're on GoToMeeting. I can't do anything. I want a drop down, but I don't have one. 
I don't know why anyone would design something like this. It's horrible. I want a list when I hover. This is not helpful. I want to go away from this because it's not 
working how I want it to. 

Tell me what you think the purpose of this page is. 

I know what opt out is. It's saying I don't want to participate. lets see, they're going to share with organizations unless I say no.

What do you think the benefit of opting out would be?

It's privacy, if I don't want this info shared with me then I would opt out. I don't care, this is innocuous info. I don't know what the Yellow Ribbon Program is.
If I don't know what it is, I'm pribably not in it. 

How would you describe this prgoarm to a fellow veteran? 

I would say, if you don't want them sharing these things, then opt out. If not, don't worry about it. 

You mentioned you wouldn't mind the schools having this info. 

No, even if I was interested in education, this information would be helpful for them to know. 

What action would you take if you did want to opt out?

I'd just click on this green button here. I'm not going to read that. That's probably important information, but it's redundant. 

Before you fill anything in, what would you expect to see next?

A confirmation screen of what I entered. Basically, everything I put in if I did fill it in. 

This is not a real form. You don't have to put your social security number. 

I would submit accept, and then, it didn't ask me, but I would expect there would be a confirmation screen as opposed to taking me to a "hey, you're done."
If it's going to be valid data shared with an educational organization, I believe the member should have an opportunity to validate it before submitting. 

If you changed your mind and wanted to opt back in, how would you do that?

I guess I would call these help numbers, it doesn't look like there's an easy way to opt in by clicking. It's unlikely I'd want to change my mind. 
It doesn't jump out at me, maybe I made a mistake. There's no obvious way that says, "click here to opt in." 

What would you expect to happen if you called the help desk number?

I don't like those (help desk numbers) if it's like the VA, it takes forever to get anyone. By the time you wait around and talk to someone, it 
seems like a waste of time. I just assume the amount of time I'd wait to talk to an actual person isn't worth it. An online chat seems like they'd 
be with you in 3 minutes or something. It's more of an immediate response.  

So, you'd be more willing to engage with online chat before the help desk?

Oh yeah, I'm 46, I've grown up wth computers. There's a more rapid engagement. I'll click a tool with pre-programmed stuff that says, "Hi David." I don't like 
to feel I'm sitting in some phone queue and no one knows I'm there. 

Let's say you opted out, see this screen confirming you've opted out. If you had a meeting with the registrar and they didn't already have your information, how would you go about
providing this informton if they didn't automatically receive it. 

(P1 laughs) They seemed pretty good at figuring that out. They seemed very motivated to get what they needed to get paid. I know they figured
it out. I'm completely confident the school will find out how they need to get paid. 

That wraps up the screens for today, anything else you'd like to share?

One of these I did, there was a hidden motive. Is there anything like that here? I asked about some functionality and they said that's what
we're really testing today. In the other one, I was surprised I found out what they were really testing. This one seems more straight forward. 

Your feedback is really helpful.
