### Stood out to me:
- Modal helped him understand how much more work for him it would be to opt out
- More information than he was expecting for the confirmation screen, but thought it was all good information and well organized
- overall thought the information was well thought out and to the point. 

### Surprised me:
- He said he would miss things if he had opted out and had to do things manually himself.
- trused the VA to handle his information and would not opt out.
