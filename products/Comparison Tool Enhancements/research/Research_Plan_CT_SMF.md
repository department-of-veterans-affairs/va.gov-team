# Research Plan for gcio-vfep (SMF feature enhancement)
<!--
*Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the #research-ops Slack channel.* 
-->
## Background
This research covers the proposed redesign and enhancement of the "Specialized mission filter" feature (SMF) in the VA's GI Bill Comparison Tool (CT) product. A usability study will be organized to gauge the updated feature's ease of use and overall value to the user. Enhancements include:
- The ability to select multiple SMF options
- Descriptions of SMF options
- Positioning of all filters below the Comparison Tool's search panel

The CT product is publicly available (accessible whether or not the Veteran is signed in to VA.gov). It is not a new product, though modifications to it may occur from time to time to enhance the user experience.
<!--- Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)
- What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?-->

### OCTO Priorities 
This research supports and aligns with the OCTO priority goal of enhancing Veterans’ personalized online experience.

[OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md)

### Veteran Journey
The filtering feature to be studied is part of the GI Bill Comparison Tool, which provides information and guidance toward educational and training opportunities for Veterans.

For many Veterans, this can be an important step in the "Starting Up," "Reinventing Myself," and "Engaging VA to access benefits and services" segments of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf).
<!--Are there moments that matter?-->

## Research Goals	
The primary goal of this research is to confirm ease of use and gauge the level of understanding of how the Specialized mission filters can be applied and updated in the GI Bill Comparison Tool.

<!--What are you trying to learn from this research? 

*Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.*-->

<!--### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?-->

### Research questions
Questions we seek to resolve by observing how participants use the SMF feature include:
- How filtering options are understood: Do participants seek additional information on selections by locating and opening the "Learn more" accordion control to expose descriptions of the filters? 
- How are the filters selected when using the GI Bill Comparison Tool: Do participants choose a single filter or (as now supported) select multiple filters?
- Are participants aware that they need to choose the Update results button to refresh results?
- Are participants satisfied with the updated results?
- Are participants aware that they can modify the filters and update results at any time?
- Do participants have any questions about other available filters or filter groups?
- Are sight-impaired or other participants with accessibility needs in any way hampered from using and modifying filters?

<!--FOR CONVERSATION GUIDE:
- Have you previously used the SMF feature to filter school search results in the GI Bill Comparison tool? If so,
  - Did you apply the feature on a desktop or mobile device?
  - Which SMF filter or filter options have you applied?
  - Were you satisfied with the results of the SMF feature?
  - Please rank the ease of use and value of the SMF feature on a scale of 1-10 -->

<!--Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:
- What will I do with what I learn from this question?
- Does this question serve the goals of my study?
- Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md)
--> 

### Hypothesis
This study is intended to provide insight into whether or not CT filters, in particular those included in the SMF, are being used as designed and are providing Veterans with an effective, efficient means of discovering the opportunities they seek.

Notes and recordings will be collected and analyzed, and the study will be considered successful if no serious impediments are discovered as participants work through the primary feature being studied, the feature functions as expected, and no design changes are deemed necessary.

<!--
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!
-->

## Methodology	
This research will be a moderated usability study focusing on the specialized media filter feature in the GI Bill Comparison Tool web application.

Each session will include note-taking and, with the permission of the participant, recording, to determine how participants use and apply the filtering features under study.

<!--
Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design.

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of participants. 
 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
The intended audience should comprise Veterans who are currently or may in future be seeking educational or employment training opportunities.

Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

<!--
Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 

Pro tip:
- For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants. 
- Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more.

### Recruitment criteria
Total number of Veteran participants: 10-15 max.

Demographic criteria: Veterans, preferably those who are actively seeking or will in future be seeking education or training opportunities and may want to review institutions that support selected specialized mission types listed in the filter.

Current specialized mission institution types are:
- Historically Black colleges and universities
- Men-only
- Women-only
- Religious affiliation
- Hispanic-serving institutions
- Native American-serving institutions
- Alaska Native-serving institutions
- Asian American Native American Pacific Islander-serving institutions
- Predominantly Black institutions
- Tribal college and university

Special needs criteria: Recommend 2-4 participants be included in the study to ensure design and content is accessible to Veterans with sight, hearing, or other impairments.   

<!--
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 
-->

## Timeline
Research review artifacts, including design materials and this Research Plan, will be submitted to Perigean within two days of the SMF feature's deployment on the staging server.
<!--
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.
