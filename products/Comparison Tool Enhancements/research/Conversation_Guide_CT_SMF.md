## Intro - 5 minutes

<b> Moderator only </b>
Thanks for joining us today. My name is [name]. I'll be your moderator for this session, and my colleague [name] will be observing and taking notes. Other colleagues may be in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes as we work through the session.

The subject of this study is filtering options and capabilities--specifically, the Specialized Mission Filters--that are available in the GI Bill Comparison Tool. We'd like you to try the filters to see how they're applied to educational institution searches, and let us know if you think they'll be useful to you.

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** 
- I want to be sure not to keep you much longer than that.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** 
- The sole purpose of this study is to improve the tools to better match Veteran's needs. We will not be offended by any opinions you express, and welcome any feedback you may have.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.** 
  - ## Things to say if participant wants to stop/pause the session:
    - <i>"Please know that your comfort is important to us, and we're here to ensure you feel at ease."</i>
    - <i>"Would you like me to stop recording?"</i>
    - <i>"I understand that these things can be overwhelming. Would you like to take a short break or stop?"</i>
    - <i>"I sense that this may be overwhelming. We sincerely value what you are sharing with us, but you do not have to share anything that you are not comfortable with."</i>
    - <i>"Would you like to reschedule our session, or stop all together?"</i>
    - <i>"I understand if this seems overwhelming. If you would like to take a few minutes to sit in silence and recollect, that is totally fine."</i>

  ## Resuming after a break (if taken)
  - <i> "I would be happy to hear more about [topic of conversation]. Are you okay with sharing more, or would you like to move on to the next topic?" </i>
    
  
**Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
  - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask other observers to leave the call. - If yes: Admit observers. 
    Then ask the note-taker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, such as their first name and position with VA.gov. 
  - Once complete, ask note-taker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth.

**Are you okay with my recording the screen activities and audio as we talk today?** 
  - *If yes:* **Once I start recording, I'll confirm once more that you are ok with me recording this session.**
  - *Start recording.*
  - *If no:* <i> "Do you mind if I save the transcript of our session?" </i>
  <b> Transcripts </b>
  - Click 'Live Transcript' > Enable/Show Captions 
  - Click 'Live Transcript' > View Full Transcript

- **I have started the recording** 
- <i>"I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record screen activities and audio as we talk today?" </i>

## Warm-up Questions - 3 minutes

<i> "Before we look at the GI Bill Comparison Tool and its filtering capabilities, I would like to start by asking you a couple questions..."</i>

1. I understand that you've shown interest in or have been exploring educational opportunities. Is that correct?
  - Thank you for confirming that.

2. What type of device are you using today?
  - Desktop, laptop, mobile

3. Have you used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before?
  - If "yes": 
    - <i>"What/when did you use it for?"</i> 
    - <i>"How did you find your experience while using the tool?"</i> 

  - If "no": 
    - <i>"That's okay if you haven't used it before! By the end of today, we aim to make you feel comfortable with it, and hopefully, you'll find it useful and want to use it again in the future."</i>

4. We have a link to a design that we'd like you to test. How would you prefer to access it: via Zoom's chat or by having it read aloud to you?
  - If participant asks for link, share via Zoom chat: https://staging.va.gov/education/gi-bill-comparison-tool 
  - Refer to "screen sharing instructions" if needed.

## User Tasks
- Moderator's reminder: Maintain an ongoing practice of asking follow-up questions to each participant. 
  * If they discover something beneficial, you can ask:     
    <i>"Could you please share why or how you found this helpful?"</i>
<br>
<i>"Now, I'd like to have you try out a few things..."</i>
* Make sure the participant looks or seems comfortable to move forward

### Screen Sharing
<i>"I'd appreciate it if you could share your screen with me during this session so I can follow along with what you're doing. Before we begin, just a friendly heads-up: screen sharing will display exactly what's on your screen. So, if there's anything you'd like to keep private, feel free to close any apps or turn off notifications you'd rather not share. No rush, take your time!"</i>
  - See <i>Screen Sharing Instructions</i> if needed

### Task #1: [Initial search]
<i>"Picture yourself casually exploring institutions to attend or just satisfying your curiosity about available options. Search for an institution or program that piques your interest or curiosity. Ready to dive in?"</i>

  - 1. <i>"If you were interested in finding a program or institution to attend, what's the first step you'd take?"</i>
  - <i>"I would like to hear your thoughts as you go through this process. Say whatever you are thinking, what you are doing, and feel free to share what you're unsure about."</i>
    - Make notes of their process - what they are doing and saying.

  - 2. Here are questions for when the participant inputs their search criteria and you want them to notice the school card results:
    - <i>"What is this information telling you?"</i>
    - <i>"Did you see how to do that?"</i>


### Task #2: [Refine search]
"<i>Now that you've completed your initial search, let's dive a bit deeper. Think about your specific interests and goals you have in mind for your educational opportunities you're seeking or curious about. Afterward, let's use the comparison tool's filtering features to refine your options and find programs that match your preferences. As you make your selections, please share your reasons behind these choices. This is all about tailoring the search to your liking, so take your time and feel free to explore!"</i>

  - 1. Listen/watch how the participant navigates through the filters
  - 2. Document comments made about 'apply filters'/ 'clear results' and 'search' buttons
  
  - Prompting (if needed):
    - 'Search' button : changed search parameter
    - 'Apply filters': changed anything at all in the filters
    - 'Clear filters': starts from scratch, clears everything except the search parameter
    - Refreshing screen: reapplies filters before they were cleared


### Task #3: [Accordion component - definitions]
<i>"Imagine you want to explore specialized mission types within the GI Bill Comparison Tool, which are unique educational programs designed for specific school types like a HBCU, mens or womens-only college, etc."</i>

  - 1. If you wanted to know a little more about a specialized mission and what it is, can you show me where you would find that information within the tool?
    - Document notes on what participant is saying and doing
    - Comments about the level of difficulty or ease locating the component/descriptions
  - 2. Were you able to locate the information you were looking for without difficulty?
  

### Guidance/actions to follow if participant gets distracted from tasks
  - 1. <i>"There are still a few more questions related to [the task]. Would it be alright if we revisit that for a moment?"</i>
  - 2. <i>"We have a bit more to cover regarding [the task]. Would you be comfortable if we go back to it briefly?"</i>
  - 3. <i>"There are a few more aspects of [the task] we'd like to explore. Is it okay with you if we return to it for a moment?"</i>
  - 4. <i>"We still have some questions about [the task]. Is it okay if we continue with that for a bit longer?"</i>

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- A couple of questions for you before we close out:
  - 1. Were you satisfied with the outcomes generated by the comparison tool's Specialized Mission Filters?
    - <i>[Is this what the participant expected?]</i>
  - 2. Is there anything you think we should do differently with this feature? 
  - 3. Is there anything else that you would like to discuss that we didn't go over today?

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

<i>"We greatly appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback will be helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it helps Veterans find what they need."</i>
  - <i>"Is it okay with you if we decide to use this recording from our discussion today with other VA partners?"</i>
    - If yes: <i>"Is there a part of our discussion that you do not want us to share?</i>
    - [Assure the participant that the video recording will remain confidential and will only be accessible to authorized individuals.]

<i>"Finally, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
