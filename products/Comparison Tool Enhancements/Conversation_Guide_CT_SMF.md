## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today. My name is Garry Forbes. I'll be your moderator for this session, and my GovCIO colleague Ariana Adili will be taking notes. Other colleagues may be in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes as we work through the session.

The subject of this study is filtering options and capabilities--specifically, the Specialized Mission Filters--that are available in the GI Bill Comparison Tool. We'd like you to try the filters to see how they're applied to educational institution searches, and let us know if you think they'll be useful to you.

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.**
- I want to be sure not to keep you much longer than that.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**
- The sole purpose of this study is to improve the tools to better match Veteran's needs. We will not be offended by any opinions you express, and welcome any feedback you may have.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.**

**Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
- If no: Use Slack to kindly ask other observers to leave the call.
- If yes: Admit observers.
  - Then ask the note-taker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, such as their first name and position with VA.gov.
  - Once complete, ask note-taker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth.

**Are you okay with my recording the screen activities and audio as we talk today?**

- *If yes:* **Once I start recording, I'll confirm once more that you are ok with me recording this session.**
- *Start recording.*

- **I have started the recording**
- I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record screen activities and audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 3 minutes

Before we look at the GI Bill Comparison Tool and its filtering capabilities, letâ€™s start with a few quick questions about your familiarity with the tool.

- Have you used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before?
- If so, did you (or do you normally) use it on a desktop device or a mobile device?
- Are you familiar with the comparison tool's filtering features?
- If so, have you used the specialized mission filter (SMF) feature?

No worries if you haven't used the comparison tool before; either way, we'll provide you with the link to open and use the tool and its filtering features. We'll also let you know how you can share your screen with us as you proceed through the study.

## Now let's take a look at the comparison tool's filtering options

Here's how to open the GI Bill Comparison Tool in the staging area:
- Open a browser window and go to https://staging.va.gov/education/gi-bill-comparison-tool   
  To use the tool's results filtering feature:
  - Enter a full or partial name of a school or institution into the Search by name field
  - Use the filtering options by choosing one or more of the checkboxes below the Search box
  - Select one or more of the specialized mission filters
  - Click or tap 'update filters'
  - Note: clear filters option is available should you need it

Note that you can, at any time, change or refine the results by modifying your filter selections and pressing Search.

Now let's try it out.

[ Allow time for the participant to get comfortable with the app after opening it ]

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- A couple of questions for you before we close out:
  - Were you satisfied with the outcomes of your use of the comparison tool's filtering features?
  - On a scale of 1-5 (1 being not easy/low value and 5 very easy/high value) please rank the ease of use and value of the filtering features
- Any final questions for us?

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

We greatly appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback will be helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it helps Veterans find what they need.

Finally, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Again, thank you so much for your time, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
