# Research Plan for 2022-08 Comparison Tool Enhancements - Survey 

This research request comes from the Digital GI Bill team for the Veterans Benefits Administration Education Service. Digital GI Bill looks to modernize the GI Bill experience in order to improve the user experience, improve claims processing, address the complexities of recent legislation, and integrate the legacy IT systems. This research plan comes from the Human Centered Design (HCD) agile team as we look to conduct usability testing for a feature within VA education, The Comparison Tool. Usability testing will inform us how students can learn about and compare their GI Bill benefits at approved schools, employers and VET TEC providers. 

## Background
The Digital GI Bill team looks to update features of the GI Bill Comparison Tool, an unauthenticated feature on Va.gov, to enable students to make better decisions about their GI Bill benefits. The current state of the GI Bill Comparison Tool has unintuitive features that may make navigating the tool a suboptimal experience. The GI Bill Comparison tool is used by all potential education beneficiaries, including Veterans, service members, and their family members. How might we improve the GI Bill Comparison Tool so that it is built for every journey?

### OCTO Objectives 
* Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
* Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov
* Platform users can build and deploy high-quality products for Veterans

### Veteran Journey
* Aquiring the appropriate education, new skills, and credentials
* Finding the right job
* Taking care of my family

### Outcome
1. Understand what designs across the Comparison Tool work best for the user and reduce burden/cognitive load, while also being cognizant of accessibility concerns
2. Understand what content is most important to a user when deciding on their best suited school
3. Utilize these findings to iterate on current designs and let user research drive the rest of the design process


### Research questions
1. Before seeing designs, what are the user preferences for information within the Comparison tool?
2. What does the user prefer/prioritize when presented with alternative design options? What additional comments do they have?
3. What is most important content on institution cards for the user?


### Hypothesis
For students who have used education benefits in the past, we anticipate that the enhanced comparison tool features will be clearer and more intuitive for them. Updated formatting and icons will all enhance the user experience. When comparing to the current-state Comparison Tool, users might be may feel more confident choosing the right school for their unique education journey. We also believe future design iterations will be necessary to meet the diverse needs of all users.  

## Method	
**1. What method of research are you planning?**	
- The team will be collecting user feedback for the comparison tool feature via a cohort-based research survey. All research will be conducted in a remote, unmoderated setting. Participants will receive a custom survey link and instructions via Microsoft Form.  

**2. Methodology**
- All participants will receive the survey link with instructions to complete the form. The survey will remain open until Friday September 9th at 5 pm est.  

**3. Why this method? How dos this methodology help you answer your research questions?**
- Research surveys are a flexible research tool to gather information about the comparison tool users, their attitudes, and their behaviors. By using a research survey method, we can track both quantitative and qualitative data to help inform future design iterations. This survey will use a combination of both open-ended responses, multiple choice questions, and rankings to gather information about user’s preferences.  

**4. Location**
- This will be remote, unmoderated research.

## Recruitment	

**1. Strategy**
- Recruitment will be conducted remotely from Perigean: If approved for this research request, we would like assistance from Perigean to recruit students that fall under our primary participant criterion characteristics. We have conducted UT before and have outlined specific metrics informed by OCTO’s targets to conduct inclusive research. 

**2. Primary Criteriaa** 
- Target sample size: 36 participants
- Cohort requirements: Cohorts will be an important metric for this study and must be included in the participation screener. We are seeking:
	- Cohort A: Used GI bill Education Benefits for a VET TEC Program
	- Cohort B: Used GI Bill education benefits for an OJT/apprenticeship program 
	- Cohort C: Used GI Bill education benefits at a 4-year college or university
	- Cohort D: Identifies as being a first-generation college student 
	- Participant type: Veteran or their family member who has used or is actively using GI Bill benefits
	- Size: 9 participants per cohort

- Login Requirements: Participant must have access to a computer or mobile phone to acess the survey and input responses
- GI Bill Benefit Usage: Participants have used or are actively using their GI Bill benefits
- Accessibillity Preferences: We want to be sure to include the following Veteran groups below. **These demographics should make up the total 36 participants, but can be spread arbitrarily through the 4 earlier identified cohorts**:
	- Race/Ethnicity: Identify as Black or African American (15%), Latinx (12%), Biracial (4%), Asian (3%), Native (1%) 
	- 6% LGBTQ+ 
	- 60% Women  
	- 50% Identify as 55-64+  
	- 50% Identify as having a cognitive disability 
	- 25% Identify as inhabitant of a rural area 
	- 20% Identify as having immigrant origin 
	- 0.5% Identify as living abroad

**3. Cohort Screener Questions**
- Have you used or are you actively using GI Bill education benefits to complete a VET TEC program? Participants that answer yes can be included under Cohort A. 
- Have you used or are you actively using GI Bill education benefits to complete an On-the-job training or apprenticeship program? Participants that answer yes can be included under Cohort B. 
- Have you used or are you actively using GI Bill benefits to complete a four-year college degree? Participants that answer yes can be included under Cohort C. 
- Do you currently identify as a first-generation college student? Participants that answer yes can be included under Cohort D. 

**4. Additional Screener Questions**
- Location of the participant and basic demographic qualifiers screening, including: age, race, sex, state of residence (country if outside the US); what GI Bill benefit they are using  
- With respect to your GI Bill education, what degree are you working toward? (1. Associate Degree 2. Undergraduate Degree 3. Graduate Degree 3. Non-College Degree Program 4. Other. 5. None).  
- How would you describe your familiarity with technology? (very poor, poor, neutral, good, very good).  

## Timeline
 If possible, we’d like the surveys to be distributed to participants starting Monday, September 5th, at 9 am Est or as soon as recruitment is finalized by Perigean. We will keep the survey open until Tuesday, September 13th at 5 pm Est.  At the conclusion of participant input, the team will export data from MS Forms over to this github research folder, or otherwise take screen shots. We will also scrub any PII/PHI that users input.
