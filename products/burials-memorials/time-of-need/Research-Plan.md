# Research Plan for BAH-MBS-SelfServ, Time of Need Lite, [July 2025]

## Background 🏗️
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary> 

  
**To develop a secure, user-friendly digital form accessible via both web and mobile platforms on VA.gov. This form will allow authorized individuals and organizations to submit burial requests electronically, streamlining the initiation process with the NCSO**

`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

**Currently, there is no way for family members, authorized organizations, or personal representatives to initiate a burial request for a deceased Veteran, spouse, or dependent child through VA.gov. They must call the National Cemetery Scheduling Office (NCSO) directly, resulting in longer processing times and added stress for families and representatives during a difficult time. Time of Need Lite aims to provide a secure, user-friendly digital form on VA.gov for submitting burial requests electronically, streamlining the process.**
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

**Time of Need Lite will be accessible via both web and mobile platforms on VA.gov, both authenticated and unauthenticated services (to allow family, friends, funeral homes, and representatives to access and submit requests).**

`What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

**This is a new product; there is currently no digital self-service option for initiating burial requests through VA.gov. Veterans and their families have previously interacted only by phone, so this tool is new to them.**

<details><summary>Which OCTO priorities does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed. </summary>

`Objective 1: VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.`

**Key Results for this research:**
- **Percentage of ToN requests submitted via self-service:** _Initial: 50%, Target: 70%+_
- **Reduction in call center volume for ToN submissions:** _Initial: 20%+, Target: 40%+ reduction_
- **User satisfaction rating:** _Target: 4+ out of 5_
- **Successful submission rate:** _Target: 95%+_
- **Average submission time:** _Target: <15 minutes_>   - _Testing will evaluate if users can successfully complete the form and receive clear feedback on submission outcomes or errors._

## Research Goals 🥅	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

> [!NOTE]
> Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.

### Goals

`1.` **Evaluate the usability and accessibility of the Time of Need Lite digital form for scheduling a burial.**

`2.` **Identify pain points and barriers that Veterans' family members, personal representatives, and funeral home staff experience when using the form.**

`3.` **Gauge user satisfaction with the digital experience compared to the current phone-based process.**
  
### Outcome
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

---

**Findings will inform iterative improvements to the form's design, content, and workflow. Insights will be used to optimize the user experience, prioritize accessibility and clarity, and refine the MVP for public launch. User feedback will directly influence next-phase feature development and business process alignment.**

---

### Research questions

**`1.` Can users complete and submit a burial scheduling request without confusion or errors?**

**`2.` What information or steps do users find unclear or challenging in the form?**

**`3.` How does the digital process compare to the phone-based process in terms of efficiency and emotional burden for users?**

**`4.` Are there accessibility challenges or barriers for users with disabilities?**

**`5.` What additional features or support do users wish were available in the digital form?**

### Hypotheses

---

**Users will be able to complete and submit the burial request form digitally with fewer errors and less stress than the current phone-based process. Most usability issues will stem from unfamiliar terminology or unclear instructions, and accessibility improvements may be needed for specific cohorts. Digital submission will be perceived as more convenient and less emotionally taxing.**

---

## Methodology  🛠️

**Moderated usability testing via Microsoft Teams. Participants will be asked to schedule a burial for a Veteran, spouse, or dependent child using the Time of Need Lite prototype. This method is appropriate as it allows observation of user interactions, collection of real-time feedback, and facilitates accessibility accommodations.**
