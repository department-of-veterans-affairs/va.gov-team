# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **[NAME]** and **[NOTETAKER NAME]** is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about how the VA is developing a new digital way for families and representatives to schedule burials for Veterans at national cemeteries.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any criticism.
  
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way.
  
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you comfortable with observers joining?** *Yes.
   - <mark>**If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.</mark>
   - **If yes:** Admit observers.
     
> [!TIP]
> - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
> - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
     
- *(If applicable)* **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.
  
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings will be deleted. *Yes, that’s fine.
   - **Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
     
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across VA is by showing short video clips. If you agree, we would only share clips that don’t include any identifying information.
   - **Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?** *Yes.
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

➡️ **Start recording.**

> [!TIP]
> After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
 
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** *That is fine.

# Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. "Have you previously scheduled a burial? If yes, how did you do it?" *I did, it was not easy and took forever and I was not sure I did it right. 
2. "What was your experience like with that process? What worked well? * It was the form they make you fill out and mail it in. I was about 4-5 years ago now. Might have been less but not by much. 
   What was frustrating?" *It took forever to figure out how to do it. I had to google it. I was eligible to get buried in a VA cemetery and lots of googling, and trying to track down the form, and waiting to hear back, not sure I did it right or wrong. 

# Usability Actions & Ratings

I am going to give you a scenario. You will then fill out the form as if you were this person, and complete a few tasks in the prototype.
For each of the following actions, please attempt the task as you naturally would. After each, I’ll ask you to rate how easy or difficult it was.

Scenarios (alternating with each session)

**You are Bram Stoker, a funeral home representative. You are applying to schedule a burial for a deceased Veteran named Jonathon Harker.**

or

**You are Jonathon Harker, a Veteran with VA benefits. You are applying to schedule a burial for your deceased spouse, Mina Harker.**
*I would click to see if my wife Mina is eligible. That would have been my first choice. 
* I would click this next (confirm the type) link. 
**Are you aware of what a pre-need is? * Yes, I am because I have done this. I don’t think anyone else would be aware of it. 
---

## Action 1: Determining your relationship to the Veteran

- Please indicate your relationship to the Veteran.
*
**Rating:**  
On a scale of 1 (very difficult) to 5 (very easy), how would you rate the ease of determining and selecting your relationship to the Veteran? *I would be the sponsor. I didn’t get stuck but it can be confusing if you’re older. 

1. "Did any of the labels or terms confuse you?"
2. "What did the label "personal representative" mean to you?" *That would to me if that was the wife doing this on my behalf if I  a POA or the person caring for the Veteran. 
   
<mark>**[Record rating and comments here]**</mark>

> [!NOTE]
> Things to watch for:
- Does participant understand all relationship options?
- Do they click on the "Personal Representative" accordion for definition?
- Do they hesitate on which option applies to them?
- Is the list comprehensive for their situation?
- Usage of additional help within the form, such as help components, information accordians, or external links

## Action 2: Entering a Veteran service period

- Please enter a Veteran service period using the interface provided.

**Rating:**  
On a scale of 1 (very difficult) to 5 (very easy), how would you rate the ease of entering a Veteran service period? *A 3 because I don’t remember the day and now I have to track the information down. 
<mark>**[Record rating and comments here]**</mark>

[If participant hesitates]: "Use your best estimate if you're not certain." * This is hard. This is going to require to get my DD-214. I think it would be easier to have month and year because no one is going to remember their actual day. I would be required to find my DD214 form. 
*As someone like me, I would need to go into my fireproof safe to get the actual day. 
[After entry]: "How confident are you that you entered the correct dates?"

> [!NOTE]
> Things to watch for:
> - Did the participant understand what was being asked?
> - Did they encounter any points of confusion?
> - Did they make errors or need to ask for clarification?
> - Did they find the field labels clear?
> - Did they complete the action without help?

## Action 3: Finding a preferred national cemetery

- Please find and select a preferred national cemetery.

**Rating:**  
On a scale of 1 (very difficult) to 5 (very easy), how would you rate the ease of finding a preferred national cemetery? *I guess it would be, if it brings you the site it would be easy. 
<mark>**[Record rating and comments here]**</mark>
Task: Please indicate your preferred national cemetery for this burial.
[Context]: "The deceased Veteran's family prefers to be buried in their home state."

Things to watch for:
- Does participant understand they're selecting a specific cemetery? * I personally didn’t know that anyone can pick any of them. I picked which is closest to my town. Now, I wish I would of known I can pick anywhere. 
- Do they use search/filter vs. browse the list?
- If cemetery options are limited/unavailable, how do they respond? * They had me pick two or three of them and I had to list them. I picked it on location not knowing. 
*I would pick a non-location-based option, based on where my kids live to be close to them. 
- Understanding of what "national cemetery" means?
- Difficulty with state selection or cemetery availability?
- How do they know which cemetery to choose?
*Should the call it cremains, I guess I learned a new term because I have never heard of it. Would it tell me what that means? What is intact green? To me this is useless. 
* This is new, I didn’t have to give any funeral home contact, it was not require in the form. I haven’t looked at one yet for myself. 

Post-task probe:
- "How would you know which cemetery to select?"
- "What if the preferred cemetery wasn't available?"

*Download PDF, print this page is nice. 
*No one faxes. This is crazy. Email is something that should be sent to. Faxing is outdated.

## Overall Ease of Use

After you’ve completed these actions, on a scale of 1 to 5, how easy or difficult did you find using this part of the website overall? *I put it at 4 or 4.5. It was straight forward but I did have questions about cremains, cremains greens.  
<mark>**[Record overall rating and comments here]**</mark>

# Post-Task Interview - 8 minutes
- "What do you think happens now after you submit the form?" * According to this, they will call me and schedule it. 
- "What part of the process felt most overwhelming or confusing?" *Overwhelming would be gathering my DD214. I can’t proceed but I don’t know the day. 
- "Were there any parts of this form that you found to be unclear? * Just the types of remains. 
- "Compared to calling the VA or an in-person visit, how would this compare?" *I would prefer this. If I was grieving my dead wife, I don’t want to deal with people. 


## Emotional & Cognitive Load Assessment

After completing the form, use these probes:

- "Did the length or complexity of the form feel manageable?" *Yes, I think it would be easier on a website. It seems like forever on a little screen. On a phone, it just shows how many more pages, I just click and click. I like that you can save it for later. At least it gives you that option. 
* You should have a warning that if not signed in, your progress can be lost. 
- "Were there any questions that felt intrusive or insensitive?" *No.
- "Would you feel comfortable completing this on your own, or would you want help or support?" * I felt comfortable. 
  - "What additional information, help, or support would have made this process easier for you?"
- "Is there anything you wish was available on this form or in the process?" 

Moderator notes should track:
- Emotional shifts (frustration, hesitation, distress)
- Engagement level (focused vs. distracted)
- Confidence statements ("I think..." vs. "I'm not sure...")

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could identify you.
   - **If yes:** Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
