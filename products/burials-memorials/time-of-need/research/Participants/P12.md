# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **[NAME]** and **[NOTETAKER NAME]** is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about how the VA is developing a new digital way for families and representatives to schedule burials for Veterans at national cemeteries.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any criticism.
  
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way.
  
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you comfortable with observers joining?** *Yes.
   - <mark>**If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.</mark>
   - **If yes:** Admit observers.
     
> [!TIP]
> - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
> - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
     
- *(If applicable)* **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.
  
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings will be deleted.
   - **Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
     
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across VA is by showing short video clips. If you agree, we would only share clips that don’t include any identifying information.
   - **Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?** *That is fine.
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

➡️ **Start recording.**

> [!TIP]
> After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? *

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
 
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** *Yes.

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

# Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. "Have you previously scheduled a burial? If yes, how did you do it?" *In a performance of my Officer work, I assisted spouses for filing, reimbursement for their deceased member, and assisted them to a national cemetery with a manager in support of getting their remains placed in the cemetery. From a personal standpoint, I had a son who was a Veteran who passed away, that was not through the VA, just a normal burial with a commercial cemetery. 
2. "What was your experience like with that process? What worked well? *Both online and in-person. I helped the surviving spouse develop and complete the 540 form, and I asked her the questions to enter into the form. 
   What was frustrating?" *The reimbursement process from the VA is dependent on the amount if the death was service-connected or not. The veteran passed away due to an existing disability they were being compensated for or listed as a possible reason. If the amount is service-connected, it's about 2,000 dollars max. It has been an item of contention that requires an explanation to the widow from time to time. 

# Usability Actions & Ratings

I am going to give you a scenario. You will then fill out the form as if you were this person, and complete a few taks in the prototype.
For each of the following actions, please attempt the task as you naturally would. After each, I’ll ask you to rate how easy or difficult it was.

Scenarios (alternating with each session)

**You are Bram Stoker, a funeral home representative. You are applying to schedule a burial for a deceased Veteran named Jonathon Harker.**

or

**You are Jonathon Harker, a Veteran with VA benefits. You are applying to schedule a burial for your deceased spouse, Mina Harker.**

---

## Action 1: Determining your relationship to the Veteran
*So if I were to click on this blue link, will it take them to a VA form or not? 
*Would that article have information if you don’t know what to do, how they can get a hold of a VSO. 
**Do you know what a pre-need is?   * I probably know what the material is but not the title of this letter. 
*I would choose spouse because 99% of the people I work with are a spouse. Sorry, it would be Veteran for this scenario. 

- Please indicate your relationship to the Veteran. 

**Rating:**  
On a scale of 1 (very difficult) to 5 (very easy), how would you rate the ease of determining and selecting your relationship to the Veteran?

1. "Did any of the labels or terms confuse you?" *Other than the need letter, the rest of it is upfront and clear. 
2. "What did the label "personal representative" mean to you?" *The labels, the personal representative could be an attorney, VSO, another family member, Other- I would assume you would have to explain that somewhere. It’s fine. 
*Why is there two questions asking for the same thing, funeral home ID number. Oh, I see it explains that. 
   
<mark>**[Record rating and comments here]**</mark>

> [!NOTE]
> Things to watch for:
- Does participant understand all relationship options?
- Do they click on the "Personal Representative" accordion for definition?
- Do they hesitate on which option applies to them?
- Is the list comprehensive for their situation?
- Usage of additional help within the form, such as help components, information accordians, or external links
*Rather than the word Your, have select the Funeral home address.
*I think the previous screen, if you answered yes about the child, and the next screen is the Deceased, it’s clear with they want, but usually it’s the deceased information they want first. 

---

## Action 2: Entering a Veteran service period

- Please enter a Veteran service period using the interface provided.

**Rating:**  
On a scale of 1 (very difficult) to 5 (very easy), how would you rate the ease of entering a Veteran service period? *Lets go back and add a service period, the question is very clear and if they had two DD214 forms, you can extract the date and add. That is clear. I think it’s a 5, very easy. 
<mark>**[Record rating and comments here]**</mark>

[If participant hesitates]: "Use your best estimate if you're not certain."
[After entry]: "How confident are you that you entered the correct dates?"
*
> [!NOTE]
> Things to watch for:
> - Did the participant understand what was being asked?
> - Did they encounter any points of confusion?
> - Did they make errors or need to ask for clarification?
> - Did they find the field labels clear?
> - Did they complete the action without help?

## Action 3: Finding a preferred national cemetery

- Please find and select a preferred national cemetery.

**Rating:**  
On a scale of 1 (very difficult) to 5 (very easy), how would you rate the ease of finding a preferred national cemetery? *If I click on there, it will list every cemetery, and I can choose from. That’s good. More than likely, someone working with a mortuary they will know the sites but it’s good that there is a site. 
<mark>**[Record rating and comments here]**</mark>
Task: Please indicate your preferred national cemetery for this burial.
[Context]: "The deceased Veteran's family prefers to be buried in their home state."

Things to watch for:
- Does the participant understand they're selecting a specific cemetery?
- Do they use search/filter vs. browse the list?
- If cemetery options are limited/unavailable, how do they respond? *Then some negotiations need to take place with the spouse on a spot that has availability 
- Understanding of what "national cemetery" means?
- Difficulty with state selection or cemetery availability?
- How do they know which cemetery to choose?

Post-task probe:
- "How would you know which cemetery to select?"
- "What if the preferred cemetery wasn't available?"

## Overall Ease of Use

After you’ve completed these actions, on a scale of 1 to 5, how easy or difficult did you find using this part of the website overall? * I consider very easy. 
<mark>**[Record overall rating and comments here]**</mark>

# Post-Task Interview - 8 minutes
- "What do you think happens now after you submit the form?" * Is the surviding spouse will be contacted someway whether email, phone if there is room, here is a map of the facility, yes to the schedule day and time. Some contact document. 
- "What part of the process felt most overwhelming or confusing?" *I don’t think any of it is confusing to me entering the data. I think it’s fine. 
- "Were there any parts of this form that you found to be unclear? * Other than something might be worded differently, other than that no. Again, if it’s the employee view point, I don’t think they would confused more than once. If the word “your” would be taken out. 
- "Compared to calling the VA or an in-person visit, how would this compare?" *Any process that keeps you from calling the VA is probably easier. Dealing with the actual person at the funeral home is the best way to go. 


## Emotional & Cognitive Load Assessment

After completing the form, use these probes:

- "Did the length or complexity of the form feel manageable?" *I did to me. It’s fine.
- "Were there any questions that felt intrusive or insensitive?" *I don’t understand the question if they were a sex offender. I didn’t know that was a requirement. 
- "Would you feel comfortable completing this on your own, or would you want help or support?" *I would feel comfortable doing it on my own. I think it’s simple enough and clear. 
  - "What additional information, help, or support would have made this process easier for you?"
- "Is there anything you wish was available on this form or in the process?" *Other than the ability for a dependent son or daughter to be allowed to bury the deceased veteran's wife. She now has the authorization to use the same plot. She has the ability to be buried with him. That process would need to be done for her. 

Moderator notes should track:
- Emotional shifts (frustration, hesitation, distress)
- Engagement level (focused vs. distracted)
- Confidence statements ("I think..." vs. "I'm not sure...")

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could identify you.
   - **If yes:** Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip? *That is fine.
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
