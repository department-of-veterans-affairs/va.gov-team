# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **[NAME]** and **[NOTETAKER NAME]** is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about how the VA is developing a new digital way for families and representatives to schedule burials for Veterans at national cemeteries.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any criticism.
  
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way.
  
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you comfortable with observers joining?**
   - <mark>**If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.</mark>
   - **If yes:** Admit observers.
     
> [!TIP]
> - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
> - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
     
- *(If applicable)* **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.
  
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings will be deleted. *Yes.
   - **Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
     
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across VA is by showing short video clips. If you agree, we would only share clips that don’t include any identifying information. *Yes. 
   - **Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?** *Yes. 
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

➡️ **Start recording.**

> [!TIP]
> After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
 
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** *I’m fine with that. 

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

# Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. "Have you previously scheduled a burial? If yes, how did you do it?" *I have assisted Veteran family members multiple times. I have done a call into NCA to get it started and the cemetery. We found out recently that NCA needed us to go online for that particular one. 
2. "What was your experience like with that process? What worked well? * In the past its been very easy. Call in, get a pre-need, get a case number. This time, The NCA told us to do it online and they wanted to make sure he was eligible, and it was difficult to do it online because they need login info, and it’s handcuffing me when I try to help other people other than myself since I’m a Veteran myself. 
*We have forms that are easy but with 8 pages of instructions, and they are grieving, and what is their service number and not every DD14 will tell you. So for families dealing with grief, that is a lot of information for them to understand. 
*A family trying to read a DD14, there’s a lot of hoops to jump through and to get dates down to get some of this stuff. 
   What was frustrating?"

# Usability Actions & Ratings

I am going to give you a scenario. You will then fill out the form as if you were this person, and complete a few taks in the prototype.
For each of the following actions, please attempt the task as you naturally would. After each, I’ll ask you to rate how easy or difficult it was.

Scenarios (alternating with each session)

**You are Bram Stoker, a funeral home representative. You are applying to schedule a burial for a deceased Veteran named Jonathon Harker.** * I would go to star your application. 

or

**You are Jonathon Harker, a Veteran with VA benefits. You are applying to schedule a burial for your deceased spouse, Mina Harker.**

---

## Action 1: Determining your relationship to the Veteran

- Please indicate your relationship to the Veteran.

**Rating:**  
On a scale of 1 (very difficult) to 5 (very easy), how would you rate the ease of determining and selecting your relationship to the Veteran? *That’s a 5.

1. "Did any of the labels or terms confuse you?" *If I were doing this in my office, I would think, for me I would have to choose other unless I’m filling out for the family member because there is no VSO. If you’re the personal representative, you’ll need to provide certain documents. Some of the funeral homes will do this, in this area, not so much. I as a VSO, they are saying there is extra documentation and as a power of Attorney through the VA. As a volunteer, I don’t get paid; I fall under an umbrella. 
2. "What did the label "personal representative" mean to you?" *Someone who doesn’t have anyone else like a judiciary. 
   
<mark>**[Record rating and comments here]**</mark>

> [!NOTE]
> Things to watch for:
- Does participant understand all relationship options?
- Do they click on the "Personal Representative" accordion for definition?
- Do they hesitate on which option applies to them?
- Is the list comprehensive for their situation?
- Usage of additional help within the form, such as help components, information accordians, or external links

---

## Action 2: Entering a Veteran service period

- Please enter a Veteran service period using the interface provided. 

**Rating:**  
On a scale of 1 (very difficult) to 5 (very easy), how would you rate the ease of entering a Veteran service period? *4. We are getting past the time with Veterans who do multiple duties. The reserve time will make them eligible for an actual approved cemetery. We are also approaching a generation where Veterans have multiple DD214 forms. 
*Some families may ger confused and some families don’t even know what a DD214 is. 
<mark>**[Record rating and comments here]**</mark>

[If participant hesitates]: "Use your best estimate if you're not certain."
[After entry]: "How confident are you that you entered the correct dates?"

> [!NOTE]
> Things to watch for:
> - Did the participant understand what was being asked?
> - Did they encounter any points of confusion?
> - Did they make errors or need to ask for clarification?
> - Did they find the field labels clear?
> - Did they complete the action without help?

---

## Action 3: Finding a preferred national cemetery

- Please find and select a preferred national cemetery.

**Rating:**  
On a scale of 1 (very difficult) to 5 (very easy), how would you rate the ease of finding a preferred national cemetery? *That one is a 4 because, here locally we have two national cemeteries. 
<mark>**[Record rating and comments here]**</mark>
Task: Please indicate your preferred national cemetery for this burial.
[Context]: "The deceased Veteran's family prefers to be buried in their home state."

Things to watch for:
- Does participant understand they're selecting a specific cemetery?
- Do they use search/filter vs. browse the list?
- If cemetery options are limited/unavailable, how do they respond?
- Understanding of what "national cemetery" means?
- Difficulty with state selection or cemetery availability?
- How do they know which cemetery to choose?

Post-task probe:
- "How would you know which cemetery to select?"
- "What if the preferred cemetery wasn't available?" Hopefully, there is a Google search and see what is available. I would use the proximity of the cemetery to base my location. 

> [!NOTE]

- Do they use search/filter vs. browse the list?

- Difficulty with state selection or cemetery availability?
- How do they know which cemetery to choose?
*The out container is confusing. 
-How do you like the review your application?  *Everything I do has to have a signature. The VA wont accept a form without a signature on it.

## Overall Ease of Use

After you’ve completed these actions, on a scale of 1 to 5, how easy or difficult did you find using this part of the website overall? * Overall a 5. If you’re a funeral home this shouldn’t be difficult at all. 
<mark>**[Record overall rating and comments here]**</mark>

# Post-Task Interview - 8 minutes
- "What do you think happens now after you submit the form?" *In 24-48 hours I should get a response so I can schedule at the burial. I would expect a phone call. 
- "What part of the process felt most overwhelming or confusing?" *The questions abot the outside container because I’m not a funeral director. 
- "Were there any parts of this form that you found to be unclear? *No, I understand everything. I’m going to go back to family members who may not find it so easy and some other unknowns. 
- "Compared to calling the VA or an in-person visit, how would this compare?" *Me acting a representative as family member took less time on the phone. Again, they typed everything and notified me what he was eligible for. I liked about this, the NCA reps are always apologetic for some felonies a veteran may not be eligible. Just some legal questions I’m supposed to ask. 


## Emotional & Cognitive Load Assessment

After completing the form, use these probes:

- "Did the length or complexity of the form feel manageable?" *Yes.
- "Were there any questions that felt intrusive or insensitive?" *No. I know the questions about felonies can be offensive to someone, but the family may or may not know. 
- "Would you feel comfortable completing this on your own, or would you want help or support?"
  - "What additional information, help, or support would have made this process easier for you?" *I can do this on my own.
- "Is there anything you wish was available on this form or in the process?" *You get the option for a symbol on it like a cross or something like that, if you’re doing it on the phone you won't see the options. 

Moderator notes should track:
- Emotional shifts (frustration, hesitation, distress)
- Engagement level (focused vs. distracted)
- Confidence statements ("I think..." vs. "I'm not sure...")

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could identify you. *Not a problem. 
   - **If yes:** Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
