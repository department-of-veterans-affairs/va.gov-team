# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **[NAME]** and **[NOTETAKER NAME]** is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about how the VA is developing a new digital way for families and representatives to schedule burials for Veterans at national cemeteries.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any criticism.
  
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way.
  
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you comfortable with observers joining?** *Not a problem. 
   - <mark>**If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.</mark>
   - **If yes:** Admit observers.
     
> [!TIP]
> - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
> - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
     
- *(If applicable)* **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.
  
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings will be deleted.
   - **Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
     
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across VA is by showing short video clips. If you agree, we would only share clips that don’t include any identifying information.
   - **Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?** *Fair enough. 
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

➡️ **Start recording.**

> [!TIP]
> After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
 
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

# Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. "Have you previously scheduled a burial? If yes, how did you do it?" * Yes. 
2. "What was your experience like with that process? What worked well? *If I recall, people had registered with the Cemetery in Cape Code and the paperwork was done in advance, and it made everything smooth. Yes, done in person. I also have the necessary things done for my own thing. 
   What was frustrating?" * I’m not sure I had any frustration because the third party, funeral had done the leg work and processing. 

# Usability Actions & Ratings

I am going to give you a scenario. You will then fill out the form as if you were this person, and complete a few tasks in the prototype.
For each of the following actions, please attempt the task as you naturally would. After each, I’ll ask you to rate how easy or difficult it was.

Scenarios (alternating with each session)

**You are Bram Stoker, a funeral home representative. You are applying to schedule a burial for a deceased Veteran named Jonathon Harker.**
**Are you familiar with what a Pre-need letter is? *No, I’m afraid not. * Yes, actually I do have one, didn’t know what it was called. 
or

**You are Jonathon Harker, a Veteran with VA benefits. You are applying to schedule a burial for your deceased spouse, Mina Harker.**

---

## Action 1: Determining your relationship to the Veteran

- Please indicate your relationship to the Veteran.

**Rating:**  
On a scale of 1 (very difficult) to 5 (very easy), how would you rate the ease of determining and selecting your relationship to the Veteran? *I would give it a 4, based on that screen being pre-need. 

1. "Did any of the labels or terms confuse you?" *No.
2. "What did the label "personal representative" mean to you?" *The executive of someone’s will. 
   
<mark>**[Record rating and comments here]**</mark>

> [!NOTE]
> Things to watch for:
- Does participant understand all relationship options?
- Do they click on the "Personal Representative" accordion for definition?
- Do they hesitate on which option applies to them?
- Is the list comprehensive for their situation?
- Usage of additional help within the form, such as help components, information accordians, or external links
*Now that is confusing, the beginning I selected I was the funeral home representative and now a funeral home in North Carolina. 
*Now it’s asking for personal representative information and it’s confusing to go back and forth. If I were the funeral home representative, how would I know this. 
*If I didn’t have the information and it was required, I wouldn’t be able to move forward. 
---

## Action 2: Entering a Veteran service period

- Please enter a Veteran service period using the interface provided.
**Does the term, adult independent child, do you know what that mean? *Yes. 

**Rating:**  
On a scale of 1 (very difficult) to 5 (very easy), how would you rate the ease of entering a Veteran service period? *4 and 5 eighths. Some of these questions, I had to go through you to get an answer. Fine line, it was a 4. The only thing that stumped me was the pre-need. 
<mark>**[Record rating and comments here]**</mark>

[If participant hesitates]: "Use your best estimate if you're not certain."
[After entry]: "How confident are you that you entered the correct dates?"

> [!NOTE]
> Things to watch for:
> - Did the participant understand what was being asked?
> - Did they encounter any points of confusion?
> - Did they make errors or need to ask for clarification?
> - Did they find the field labels clear?
> - Did they complete the action without help?
---

## Action 3: Finding a preferred national cemetery

- Please find and select a preferred national cemetery.

**Rating:**  
On a scale of 1 (very difficult) to 5 (very easy), how would you rate the ease of finding a preferred national cemetery? * That’s easy, 5. 
<mark>**[Record rating and comments here]**</mark>
Task: Please indicate your preferred national cemetery for this burial.
[Context]: "The deceased Veteran's family prefers to be buried in their home state."

Things to watch for:
- Does participant understand they're selecting a specific cemetery? 
- Do they use search/filter vs. browse the list?
- If cemetery options are limited/unavailable, how do they respond?
- Understanding of what "national cemetery" means?
- Difficulty with state selection or cemetery availability?
- How do they know which cemetery to choose?

Post-task probe:
- "How would you know which cemetery to select?" * I don’t know. I would say the one the deceased/executive decides that. 
- "What if the preferred cemetery wasn't available?" *I would say something closer to the initial one selected. 
* I would open all the tabs to review. 
> [!NOTE]
Things to watch for:
- Does participant understand they're selecting a specific cemetery?
- Do they use search/filter vs. browse the list?
- If cemetery options are limited/unavailable, how do they respond?
- Understanding of what "national cemetery" means?
- Difficulty with state selection or cemetery availability?
- How do they know which cemetery to choose?
*I’m not sure what the “greens” are. What does the Intact green mean.

## Overall Ease of Use

After you’ve completed these actions, on a scale of 1 to 5, how easy or difficult did you find using this part of the website overall? *I would say 5. If you write that differently like, “do you have an authorized letter instead of a pre-need, perhaps I wouldn’t be stumped with that. 
<mark>**[Record overall rating and comments here]**</mark>

# Post-Task Interview - 8 minutes
- "What do you think happens now after you submit the form?" *I assume I would hear back from the cemetery to schedule it. I would say they would respond the same way I’m responding to this. 
- "What part of the process felt most overwhelming or confusing?" *Fairly easy. If I were a funeral director I would know how to answer this. 
- "Were there any parts of this form that you found to be unclear? *No. 
- "Compared to calling the VA or an in-person visit, how would this compare?" * This would depend on the person I’m speaking with and how familiar they are with this. This was easy versus going in person. 


## Emotional & Cognitive Load Assessment

After completing the form, use these probes:

- "Did the length or complexity of the form feel manageable?" *About right. The person receiving the questions, the information made sense. 
- "Were there any questions that felt intrusive or insensitive?" *No, everything seemed questions that were necessary. 
- "Would you feel comfortable completing this on your own, or would you want help or support?" * I would complete it on my own. 
  - "What additional information, help, or support would have made this process easier for you?"
- "Is there anything you wish were available on this form or in the process?" *If you were sending this form to an executor, when you’re dealing with something as sensitive as this, make it more sensitive, preference this with some condolences. 

Moderator notes should track:
- Emotional shifts (frustration, hesitation, distress)
- Engagement level (focused vs. distracted)
- Confidence statements ("I think..." vs. "I'm not sure...")

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could identify you.
   - **If yes:** Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
