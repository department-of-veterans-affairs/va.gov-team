# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **[NAME]** and **[NOTETAKER NAME]** is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about how the VA is developing a new digital way for families and representatives to schedule burials for Veterans at national cemeteries.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any criticism.
  
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way.
  
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you comfortable with observers joining?** *Yes.
   - <mark>**If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.</mark>
   - **If yes:** Admit observers.
     
> [!TIP]
> - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
> - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
     
- *(If applicable)* **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.
  
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings will be deleted.
   - **Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
     
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across VA is by showing short video clips. If you agree, we would only share clips that don’t include any identifying information.
   - **Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?** *Yes. 
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

➡️ **Start recording.**

> [!TIP]
> After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? *Yes.

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
 
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** *Yes.

# Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. "Have you previously scheduled a burial? If yes, how did you do it?" *Yes, my husband.
2. "What was your experience like with that process? What worked well? *Initially through the funeral home, it was the first contact, in person. 
   What was frustrating?" *It was flawless. Losing a loved one and going into a funeral home the next day was tough, but it worked great going in there. 

# Usability Actions & Ratings

I am going to give you a scenario. You will then fill out the form as if you were this person, and complete a few taks in the prototype.
For each of the following actions, please attempt the task as you naturally would. After each, I’ll ask you to rate how easy or difficult it was.

Scenarios (alternating with each session)

**You are Bram Stoker, a funeral home representative. You are applying to schedule a burial for a deceased Veteran named Jonathon Harker.**

or

**You are Jonathon Harker, a Veteran with VA benefits. You are applying to schedule a burial for your deceased spouse, Mina Harker.**
*Is the DD214 going to be available? Some people would not have that available. 
*I had gotten permission for him to be buried in a national cemetery before he died. That’s something we both did. 
*I like that you have the option to finish later. 
*I don’t know what a pre-need letter is. I get it now, that might be the social security number or eligibility letter. Yes, it would be ( more clear if phrased differently). 
---

## Action 1: Determining your relationship to the Veteran

- Please indicate your relationship to the Veteran.

**Rating:**  
On a scale of 1 (very difficult) to 5 (very easy), how would you rate the ease of determining and selecting your relationship to the Veteran?

1. "Did any of the labels or terms confuse you?" 
2. "What did the label "personal representative" mean to you?" *To me that is the person scheduling the service, not the funeral director. As Bram Stoker, that is not very clear. Maybe it should say something different. 
   *VA file terminology confusing? *No. 
<mark>**[Record rating and comments here]**</mark>

> [!NOTE]
> Things to watch for:
- Does participant understand all relationship options?
- Do they click on the "Personal Representative" accordion for definition?
- Do they hesitate on which option applies to them?
- Is the list comprehensive for their situation?
- Usage of additional help within the form, such as help components, information accordians, or external links

---

## Action 2: Entering a Veteran service period

- Please enter a Veteran service period using the interface provided.
*The Veteran's marital status would be widowed if person is deceased. 

**Rating:**  
On a scale of 1 (very difficult) to 5 (very easy), how would you rate the ease of entering a Veteran service period? *Easy if I had his DD214 in front of me. I would rate it a 4. A funeral home will have the paperwork in front of them. I gave it a 4 because I may not have that paperwork in front of me. 
<mark>**[Record rating and comments here]**</mark>

[If participant hesitates]: "Use your best estimate if you're not certain."
[After entry]: "How confident are you that you entered the correct dates?"

> [!NOTE]
> Things to watch for:
> - Did the participant understand what was being asked?
> - Did they encounter any points of confusion?
> - Did they make errors or need to ask for clarification?
> - Did they find the field labels clear?
> - Did they complete the action without help?

---

## Action 3: Finding a preferred national cemetery

- Please find and select a preferred national cemetery.
*The person's eligibility would be the deceased not the spouse. I’m reading that as the Veteran itself. If the deceased is already buried or another person with his information. 
*Again, I don’t know what that mean. That’s confusing. (Previous family burial details tab). T That state as written is confusing to me. 
**Rating:**  
On a scale of 1 (very difficult) to 5 (very easy), how would you rate the ease of finding a preferred national cemetery? *5, easy 
<mark>**[Record rating and comments here]**</mark>
Task: Please indicate your preferred national cemetery for this burial.
[Context]: "The deceased Veteran's family prefers to be buried in their home state."

Things to watch for:
- Does participant understand they're selecting a specific cemetery? - Do they use search/filter vs. browse the list?
- If cemetery options are limited/unavailable, how do they respond?
- Understanding of what "national cemetery" means?
- Difficulty with state selection or cemetery availability?
- How do they know which cemetery to choose?

Post-task probe:
- "How would you know which cemetery to select?" *Would hope to where the closest one is as a final resting place. 

- "What if the preferred cemetery wasn't available?" *I would look around for the next, nearest one. 
*The paperwork I filled out for my husband was a whole different page to fill that out (emblems). This would be nice to have it here.
*What would it matter if convictions? I did not know that they can be buried there if convicted.  

*If we are burying a dependent of the Veteran but you don’t need the discharge documentation. 
*Let me expand this to review it.

## Overall Ease of Use

After you’ve completed these actions, on a scale of 1 to 5, how easy or difficult did you find using this part of the website overall? *4, because of the confusing questions we talked about. 
<mark>**[Record overall rating and comments here]**</mark>

# Post-Task Interview - 8 minutes
- "What do you think happens now after you submit the form?" * It goes to the VA and see if there is room in the end. I can imagine 60 days/ 6 weeks to hear back. 
- "What part of the process felt most overwhelming or confusing?" *Really, nothing. It was very clear besides those few now that I have gone through it myself. Too much stress for family to deal with it after. 
- "Were there any parts of this form that you found to be unclear? *Besides what we already talked about,no. 
- "Compared to calling the VA or an in-person visit, how would this compare?" * Very easy. I prefer to do it in person. Doing it online I’m satisfied and I would follow up with the funeral home. 


## Emotional & Cognitive Load Assessment

After completing the form, use these probes:

- "Did the length or complexity of the form feel manageable?" *Absolutely. Even if I had to stop, I could have saved and come back. 
- "Were there any questions that felt intrusive or insensitive?" *No, not all.
- "Would you feel comfortable completing this on your own, or would you want help or support?" *I would do it on my own, as a perspective of a person doing it for the first time doing it, I would want the help of someone else. 
  - "What additional information, help, or support would have made this process easier for you?" *No. Maybe just one thing, maybe religion for the headstone, I know I had to get another form to choose what words on his stone. Maybe add a religious symbol that came from the funeral home itself. 
- "Is there anything you wish was available on this form or in the process?"

Moderator notes should track:
- Emotional shifts (frustration, hesitation, distress)
- Engagement level (focused vs. distracted)
- Confidence statements ("I think..." vs. "I'm not sure...")

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could identify you.
   - **If yes:** Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
