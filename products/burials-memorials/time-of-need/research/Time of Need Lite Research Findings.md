## Research Goals
Findings will inform iterative improvements to the form's design, content, and workflow. Insights will be used to optimize the user experience, prioritize accessibility and clarity, and refine the MVP for public launch. User feedback will directly influence next-phase feature development and business process alignment.
[See the Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)  

1. **Evaluate the usability and accessibility of the Time of Need Lite digital form for scheduling a burial.**

2. **Identify pain points and barriers that Veterans' family members, personal representatives, and funeral home staff experience when using the form.**

3. **Gauge user satisfaction with the digital experience compared to the current phone-based process.**

**Guiding Questions:**  
- What are the key moments this tool supports in the Veteran’s journey? 
- What outcomes are we aiming to achieve for Veterans and stakeholders?  

[Example Research Goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#research-goals) 

## Research Questions

*List the research questions that guided this study.*  

*1. Can users complete and submit a burial scheduling request without confusion or errors?*

*2. What information or steps do users find unclear or challenging in the form?*

*3. How does the digital process compare to the phone-based process in terms of efficiency and emotional burden for users?*

*4. Are there accessibility challenges or barriers for users with disabilities?*

*5. What additional features or support do users wish were available in the digital form?*

## Methodology 

*Provide a brief description of the research methods used (e.g., usability testing, interviews).*  

We conducted remote moderated research sessions that included usability testing to evaluate the user experience and gather actionable feedback.


[Example Methodology](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#methodology)


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

*List hypotheses explored in the research and the conclusions drawn. If applicable, list the success or task completion rate.*

- **Hypothesis Statement:**
  
- **Primary Hypothesis:** Users will be able to complete and submit the burial request form digitally with fewer errors and less stress than the current phone-based process. Most usability issues will stem from unfamiliar terminology or unclear instructions, and accessibility improvements may be needed for specific cohorts. Digital submission will be perceived as more convenient and less emotionally taxing.
  **LIKELY TRUE** - Participants overall gave feedback saying the digital form was less stressful and more streamlined. However, we cannot determine if the participants would have had less errors without our guidance completing the form on their own. 
- **Contrasting Hypothesis:** Certain participant segments (e.g., Veterans aged 65+, those with disabilities, or those without reliable internet access) may find the phone-based process more accessible or less stressful than the digital form. This is informed by prior VSO research and medallion form desk research (see Section 9), which found that older Veterans often prefer verbal guidance and that some participants encounter barriers with digital-only options.
  **NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION** - Multiple participants in the study who were over the age of 65 said they would prefer the online form vs. being on the phone. However, no participants in the study had disabilities and all had reliable internet access. 
- **Form Completion Time Hypothesis:** Most users will complete the digital form in 10–15 minutes. However, family members or representatives unfamiliar with military terminology or VA processes may require 20+ minutes to complete all required fields.
   **LIKELY TRUE** - Most participants completed the form in an average of 20+ minutes. This may be influenced by the fact that the moderators were pausing participants frequently to ask research questions. 
  
  - **"Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”**  
  - Supporting evidence

## Key Findings

*Summarize the 5–10 most impactful findings from your study.* 

[Example Key Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#key-findings)

1. Users had difficulty interpreting the terminology used in the question, “What is your relationship to the Veteran (deceased)?”​
​​
2. Some users were familiar with the concept of the pre-need decision letter but didn't recognize terminology. Others were unaware of what the letter was and have never done it before.
   ​
3. Most users understood the definition of personal representative, but few understood its relation to their specific scenario.​​
​
4. Users were wanting better context and more functionality when selecting a preferred cemetery. Some users were unsure of all the options and resources available to them.​
​
5. Users expressed confusion regarding burial terminology, notably ​"cremains green", "intact green", and "cremains". 

## Details of Findings 

*Provide detailed descriptions and supporting evidence for each key finding.*  
> **TIP:** For details on how to write descriptive links that are accessible to assistive technology users, see Platform documentation on [How to create accessible GitHub Markdown files](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/how-to-create-accessible-github-markdown-files).

### Finding 1
Users had difficulty interpreting the terminology used in the question, “What is your relationship to the Veteran (deceased)?”
- Supporting data:
- (Regarding the term Sponsor) "and this is a military term, I think some people might not know, if they were, like, a family member, might not know that a sponsor means, like, the primary Person with the, you know, and others are dependents." - P5
- "I could be either the spouse, or the representative spouse, or whatever in that sense." - P6

### Finding 2  
Some users were familiar with the concept of the pre-need decision letter but didn't recognize terminology. Others were unaware of what the letter was and have never done it before.​
- Supporting data:
- "I have (a pre-need decision letter) myself, but I didn't know it was called pre-need. That sounds like you need something. That's kind of poorly titled, to be honest with you." - P7
- "It's just not clear to me, what they're asking for, but I realize now that must be the social security number of the eligibility or existing letter from the VA, correct?" - P11

### Finding 3  
Most users understood the definition of personal representative, but few understood its relation to their specific scenario.
- Supporting data:
- (Regarding who is the personal rep) "to me...that would be the wife who was doing it on my behalf. To me, the personal representative is not the actual veteran, it's the person who's caring for the veteran, because the veteran's unable to care for themselves." - P13
- "I would assume it would be, like, a legal representative, or it would be a family member who has been… who's gotten power of attorney." - P5

### Finding 4
Users were wanting better context and more functionality when selecting a preferred cemetery. Some users were unsure of all the options and resources available to them.​
- Supporting data:
- "Can I go to any of those cemeteries? Or does it have to be somewhere near me, near the deceased?" - P2
- (regarding picking a national cemetery) "So, I personally didn't know that anybody can basically, you know, pick any of them, and I just was like, well, which one's closest to my town? Now, later on, I learned that you can pick any of them. So, I did not have that information available." - P13

### Finding 5
Users expressed confusion regarding burial terminology, particularly with the terms "cremains green," "intact green," and "cremains."
- Supporting data:
- "Just the part on the cremation. I don't know what green cremate… I don't know if that's more eco-friendly. ... I just remember being asked, do you want a casket or a cremation?" - P4
- "I don't know what intact green and cream means green. I don't know what that is." - P2

## Additional Insights
*Include insights that do not represent patterns but are still valuable.*  

- Users were aware of the required documents that they needed to upload or use to fill out the form. There were strong acknowledgments of having all of the required documents ready before starting the form.​
​
- Some users were surprised to learn that criminal history could affect eligibility for burial, or other benefits, even after service with an honorable discharge. ​
​
- When describing overall length of the form, the consensus was that the form was long, but the questions asked were necessary. The experience was about comparable to other VA.gov forms.
  
- Some users found the term "eligibility" unclear. Additionally, the distinction between existing and new burials was not always evident, leading some users to unintentionally begin a case as a new burial instead of a subsequent burial.
## Recommendations

*Summarize actionable recommendations based on findings.*  

1. **Recommendation:** ​
Review and clarify the “Relationship to Deceased” question. Offer more specific options or enable multiple selections to accommodate diverse relationships.
   - Supporting evidence: 9 out of 14 participants hesitated when selecting their relationship to the deceased; some were uncertain which option best described their connection to the deceased, while others wanted the ability to choose more than one relationship type.
2. **Recommendation:**  Optimize the placement of the personal representative question. Assess where this question best fits within the user flow for clarity and effectiveness.
   - Supporting evidence: 8 out of 14 participants were confident with the definition of "personal representative," but few expressed confusion with giving the personal representatives information after they had already indicated that they were a family member or funeral home representative.​
4. **Recommendation:** Enhance supporting text for the pre-need decision letter. Collaborate to add clear descriptions explaining the letter’s role and relevance to the Time of Need burial scheduling process.
   - Supporting evidence: 6 out of 14 participants were unclear about the meaning of “pre-need decision letter.” 
6. **Recommendation:** Streamline cemetery selection guidance. Work together on solutions to better assist users when their preferred cemetery is unavailable.​
   - Supporting evidence: 9 out of 14 participants wanted expanded capabilities with cemetery selection, or were unaware of the features offered via the external link. 
7. **Recommendation:** ​Clarify terminology and context for cemetery options. Add explanations about each choice, including any cemetery-specific restrictions.
   - Supporting evidence: 6 out of 14 participants had questions about the unique burial types beyond the traditional "casket" or "cremation" selections.
8. **Recommendation:** ​Evaluate the relevance of the emblem of belief screen. Consider whether to ​keep this screen if there are no additional questions on headstones or markers.
   - Supporting evidence: 8 out of 14 users noted the form's length, even though most though it was on par with other VA.gov forms. Removing extraneous screens that don't add vital data can cut down on user time spent completing the form and overall user satisfaction.

## Product User and Business Outcomes

*Explain how findings and recommendations align with the product's goals.*

### Desired User Outcome 
This research supports our desired user outcome so that:
- Organizations can submit requests more effectively and efficiently, providing better service to their clients in a difficult time.
- Family members and personal representatives can easily request a burial through VA.gov – streamlining the process.
- Users can easily schedule a burial via computer or mobile phone, instead of calling in.
 
### Desired Business Outcome
This research supports our desired business outcome so that:
- The NCSO can provide the best possible experience for Veteran’s family members and representatives in a difficult time.
- Increased efficiency and accuracy with data input and processing.
- In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA.)
- Free up more time for NCSO agents by reducing need for manual entry of information.
- Build on VA.gov’s efforts to enhance digitization and convenience.


## Key Performance Indicators

*Explain how findings will support KPI measurement.*  

- **Percentage of ToN Requests Submitted via Self-Service:**  
  Findings will inform improvements to the form’s clarity and usability, helping to increase self-service submissions from 50% to over 70%.

- **Reduction in Call Center Volume for ToN Submissions:**  
  By identifying common user obstacles, we’ll enhance self-service guidance and reduce the need for call center support, targeting a 40% decrease in calls.

- **User Satisfaction Rating (Target 4+ out of 5):**  
  Research will guide specific enhancements to boost overall user satisfaction to at least 4 out of 5.

- **Successful Form Submission Rate (Target: 95%):**  
  Findings will help address pain points and errors, raising the form successful completion rate to 95%.

- **Average Submission Time (Target: <15 minutes):**  
  Process streamlining based on user feedback will support an average completion time of under 15 minutes.
  

## Next Steps

We will now prioritize the top problem areas identified in the study and begin collaborative solutioning. The team will discuss feasibility, develop practical updates and reflect these changes in updated designs or prototypes. Key actions and decisions will be tracked through implementation tickets to support transparency and accountability as we improve the Time of Need form experience.
