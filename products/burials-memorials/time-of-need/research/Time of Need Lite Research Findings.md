research_goals:
- 1. Evaluate the usability and accessibility of the Time of Need Lite digital form for scheduling a burial.

- 2. Identify pain points and barriers that Veterans' family members, personal representatives, and funeral home staff experience when using the form.

- 3. Gauge user satisfaction with the digital experience compared to the current phone-based process.

methodology:
  - Moderated usability testing via Microsoft Teams. Participants will be asked to schedule a burial for a Veteran, spouse, or dependent child using the Time of Need Lite prototype. This method is appropriate as it allows observation of user interactions, collection of real-time feedback, and facilitates accessibility accommodations.

# Time of Need Lite Research Findings 

**Office of the CTO - Digital Experience (OCTO-DE), Schedule a burial in a national cemetery, Memorials Self Service**

**Date:** 12/10/2025

## Research Goals
Findings will inform iterative improvements to the form's design, content, and workflow. Insights will be used to optimize the user experience, prioritize accessibility and clarity, and refine the MVP for public launch. User feedback will directly influence next-phase feature development and business process alignment.
[See the Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)  

**Guiding Questions:**  
- What are the key moments this tool supports in the Veteran’s journey? 
- What outcomes are we aiming to achieve for Veterans and stakeholders?  

[Example Research Goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#research-goals) 

## Research Questions

*List the research questions that guided this study.*  

*1. Can users complete and submit a burial scheduling request without confusion or errors?*

*2. What information or steps do users find unclear or challenging in the form?*

*3. How does the digital process compare to the phone-based process in terms of efficiency and emotional burden for users?*

*4. Are there accessibility challenges or barriers for users with disabilities?*

*5. What additional features or support do users wish were available in the digital form?*

## Methodology 

*Provide a brief description of the research methods used (e.g., usability testing, interviews).*  

- Method 1: We conducted remote moderated research sessions that included usability testing to evaluate the user experience and gather actionable feedback.


[Example Methodology](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#methodology)


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

*List hypotheses explored in the research and the conclusions drawn. If applicable, list the success or task completion rate.*

> [!TIP]
> Place true or false statements in bold for easier scanability

- **Hypothesis Statement:**
  
- **Primary Hypothesis:** Users will be able to complete and submit the burial request form digitally with fewer errors and less stress than the current phone-based process. Most usability issues will stem from unfamiliar terminology or unclear instructions, and accessibility improvements may be needed for specific cohorts. Digital submission will be perceived as more convenient and less emotionally taxing.
- i. MAYBE TRUE - Participants overall gave feedback saying the digital form was less stressful and more streamlined. However, we cannot determine if the participants would have had less errors without our guidance completing the form on their own. 
- **Contrasting Hypothesis:** Certain participant segments (e.g., Veterans aged 65+, those with disabilities, or those without reliable internet access) may find the phone-based process more accessible or less stressful than the digital form. This is informed by prior VSO research and medallion form desk research (see Section 9), which found that older Veterans often prefer verbal guidance and that some participants encounter barriers with digital-only options.
- i. NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION - Multiple participants in the study who were over the age of 65 said they would prefer the online form vs. being on the phone. However, no participants in the study had disabilities and all had reliable internet access. 
- **Form Completion Time Hypothesis:** Most users will complete the digital form in 10–15 minutes. However, family members or representatives unfamiliar with military terminology or VA processes may require 20+ minutes to complete all required fields.
- i. LIKELY TRUE - Most participants completed the form in an average of 20+ minutes. This may be influenced by the fact that the moderators were pausing participants frequently to ask research questions. 
  
  - **"Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”**  
  - Supporting evidence  

[Example Hypotheses and Conclusions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#hypotheses-and-conclusions)


## Key Findings

*Summarize the 5–10 most impactful findings from your study.* 

> [!TIP] 
> Write findings as stand-alone insights that are easy to scan. For example:  
> - "Most participants used the search field to locate forms, often searching for 'veteran health.'"  
> - "Participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form."  

[Example Key Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#key-findings)

1. Users experienced confusion with terminology when asked "What is your relationship to the Veteran (deceased)?"
2. Most users understood the definition of "personal representative". However, few understood its relation to their specific scenario in the form. 
3. Some users were confused with "eligibility" terminology used prior to the previous burials section. There was confusion about existing burials - some users might unintentionally start a case as a new burial rather than a subsequent one.
4. Users were wanting better context and more functionality when selecting a preferred cemetery. Some users were unsure of all of the options/resources available to them.
5. Users expressed confusion regarding burial terminology, notably "cremains green", "intact green", and "cremains". 
6. When describing the overall length of the form, users agreed that the form was quite long but the questions asked were necessary.
7. Majority of users found the form to be manageable, straightforward, and easy to use. The average rating out of 5 was a 4.5.
8. Issues users encountered during the study could be alleviated by adding to or changing description text on some screens.
