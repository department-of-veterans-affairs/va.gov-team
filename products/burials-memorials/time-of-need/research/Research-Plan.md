# Research Plan for BAH-MBS-SelfServ, Time of Need Lite, [July 2025]

## Background üèóÔ∏è
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary> 

  
**To develop a secure, user-friendly digital form accessible via both web and mobile platforms on VA.gov. This form will allow authorized individuals and organizations to submit burial requests electronically, streamlining the initiation process with the NCSO**

`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

**Currently, there is no way for family members, authorized organizations, or personal representatives to initiate a burial request for a deceased Veteran, spouse, or dependent child through VA.gov. They must call the National Cemetery Scheduling Office (NCSO) directly, resulting in longer processing times and added stress for families and representatives during a difficult time. Time of Need Lite aims to provide a secure, user-friendly digital form on VA.gov for submitting burial requests electronically, streamlining the process.**
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

**Time of Need Lite will be accessible via both web and mobile platforms on VA.gov, both authenticated and unauthenticated services (to allow family, friends, funeral homes, and representatives to access and submit requests).**

`What is Veterans‚Äô familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

**This is a new product; there is currently no digital self-service option for initiating burial requests through VA.gov. Veterans and their families have previously interacted only by phone, so this tool is new to them.**

## Research Goals ü•Ö	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

> [!NOTE]
> Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.

### Goals

`1.` **Evaluate the usability and accessibility of the Time of Need Lite digital form for scheduling a burial.**

`2.` **Identify pain points and barriers that Veterans' family members, personal representatives, and funeral home staff experience when using the form.**

`3.` **Gauge user satisfaction with the digital experience compared to the current phone-based process.**
  
### Outcome
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

---

**Findings will inform iterative improvements to the form's design, content, and workflow. Insights will be used to optimize the user experience, prioritize accessibility and clarity, and refine the MVP for public launch. User feedback will directly influence next-phase feature development and business process alignment.**

---

### Research questions

**`1.` Can users complete and submit a burial scheduling request without confusion or errors?**

**`2.` What information or steps do users find unclear or challenging in the form?**

**`3.` How does the digital process compare to the phone-based process in terms of efficiency and emotional burden for users?**

**`4.` Are there accessibility challenges or barriers for users with disabilities?**

**`5.` What additional features or support do users wish were available in the digital form?**

### Hypotheses

---
-  **Primary hypothis** Users will be able to complete and submit the burial request form digitally with fewer errors and less stress than the current phone-based process. Most usability issues will stem from unfamiliar terminology or unclear instructions, and accessibility improvements may be needed for specific cohorts. Digital submission will be perceived as more convenient and less emotionally taxing.**

- **Contrasting Hypothesis:** Certain participant segments (e.g., Veterans aged 65+, those with disabilities, or those without reliable internet access) may find the phone-based process more accessible or less stressful than the digital form. This is informed by prior VSO research and medallion form desk research (see Section 9), which found that older Veterans often prefer verbal guidance and that some participants encounter barriers with digital-only options.

- **Supporting Data:** This hypothesis is grounded in desk research on burial benefits, including VSO findings regarding barriers to digital access and feedback from the medallion form research, which highlighted confusion with terminology and the need for support among first-time users. (See Section 9: Desk Research Summary.)

- **Form Completion Time Hypothesis:** Most users will complete the digital form in 10‚Äì15 minutes. However, family members or representatives unfamiliar with military terminology or VA processes may require 20+ minutes to complete all required fields.

---

## Methodology  üõ†Ô∏è

**Moderated usability testing via Microsoft Teams. Participants will be asked to schedule a burial for a Veteran, spouse, or dependent child using the Time of Need Lite prototype. This method is appropriate as it allows observation of user interactions, collection of real-time feedback, and facilitates accessibility accommodations.**

- ## Decision-Making, Prioritization, and Iteration üîÑ

### Prioritization of Findings

- Findings from usability research will be prioritized using the **MoSCoW framework** ("Must have," "Should have," "Could have," "Won't have") and an **impact/effort matrix**. The product and research teams will collaboratively assess each identified issue or insight to determine its urgency, value to users, and feasibility within project constraints. Highest-priority issues (Must haves, high-impact/low-effort) will be addressed first in design and development sprints.

### Iteration Cycles & Post-Launch Validation

- Iterative improvement cycles will be adopted: Insights from initial usability testing will drive targeted design revisions and further prototype refinement.

- ### Sharing Insights & Cross-Team Collaboration

- Research findings, reports, and actionable recommendations will be shared across the burials ecosystem, including other teams referenced in desk research (e.g., NCA, VEO, platform and policy partners), through:
  - Written synthesis reports and presentations delivered at cross-team meetings
  - Posting insights and documentation in shared VA.gov repositories and burials-memorials channels
  - Collaborative workshops or debriefs to discuss key findings and implications across related products and workflows
