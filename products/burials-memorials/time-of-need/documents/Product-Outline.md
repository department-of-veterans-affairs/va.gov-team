# Product Outline - Time of Need Lite Self Service

## Overview
To develop a secure, user-friendly digital form accessible via both web and mobile platforms on VA.gov. This form will allow authorized individuals and organizations to submit burial requests electronically, streamlining the initiation process with the NCSO.

## Problem Statement
Currently, there is no way for family members, authorized organizations or personal representatives to initiate a burial request for a deceased Veteran, their spouses, and dependent children through VA.gov, which is required to begin the process with the National Cemetery Scheduling Office (NCSO). Instead, they must call the NCSO directly to access this benefit. This lack of a digital option can lead to longer processing times for funeral homes and adds unnecessary stress and complexity for grieving families and representatives during an already difficult time.

## Desired User Outcomes

**Why would a user want to use this?**
- Organizations can submit requests more effectively and efficiently, providing better service to their clients in a difficult time.
- Family members and personal representatives can easily request a burial through VA.gov – streamlining the process.
- Users can easily schedule a burial via computer or mobile phone, instead of calling in.

**With this problem solved, what should users be able to do or achieve that they couldn't before?**
- Organizations (funeral homes, VSOs or cemeteries) will save time and labor. Representatives will no longer need to call the NCSO to submit interment requests.
- Family members or personal representatives can submit a request digitally in their own homes, without having to talk to anyone.
- Requests can be submitted at any time.
- Users are able pause the application if they need more time to gather information or make decisions.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Longer time to create interment requests.
- Inability to use the form without calling the NCSO for assistance.

## Desired Business Outcomes

**Why would your business want this to exist?**
- The NCSO wants to provide the best possible experience for Veteran’s family members and representatives in a difficult time.
- Increased efficiency and accuracy with data input and processing.
- In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA.)
- Free up more time for NCSO agents by reducing need for manual entry of information.
- Build on VA.gov’s efforts to enhance digitization and convenience.

**With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do or achieve that it couldn't before?**
- It will improve data accuracy with less manual entry.
- It will reduce call hold times, improving overall user experience.

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Increased processing times.
- Decreased satisfaction with NCSO and VA.gov services.

## Measuring Success - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

**What data will you look at to evaluate success?**
- User feedback ratings
- Form processing time
- Submission and error metrics
- Session completion
- Surveys on NCSO feedback
- Comparative metrics between CaMEO MBMS and VA.gov

**Most important KPIs:**
- Feedback ratings
- Processing time
- Submission metrics
- Open form metrics
- Error analysis

Dashboard/report links: TBD   
Baseline KPI values: 

- Percentage of ToN requests submitted via self-service (initial: 50%, target: 70%+)
- Reduction in call center volume for ToN submissions (initial: 20%+, target: 40%+ reduction)
- User satisfaction rating (target: 4+ out of 5)
- Successful form submission rate (target: 95%)
- Average submission time (target: <15 minutes)

## Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

**What are the measurable targets?**
- TBD (work with MBMS for baseline metrics and average form completion benchmarks)
- Objective: TBD
- Key Results: TBD

## Assumptions
- NCSO must implement a new intake model.
- Initial launch likely to be a phased rollout, with a “lite” version of the form used as a baseline to build from.

## Solution Approach

**What are you building and why?**
- A form on VA.gov for Veteran family members, personal representatives, funeral homes, cemeteries, and other authorized organizations to request burial services at the Veteran’s time of need.
- Options to choose preferred service date and time slots.
- Include specific interment details (casket/urn measurements, liner, emblem).

**What won’t be included in this release?**
- Selecting a specific burial time and date
- Verifying service options by cemetery

**How will it evolve?**
- Case status updates
- Ability to select specific scheduling times and dates with updates in real time
- UX design improvements based on user feedback
