## Troubleshooting

### Errors and Metrics


### Issue investigation steps
- Errors that may arise are investigated and would be documented into a story to find fixes for the cause of the error.

### Flipper Features and Rollback
There is no flipper feature, we will use the vagovprod flag in the registry file in the content build repo to handle any rollbacks.

## Security
descibe any security concerns the responders should be aware, for example: Does your product have PII? Do you log senstive information that needs to be handled in a particular manner? Does your product have a known security vulnerability that has been accepted by leadership? etc.

Product uses PII and that PII is scrubbed in cases of errors as not to display PII.
