 
### Outcome 
 
These learnings will allow us to evaluate the Medallions digital form and its functionality for future iterations on related forms, such as the application for a Standard Government Headstones or Marker (VA Form 40-1330), ensuring the design meets VA.gov Design System standards. We hope to provide users with the simplest, and most efficient process when ordering a medallion and coordinating multiple signatures. Research findings and recommendations will be synthesized to determine what pain points there are for our users, and if there are any blockers to consider. 
 
### Research questions 
 
Are users adequately equipped to begin this form, ensuring confidence throughout its completion? 
Does the content adhere to the most intuitive and user-friendly experience? 
What specific sections of our form pose the greatest challenges for users? 
Is the form’s structure proficient in guiding users through the process? 
Does the organization and content provided help guide the users step-by-step? 
What can we do to streamline the information for users to make it clearer and easier to understand? 
What questions do users have before and after completing the form? 
 
 
 
### Hypothesis 
 
Our hypothesis is that users might: 

Understand the language used to differentiate between applicant and Veteran 
Find the form straight to the point and user friendly 
Be able to move through the form and ultimately order a medallion for the Veteran quickly and with ease 
Spend less time reading and more time getting through questions quickly based on conciseness 
Understand the requirements needed to apply for a medallion and multiple signatures 
Experience confusion on who is eligible for this benefit 
Have questions about what happens after they apply and how the multiple signature process works 
 
 
## Methodology	 
 
Moderated usability testing using a mobile prototype – appropriate for evaluative research. 
 
### Location 
 
Remote testing with Zoom as the preferred video conferencing software.

### Recruitment approach 
We’d like to recruit 10 participants for a total of 8 completed sessions. We’ll use Perigean to recruit participants. 
 
### Recruitment criteria 
 
**Primary criteria (must-haves) ** 
- Amount: Target is 8 participants but recruit 10 
- Age ranges:  
    * Around 70% 55+ - 7 participants 
    * Around 20% 35+ - 2 participants 
    * Around 10% 18-34 - 1 participant 
- Types:  
    * Three to four spouses or surviving spouses of a service member of Veteran (A **spouse** is a person who is or was legally married to a service member or Veteran. A **surviving spouse** is someone who was legally married to the service member or Veteran at the time of their death and includes a surviving spouse who remarried.) 
    * Two or three personal representatives (a person filling out the medallions form that is connected to the Veteran, called the applicant.) 
    * One parent of a service member 
    * Six to eight people interested in getting a medallion for a privately purchased marker 
    * We would like to emphasize recruiting more from the following underserved communities: 
        * Identify as Biracial, Asian, Black, or LGBTQ+  
*Biracial - 1 participant 
*Asian - 1 participant	 
*Asian - 1 participant 
*Black - 1 participant 
*LGBTQ+ - 1 participant 
    * Nice to haves:   
        * Live in rural areas or abroad 
        * Other than honorable 
        * Immigrant origin 
        * Have cognitive disabilities  
- Participants must be able to use Zoom, locate and use the chat function in Zoom, and to share their screen through Zoom 
- At least 3-4 people who will use a mobile device during the research session (tablet is ok too) 
  
 **Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves) ** 
None. 
 
**Screener questions to target criteria not captured in the recruitment sign-up survey: ** 

1. Which of the following describes your relationship to a Veteran? 

- I am their spouse or surviving spouse (A spouse is a person who is or was legally married to a service member or Veteran. A surviving spouse is someone who was legally married to the Veteran at the time of their death and includes a surviving spouse who remarried.)  
- I am a family member of the Veteran  
- I am a Veteran Service Officer  
- I am a Veteran’s personal representative (a person filling out the Medallions form on behalf of the deceased) 
- I am a parent of a servicemember 
- None of the above, but I am interested in applying for a medallion for someone else
  
2. Have you applied or tried to apply for a Medallions eligibility determination at least once in the last 12 months? 
- If yes, go to question 4. 
- If no, go to question 3. 
 
3. Are you interested in applying for a Medallions eligibility determination on behalf of a Veteran? 
- If yes, go to question 4. 
- If no, disqualify.
  
4. Do you need to use assistive technology to use the internet such as VoiceOver on an iPhone, TalkBack on an Android device, or JAWS on a  computer?
- Proceed to question 4a if yes. Proceed to 4c if no.  

4a. Are you able to join the Zoom session using this assistive  
technology?  
- Answer should be yes to satisfy criteria for screen reader. 
4b. Please list the name of the assistive technology or software you will use during the session. 
4c. Are you able to join the Zoom session from a smart phone such as a Samsung Galaxy or Apple iPhone? 
- Any kind of smart phone will work, as long as it connects to the internet. Tablet is ok, too.  
- Answer should be yes for 3-4 users to satisfy criteria for mobile testing.  The other half should be on desktop devices.
