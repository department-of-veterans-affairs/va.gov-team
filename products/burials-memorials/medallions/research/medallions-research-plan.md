# Research Plan for MBMS Self-Service Team, Claim for Government Medallion to Affix to a Private Marker (VA Form 40-1330M), March 2024

## Background

The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) is working to modernize its systems, including the system that processes medallion applications (Form 40-1330M) for determining eligibility for a government medallion to affix to a private marker (VA Form 40-1330M). Currently, family members, VSO officers, and personal representatives do not have a digitized form that allows them to request a medallion for a Veteran buried in a private cemetery with a privately purchased headstone or marker. The lack of digitized form also makes the process for getting a medallion a longer and larger level of effort for NCA officials. 

The paper form application for a medallion is available for eligible Veterans and is accessible through the Veterans, Headstones, and Markers static page  on VA.gov. 

We will be conducting usability testing using interactive designs of a new Medallions form to ensure it meets the needs of VA.gov users and that it can provide NCSO analysts with clean, accurate data.

### OCTO Priorities 

The [OCTO objectives] ( https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) that this research supports are to:
1.	Solidify the VA.gov platform
2.	Enhance Veteran’s personalized online experience
3.	Drive OIT’s Digital Transformation Strategy

### Veteran Journey

This product fits into the [Veteran journey] (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) for the following areas: 

The Medallions application applies to life stage of Dying, as Veteran’s family members, personal representatives, or Veteran Service Officers can apply for a medallion to affix to a private marker in a private cemetery at the time of death – or at any point after the Veteran’s death.

## Research goals

The goals of this research study are to:

Goal 1: Design a form that is straightforward and inclusive of the information needed to determine eligibility for a medallion.

Goal 2: Test the usability of the medallions digital form solution to ensure that it is easily usable and accessible for applicants.

Goal 3: Identify pain points that may hinder user’s ability to complete the form, confirming users understand the application process thoroughly from beginning to end.


### Outcome

These learnings will allow us to evaluate the Medallions digital form and its functionality for future iterations on related forms, such as the application for a Standard Government Headstones or Marker (VA Form 40-1330), ensuring the design meets VA.gov Design System standards. We hope to provide users with the simplest, and most efficient process when ordering a medallion. Research findings and recommendations will be synthesized to determine what pain points there are for our users, and if there are any blockers to consider.

### Research questions

•	Are users adequately equipped to begin this form, ensuring confidence throughout its completion?

•	Does the content adhere to the most intuitive and user-friendly experience?

•	What specific sections of our form pose the greatest challenges for users?

•	Is the form’s structure proficient in guiding users through the process?

•	Does the organization and content provided help guide the users step-by-step?

•	What can we do to streamline the information for users to make it clearer and easier to understand? 

•	What questions do users have before and after completing the form? 




### Hypothesis

Our hypothesis is that users might:

•	Understand the language used to differentiate between applicant and Veteran

•	Find the form straight to the point and user friendly

•	Be able to move through the form and ultimately order a medallion for the Veteran quickly and with ease

•	Spend less time reading and more time getting through questions quickly based on conciseness

•	Will understand the requirements needed to apply for a medallion

•	Experience confusion on who is eligible for this benefit

•	Have questions about what happens after they apply


## Methodology	

Moderated usability testing using a mobile prototype – appropriate for evaluative research.

### Location

Remote testing with Zoom as the preferred video conferencing software.

### Recruitment approach
We’d like to recruit 10 participants for a total of 8 completed sessions. We’ll use Perigean to recruit participants.

### Recruitment criteria

**Primary criteria (must-haves) **
- Amount: Target is 8 participants but recruit 10
- Age ranges: 
    * Around 70% 55+ - 7 participants
    * Around 20% 35+ - 2 participants
    * Around 10% 18-34 - 1 participant
- Types: 
    * Three to four spouses or surviving spouses of a service member of Veteran (A **spouse** is a person who is or was legally married to a service member or Veteran. A **surviving spouse** is someone who was legally married to the service member or Veteran at the time of their death and includes a surviving spouse who remarried.)
    * Two or three personal representatives (a person filling out the medallions form that is connected to the Veteran, called the applicant.)
    * One parent of a service member
    * Six to eight people interested in getting a medallion for a privately purchased marker
    * We would like to emphasize recruiting more from the following underserved communities:

        * Have cognitive disabilities 
- Participants must be able to use Zoom, locate and use the chat function in Zoom, and to share their screen through Zoom
- At least 3-4 people who will use a mobile device during the research session (tablet is ok too)
 
 **Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves) **
None.

**Screener questions to target criteria not captured in the recruitment sign-up survey: **
