# Research Plan for MBMS Self-Service Team, Claim for Government Medallion to Affix to a Private Marker (VA Form 40-1330M), October 2024 
 
## Background 
 
The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) is working to modernize its systems, including the system that processes medallion applications (Form 40-1330M) for determining eligibility for a government medallion to affix to a private marker (VA Form 40-1330M). Currently, family members, VSO officers, funeral homes, cemeteries, and personal representatives do not have a digitized form that allows them to request a medallion for a Veteran buried in a private cemetery with a privately purchased headstone or marker. As the form is now, the applicant must gather the cemetery and medallion recipient’s signatures. The lack of a digitized form  makes the process for getting a medallion a longer and larger level of effort for NCA officials.  
 
The paper form application for a medallion is available for eligible Veterans and is accessible through the Veterans, Headstones, and Markers static page  on VA.gov.  
 
We will be conducting usability testing using interactive designs of a new Medallions form, and with a solution for multiple signatures. This is to ensure it meets the needs of VA.gov users, and that it can provide NCSO analysts with clean, accurate data.

### OCTO Priorities  
 
The [OCTO objectives]( https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) that this research supports are to: 
- Solidify the VA.gov platform 
- Enhance Veteran’s personalized online experience 
- Drive OIT’s Digital Transformation Strategy 
- Increase usage of digital, self-service tools  
 
### Veteran Journey 
 
This product fits into the [Veteran journey]( https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) for the following areas:  
 
The Medallions application applies to life stage of Dying, as Veteran’s family members, personal representatives, or Veteran Service Officers can apply for a medallion to affix to a private marker in a private cemetery at the time of death – or at any point after the Veteran’s death. 
 
## Research goals 
 
The goals of this research study are to: 
 
- Goal 1: Design a form that is straightforward and inclusive of the information needed to determine eligibility for a medallion. 
 
- Goal 2: Test the usability of the medallions digital form and multiple signature solution to ensure that it is easily usable and accessible for applicants. 
 
- Goal 3: Identify pain points that may hinder user’s ability to complete the form and multiple signature solution, confirming users understand the application process thoroughly from beginning to end. 
 
 
### Outcome 
 
These learnings will allow us to evaluate the Medallions digital form and its functionality for future iterations on related forms, such as the application for a Standard Government Headstones or Marker (VA Form 40-1330), ensuring the design meets VA.gov Design System standards. We hope to provide users with the simplest, and most efficient process when ordering a medallion and coordinating multiple signatures. Research findings and recommendations will be synthesized to determine what pain points there are for our users, and if there are any blockers to consider. 
 
### Research questions 
 
- Are users adequately equipped to begin this form, ensuring confidence throughout its completion? 
- Does the content adhere to the most intuitive and user-friendly experience? 
- What specific sections of our form pose the greatest challenges for users? 
- Is the form’s structure proficient in guiding users through the process? 
- Does the organization and content provided help guide the users step-by-step? 
- What can we do to streamline the information for users to make it clearer and easier to understand? 
- What questions do users have before and after completing the form? 
 
 
 
### Hypothesis 
 
Our hypothesis is that users might: 

- Understand the language used to differentiate between applicant and Veteran 
- Find the form straight to the point and user friendly 
- Be able to move through the form and ultimately order a medallion for the Veteran quickly and with ease 
- Spend less time reading and more time getting through questions quickly based on conciseness 
- Understand the requirements needed to apply for a medallion and multiple signatures 
- Experience confusion on who is eligible for this benefit 
- Have questions about what happens after they apply and how the multiple signature process works 
 
 
## Methodology
