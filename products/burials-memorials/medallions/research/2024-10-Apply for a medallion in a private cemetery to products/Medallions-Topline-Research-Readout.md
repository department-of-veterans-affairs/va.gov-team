## Initial Findings

_Add ~5-10 top of mind findings. Include quotes if they are available or particularly noteworthy. [Example top line summary.](https://portigal.com/reading-ahead-topline-summary/)_


**1.	Nearly all participants felt reassured by the help links and additional info components.**

- 7/8 participants utilized additional info components or help links throughout the application.
- Several participants said that they would call the help line with questions about the application process.
- 1 participant explained that they like the link to open in a new tab so that it would not disrupt the current application process.
- 1 participant said that they would use the help to obtain information about the cemetery contact.

> “I like that you have the link where you can learn more about stuff. - Having to learn more about it would be helpful because I don’t have a clue of what it is.” - P13 
“Presidential memorial certificate, I would need to click learn more about it” - P2 
“I like that the learn more opens in a different tab so it doesn’t interrupt the application.” - P3 
As I am going through this and I see continue, my eyes go to need help and I can call the 800 number from M-F from 8am to 730pm if I have questions. Even with it being there I can I know it’s there and I can call with questions.” - P4
“You can get the presidential memorial and the learn more opens in a different tab so that’s nice. I can click on it to learn and I would like it so click yes.” - P4 
“I would click on the certificate link because I don’t know what it is from the title”  - P6 


**2. Nearly all participants opted in to Veteran demographics questions.**

-	7/8 participants opted in to Veteran demographic questions.
-	1 participant opted out of Veteran demographic questions because they said they would not know that information as an organization contact (funeral home.)
-	1 participant said that they would not answer the demographics questions unless they knew for sure, or they would select “prefer not to answer.”
-	1 participant did not like the “prefer not to answer” answer for race, ethnicity, or sex questions.
> “I would voluntarily answer the demographics.” - P4 
“Okay, sure. I guess because on my background I work in the science field so it helps with that statistics. It’s not personal information so it doesn’t feel wrong.” P6 
“If I knew I would answer the demographics but nowadays it can be challenging. I would say no unless I knew for sure.” – P2
“Race and gender is fine I would select yes. That page is fine to me it is just asking race, its fine to me.” – P12
“I don’t have a problem with the demographic question so I would put yes. P7 “


**3. Some participants were hesitant to enter Veteran information if they didn’t know for sure.**
-	 4/8 participants knew where to locate Veteran information.
-	Several participants cited the DD214 as where they would look to find Veteran information.
-	3 participants said that they would intentionally leave fields blank, such as the Veteran’s birth city or social security number, if they weren’t sure.
-	2 participants expressed concern that the funeral home or cemetery might not know the Veteran’s personal details.
> “Birth city lets see if they don’t have that they would leave it blank because I don’t see it as required.” - P3
“Simply because I know at least with my family they are proud of their service branch so I definitely would not want to get it wrong.” – P13
“I wouldn’t fill out the SSN because I don’t know if the funeral director would know that information. … I doubt they would know where they were born though.” - P13
“If I am doing this for a loved one I would know. Um branch of service, as the funeral home person how would I know this information if they are an unknown veteran? If it’s a family member it is easier to know or easier to find out. As a funeral home worker how would I know that?” – P2


**4. Most participants generally understood the burial and claimed remains topics, but had questions about eligibility requirements regarding cremation.**
-	Most participants thought the question “Are the Veteran’s remains buried in their grave?” as clear.
-	3 participants wondered about cremated remains and how that would affect the process.
-	1 participant suggested that “unclaimed” remains meant that the Veteran was also “unknown.”
-	Most participants understood who the ‘next of kin’ would be.
> “Burial location, this is confusing me a little bit. If I am new to this process I would assume they are in a coffin or maybe cremated would be a different option?” - P4 
“Remains claimed, it is making sure whoever the next of kin is has possession of the remains or knows where they are.” - P3 
“Buried in their grave yes unless they are cremated.” – P10
“Next of kin, clicked the drop down. I would click yes. Buried in their grave, Yeah I think it is clear. ” – P13


**5. Some participants experienced confusion around medallion type and sizing.**
-	Most participants understood that the Medal of Honor was not for everyone, and that you would need additional eligibility to receive that medallion. 
-	Most participants think the medallion sizing is a preference. 
-	2 participants wish for a more visual presentation of the medallions on an actual headstone.
-	I participant suggested that the size of the medallion could be based on how long the Veteran had served.
-	2 participants said they would click the link to learn more about medallion types and sizes.
> "I assume bronze is for another and medal of honor is if they received a medal of honor. Bigger medallion is always better.” - P3
“Size of medallion I think that would be a preference.” – P2
“Bronze or Medal of Honor, I don’t know which one there should be an explanation of the difference.” - P2
“The sizes are medium and large. I am still curious of the actual size.” – P4
“Learning about the sizes could be beneficial, I guess maybe learning about how big they would be on the certain headstone and stuff. I was just thinking, the small one looks tiny so I was thinking how it would look in relation to a headstone. The dimensions  are there, but I am visual learner and just reading the numbers don’t mean much to me. I like the picture.” P12
“So the link just says learn more about the sizes so that tells me more about the sizes, not what they each mean. I think the picture helps and there are sizes under the list. It is nice to compare it to a coin for visual reference maybe some people will see the dimensions and be like ‘cool.’” - P6

**6. All participants understood the two-part application process, saying it was quick and straightforward.**
-	Participants understood the two-part application process, and thought it was quick, straight-forward and user friendly.
-	Participants gave the Medallions and Multiple Signatures forms an overall rating of 4.5/5.
-	3 participants referenced other VA.gov and said it fit well with the other forms, and that it was clearer and easier than others they have completed.
> "I liked it and it reminds me of other government forms but clearer than some I have done. So that’s nice.” – P13
“It fits well with the VA forms. Easy to fill and follow. … The second was very polished well but the first one I can fumble through without having been through the process before.” – P4
“I would give it a 5, it was the easiest applications I’ve done on the VA app.” - P10
“It was straightforward. I didn’t see anything that would cause confusion or couldn’t find. I don’t see how anyone would be hindered on the process of applying.” – P3
“Regarding the process itself I would give a 4/4.5 because of how they work together. Excellent process for everyone to be on the same page of things.” – P4

**7. Address validation was familiar and easily understood by most participants.**
-	Address Validation is familiar to most users, but there was some confusion with test data and knowing what the differences were between the suggested and entered addresses. 
-	Participants generally understood what was being asked of them, and how they would proceed through address validation.
-	Participants were careful to double check their address information when prompted with an alert. 
-	Most participants knew to continue if they thought their information was correct.
> "I would need to double check which address is correct, if I typed it correctly I would click the one I typed.” – P2
“This tells me I want to make sure it is correct even though it wasn’t pulled up in the postal information. If it was correct I would use it and if it wasn’t I would edit it then come back here.”-  P4
“I would check to make sure I didn’t type anything wrong. I would still just use this address.” - P7
“The address entered against the suggested address is good because you can pick the correct one. That’s a good placement. I would like the suggested address to be a different color so I knew they were separate; it would show that they are different.” – P7
