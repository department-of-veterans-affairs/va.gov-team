# Conversation Guide – Apply for a medallion in a private cemetery
## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] 
is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would 
like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...
Today we're going to talk about the process of applying for a Medallion for a
deceased Veteran to be placed in a private cemetery. A bit of background, in
this process the applicant will fill out a form for the medallion and submit. 
Then a second form, which is a shortened version of the first form, is sent to
the cemetery to review and sign. If approved, the medallion will be sent.
Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not
to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next 
question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no 
right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I 
welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any 
opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not 
have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate 
or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like 
to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at 
any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it 
was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-
check with you before we get going.
- **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
No observers in the waiting room.
- **Are you on a desktop, mobile or tablet device?** Laptop.
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we
talk today? Yes that is okay.
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay 
with me recording this session once more.**
*Start recording.*
- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I 
record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes it is okay to record 
the screen and audio.
## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
1. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?  I served in the Army form 
97 to 06, was in Iraq from 04 to 06. Got out, started a family, 10 years in 
agriculture. Medically required in 2018 and not I volunteer for Veteran 
outreach and Suicide prevention
2. Did you know that you could apply for a medallion for a deceased 
Veteran to be placed on their headstone or marker at any time?  Yes
- If yes, how did you find out? I am a  VSO dealing with the VFW when 
they do funerals. The family members apply through the VSO.
3. Would this be something you’d be interested in applying for?  Yes
## Getting Started - 1 minute
- I'm going to give you a scenario for you to walk through of a prototype of 
this application and please give us your thoughts.
- The prototype link I shared is a work in progress, so there might be a few 
mistakes, or it may not function exactly the way you expect, which is ok. 
Some areas will be clickable and some will not and some fields will fill in 
when you click on them. Some of the questions you may not know the 
answer to, and that's ok.
- While you're going through the scenario, it would be really helpful if you'd 
think aloud - kind of like you'd do if you were talking to yourself. We are 
interested in your first reactions, what you're thinking & wondering as you 
go through the process. The more you say about what you are thinking and 
wondering, the more we’ll learn, so we want to hear your honest opinions. 
We're not testing your ability. We just want to improve the form to better 
meet Veteran's needs. We won't be offended by any opinions you express, 
and we welcome your feedback.
- When you think aloud, it helps us understand what works well and where 
we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you 
have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free 
to ask them along the way.
## First Task: [Funeral home applicant]
- **Step 1:** You are Alex Wilson, a funeral home employee working for 
Wilson & Wilson. You want a medallion sent to you to place on a deceased 
Veteran’s headstone. You will complete the application from start to finish 
for the medallion.
- **Step 2:** You are a cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an 
application.
## Second Task: [Family member applicant]
- **Step 1:** You are Alex Wilson, a family member of the deceased Veteran. 
You want to send the medallion to your brother to place on the Veteran’s 
headstone. You will complete the application from start to finish.
I see the hyper link to start but I read the steps to do it first. It takes 
about 15 minutes, you need the SSN, place of birth/death. I am writing it 
down on paper so I don’t forget. I would start. Of course you have the 
number to call if you have any questions. Okay its prefilled. Relationship is 
family member, yes. My contact information, okay. My mailing address. 
Checking mailing address. Let me go back, (Reading page) As long as they 
don’t ask for the extra 4 digits for the postal code, you always have to go 
search for that. Okay it is probably the street instead of ST. I would think 
that’s what the post office doesn’t agree with. You still have to click 
forward. I don’t see any red flags. It is user friendly. Okay veteran 
information. Middle initial would really help. Okay the DD214. City and 
state yes because that would match the DD214. I think mine matches NC. If 
it is asking I would try to provide it. Good questions, sure. Okay. Sometimes 
the service number is before they did the SSN. Um this is what it reminds 
me of, in Vietnam they used their SSN. You can add 2 service periods, okay. 
That would for people that got out then came back in or got called back 
after discharge. Next of kin, it would be a spouse, sibling if parents are 
deceased or oldest child. Yes I would think it is clear. Then you have how we
define the next of kin. Buried in their grave yes unless they are cremated. 
(Reading page) If I remember correct you click the hyperlink and it shows 
pictures. Yes I would click it because two slides back it has what is next of 
kin so I would open this too for visual instead of wording. This is saying that
they are already incased. Cemetery information and then the ground keeper
will get something then other requirements. Okay. I would say caretaker 
information for the cemetery. Cemetery address. Okay. Okay looking at the 
discrepancies. Okay so I would go back to see what was typed in. 151. Yes I 
would check. Alright. Type of request, new medallion or replacement. A 
replacement means it ahs been damaged, new is the first one there so we 
want a new one since he just passed. The hyperlink lets you look at the 
different one. If he didn’t get a Medal of Honor he could get the bronze 
medallion. Depending on the headstone size, they are all free so. 
Presidential certificate is pretty neat. I have my grandfathers and my great 
grandfathers. You can get as many as you want. It is asking for proof of 
information and military service. You can scan it to submit. Separation, 
discharge or pre-eligibility. I was seeing why it kicked back because its 
there. Do you want me to click on it to see the document. Review 
application so go through all of the steps. Theres a open button here to 
open everything to check. Stolen valor or identity.. Statement of truth, 
accept. I would click print this page. You should get an email confirmation. 
More than likely the caretaker should get ahold of you depending on when 
you had it mailed. It could go to the cemetery or to you yourself.
- **Step 2:** You are a cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an 
application.
Okay. I wonder why the plot information wasn’t there. I remember 
having to have the information before, maybe times have changed and the 
caretaker already knows. More information always helps those in charge. I 
just don’t like it being kicked back if I could have provided that information.
Okay, its shipped there. Again you can open these individuals.
- **Second form:** You completed the form and did great. The first task is 
done, so erase all that out of your mind. We are going to now start the 
second scenario we want to have you test. **Select button**. You are a 
cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an application. Again, you are
a cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an application.
- **Intro secondary form:** How does the participant feel about having to 
create an account?
## Post-Task Interview
You’ve completed the task. Now we’re going to ask you some post task 
interview questions.
- **Question 1:** What did you think of the application process overall for 
both forms? It was smooth and concise. Follow the instructions and it walks 
you through it.
- **Question 2:** On a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being the lowest and 5 being 
the highest, how would you rate the application process for Medallions you 
just experienced? It was user friendly so I would go 4. I mean we do these 
to make it a five so I will leave it at that. Theres good training so we will let 
the training score it as a 4.
- **Question 3:** If you could snap your fingers and recreate the application 
process for Medallions to make it better or do things differently, what would
that process look like? I think it was pretty solid as it was. I know its on 
va.gov site and they are plain and concise as it is. There were the hyperlinks
for visual appearances. Some people don’t think they can do it their self so 
that’s why they go to the VSO. It is user friendly; you just have to want to do
it. Yeah. They are intimated because it’s a government entity but as a 
veteran I want to do what I can to help.
- **Question 4:** Is there anything else on your mind that we didn't ask?  No
because it was concise. Anything outside of that isn’t needed. No everything
was needed in this form.
• I'm going to ask my colleague [Charlie or Carly] if they have questions
currently and also check the channel to see if any of our observers have any
questions. [Check Teams chat for questions]
• Do you have any questions for me?
Anything we could do that would bring the 4 to a 5: No the form itself was 
awesome I enjoyed it. Maybe have the hyperlinks available to see the 
pictures for whoever is doing it may not know the other options of medallion
or the placement on the headstone itself.
## Thank-You and Closing
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us
today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site 
and make sure it really works for Veterans.
Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little 
blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide 
them the chance to participate in future research studies.
Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!
