# Conversation Guide – Apply for a medallion in a private cemetery
## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] 
is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would 
like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...
Today we're going to talk about the process of applying for a Medallion for a
deceased Veteran to be placed in a private cemetery. A bit of background, in
this process the applicant will fill out a form for the medallion and submit. 
Then a second form, which is a shortened version of the first form, is sent to
the cemetery to review and sign. If approved, the medallion will be sent.
Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not
to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next 
question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no 
right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I 
welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any 
opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not 
have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate 
or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like 
to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at 
any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it 
was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-
check with you before we get going.
- **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
Yes
- **Are you on a desktop, mobile or tablet device?**  Mobile.
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we
talk today? Sure no problem. Yes
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay 
with me recording this session once more.**
*Start recording.*
- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I 
record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes confirmed.
## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
1. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? My name is William and 
located in GA. I have a 17-year history of an information security system for 
the ranger battalion. I am getting into AI compliance and have a good eye 
for patterning information. I am happy to participate in any research 
opportunity.
2. Did you know that you could apply for a medallion for a deceased 
Veteran to be placed on their headstone or marker at any time? I did not
3. Would this be something you’d be interested in applying for? I would 
be interested in learning more and see what it is.
## Getting Started - 1 minute
- I'm going to give you a scenario for you to walk through of a prototype of 
this application and please give us your thoughts.
- The prototype link I shared is a work in progress, so there might be a few 
mistakes, or it may not function exactly the way you expect, which is ok. 
Some areas will be clickable and some will not and some fields will fill in 
when you click on them. Some of the questions you may not know the 
answer to, and that's ok.
- While you're going through the scenario, it would be really helpful if you'd 
think aloud - kind of like you'd do if you were talking to yourself. We are 
interested in your first reactions, what you're thinking & wondering as you 
go through the process. The more you say about what you are thinking and 
wondering, the more we’ll learn, so we want to hear your honest opinions. 
We're not testing your ability. We just want to improve the form to better 
meet Veteran's needs. We won't be offended by any opinions you express, 
and we welcome your feedback.
- When you think aloud, it helps us understand what works well and where 
we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you 
have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free 
to ask them along the way.
## First Task: [Funeral home applicant]
- **Step 1:** You are Alex Wilson, a funeral home employee working for 
Wilson & Wilson. You want a medallion sent to you to place on a deceased 
Veteran’s headstone. You will complete the application from start to finish 
for the medallion.
As I am scrolling I think why medallion is lowercase. It through me 
off. It says it should take 15 minutes, which I know so that is good. I feel 
secure in starting the application. It is pulling information from my profile 
so that’s good and I can save the application to finish later which is good. I 
am the funeral home representative. Organization, okay. Just something 
here throws me off. The organization contact information through me off. 
It’s just at the top it says 1 of 7 application information. The organization 
contact information. We will contact the organization you place here, then 
ahs more writing. That’s a lot instead of just going to the email and number.
Alright it tells me to check the address to confirm it. If it is correct you can 
continue. This tells me I want to make sure it is correct even though it 
wasn’t pulled up in the postal information. If it was correct I would use it 
and if it wasn’t I would edit it then come back here. Again here the veteran 
personal information the SSN looks a little off. The header should be bigger 
than veteran’s social security number. Okay, right here the DOB is required 
and DOD is required. The birth city and state I don’t have the options so I 
assume its part of the prototype. Optional for race and gender, I would say 
yes. Alright. I would pick not Hispanic. I would put black/African American 
then continue. I would click male and continue. I would voluntarily answer 
the demographics. Service number I would enter, it is not required so 
actually I would not enter it. Looks good. I have an option to edit or delete 
the enter/exit date and I can enter the additional service periods. It says it 
will save the application each time. It sells be burial but then it says it will 
save the application on each change, it shouldn’t be there. Nex of kin 
definition is good to have that as a quick reference. I feel like that question 
is very clear. I haven’t been through the process but I would understand 
what that meant. Burial location, this is confusing me a little bit. If I am new
to this process I would assume they are in a coffin or maybe cremated 
would be a different option. Yes for coffin and no for cremation would be 
what I get form the question. Headstone or marker, I feel like headstone or 
marker is larger so I know what section I am in. Now I am trying to 
understand. The medallion is a marker that has to be attached to something
and fi they don’t have one they may not be able to get one. that’s easy to 
understand. If they don’t have one they can learn more to possibly get one. 
that is good to have there.  Pretty clear and self-explanatory. Um, I think the
wording for who they should contact at the cemetery should be changed it 
is throwing me off. I like that if they don’t have the correct email the 
application cannot be processed. That is clear to the point. Cemetery 
address is filled in, okay. As I am going through this and I see continue my 
eyes go to need help and I can call the 800 number from M-F from 8am to 
730pm if I have questions. Even with it being there I can I know it’s there 
and I can call with questions. That is standard people would see the address
correction at some point. The address entered against the suggested 
address is good because you can pick the correct one. That’s a good 
placement. I would like the suggested address to be a different color so I 
knew they were separate; it would show that they are different. We’re doing
a new medallion and you can get a bronze or medal of honor. I would click 
medal of honor and you can learn more about the medallions, it opens a new
tab so I don’t lose what I have done. I can explore then come back to where 
I am. You can get it in two sizes and it shows you the sizes, dimensions 
would be nice to show inches. The sizes are medium and large. I am still 
curious of the actual size. You can get the presidential memorial and the 
learn more opens in a different tab so that’s nice. That was self-explanatory. 
I can click on it to learn and I would like it so click yes. How many would 
you like; I am now curious as to why I would need more than one. I may 
need a breadcrumb save me links so I can go see exactly what it is and why 
I may need more than 1. Ill request 2. Veteran separation paper DD214, 
preneed or eligible, other service documentation. DD214 I understand, 
discharge I can understand but it is technically the dd214. Preneed or 
eligible letter I would want to click that button and I am glad it’s there so I 
can see the information needed. I can see that if they don’t have any of 
these still apply and we can try to get them for you. I would want that in 
italics because it is very important. I like the upload option and they have 
mail and fax options as well. Review the application is self-explanatory. 
Everything will expand. Theres a nice legal precedence there and the 
statement of truth. It is clear but not 100 percent clear in the statement of 
truth. Um I think there may be a way to condense it and at no expense to 
the government would be in the privacy policy. It would make me wonder 
what is not at expense of the government. I think the wording is off. Maybe 
if it says it will be attached to the headstone as outlined in in accordance 
with. I think I may be making it more complicated but less complicated in 
the end. You get the good green and checkmark letting us know it was 
submitted. I would like a download but there is a print option. I think this 
flows well and I like how it looks. It ahs what to expect next. I think this 
page looks excellent.
- **Step 2:** You are a cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an 
application.
Okay. Go to sign in and going to the top of the page is always helpful. 
Oaky all of that information. It matches what we did previously so I can see 
how this process works. Deceased veteran, okay we got that information 
form what they completed on the application side. (Reading page) Cemtery 
name is self-explanatory and easy to read. Looks good. Medallion details, we
have the specs there nice. Good to have learn more about. Looks great. I 
don’t like the wording for they will ship it to this person but I know we cant 
put the name. I would think that the VA will ship a medallion to this 
recipient or another word for authorized personnel or something on that 
line of words. This one is really easy, it pulled everything and makes it easy 
for them to review. Now we can go through and review these areas to make 
sure it is correct. Interestingly I see it on this one sign the statement of 
truth. This is the same type of statement as before that would be dated and 
signed. Then submit application.
## Second Task: [Family member applicant]
- **Step 1:** You are Alex Wilson, a family member of the deceased Veteran. 
You want to send the medallion to your brother to place on the Veteran’s 
headstone. You will complete the application from start to finish.
- **Step 2:** You are a cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an 
application.
- **Second form:** You completed the form and did great. The first task is 
done, so erase all that out of your mind. We are going to now start the 
second scenario we want to have you test. **Select button**. You are a 
cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an application. Again, you are
a cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an application.
- **Intro secondary form:** How does the participant feel about having to 
create an account?
## Post-Task Interview
You’ve completed the task. Now we’re going to ask you some post task 
interview questions.
- **Question 1:** What did you think of the application process overall for 
both forms?  The second form did a good job of prefiling it and making it so 
no mistakes could be made. The first one was good but some wordings and 
header sizes like bold here and there to impact certain lines. It fits will with 
the va forms. Easy to fill and follow. You can open a tab without closing the 
window and it flowed smoothly. The second was very polished well but the 
first one I can fumble through without having been through the process 
before. Also you can dial the 1800 number if you need help. Overall both 
were great.
- **Question 2:** On a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being the lowest and 5 being 
the highest, how would you rate the application process for Medallions you 
just experienced? Regarding the process itself I would give a 4/4.5 because 
of how they work together. Excellent process for everyone to be on the same
page of things. I look at it like block chains in contract word. I see it as 
working together and it is simple and pretty easy.
- **Question 3:** If you could snap your fingers and recreate the application 
process for Medallions to make it better or do things differently, what would
that process look like?  I would give Mad3ellion ad capital M. I would add a 
few differentials and italic/bolds for areas so they don’t look exactly the 
same and you can see that there is a difference.
- **Question 4:** Is there anything else on your mind that we didn't ask?  
Maybe an areas if you are experiencing grief to have a link or reference to 
help. It would be helpful to add some mental health links there.
• I'm going to ask my colleague [Charlie or Carly] if they have questions
currently and also check the channel to see if any of our observers have any
questions. [Check Teams chat for questions]
• Do you have any questions for me?
