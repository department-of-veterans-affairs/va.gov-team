# Conversation Guide – Apply for a medallion in a private cemetery
## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] 
is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would 
like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...
Today we're going to talk about the process of applying for a Medallion for a
deceased Veteran to be placed in a private cemetery. A bit of background, in
this process the applicant will fill out a form for the medallion and submit. 
Then a second form, which is a shortened version of the first form, is sent to
the cemetery to review and sign. If approved, the medallion will be sent.
Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not
to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next 
question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no 
right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I 
welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any 
opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not 
have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate 
or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like 
to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at 
any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it 
was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-
check with you before we get going.
- **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
No observers in the waiting room.
- **Are you on a desktop, mobile or tablet device?** Laptop
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we
talk today?  Of course
*Start recording.*
- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I 
record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes.
## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
1. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? I am military family; I have 
five uncles that served in the military. I was enlisted and an officer for 13 
years. My spouse is prior military. It has been a large part of our life. My 
background is intelligence and field artillery. 3 deployments and injured. 
Disabled vet. I currently work for TX and IL to help individuals with 
disability to get services for independent living. I have twins that are 5 and I
am 39 years old.
2. Did you know that you could apply for a medallion for a deceased 
Veteran to be placed on their headstone or marker at any time?  No I didn’t.
3. Would this be something you’d be interested in applying for? Yes
## Getting Started - 1 minute
- I'm going to give you a scenario for you to walk through of a prototype of 
this application and please give us your thoughts.
- The prototype link I shared is a work in progress, so there might be a few 
mistakes, or it may not function exactly the way you expect, which is ok. 
Some areas will be clickable and some will not and some fields will fill in 
when you click on them. Some of the questions you may not know the 
answer to, and that's ok.
- While you're going through the scenario, it would be really helpful if you'd 
think aloud - kind of like you'd do if you were talking to yourself. We are 
interested in your first reactions, what you're thinking & wondering as you 
go through the process. The more you say about what you are thinking and 
wondering, the more we’ll learn, so we want to hear your honest opinions. 
We're not testing your ability. We just want to improve the form to better 
meet Veteran's needs. We won't be offended by any opinions you express, 
and we welcome your feedback.
- When you think aloud, it helps us understand what works well and where 
we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you 
have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free 
to ask them along the way.
## First Task: [Funeral home applicant]
- **Step 1:** You are Alex Wilson, a funeral home employee working for 
Wilson & Wilson. You want a medallion sent to you to place on a deceased 
Veteran’s headstone. You will complete the application from start to finish 
for the medallion.
 
- **Step 2:** You are a cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an 
application.
 
## Second Task: [Family member applicant]
- **Step 1:** You are Alex Wilson, a family member of the deceased Veteran. 
You want to send the medallion to your brother to place on the Veteran’s 
headstone. You will complete the application from start to finish.
Okay. First thing on most va things when you login and it has multiple fact 
so it prefills things and I appreciate that so it makes admin things easy. I see
the start link but I read everything to have everything I need instead of 
stopping midway through. I see how long it will take to see if I can do it in 
one sitting or have to do it multiple times. It has the preloaded information. 
I am the family member. The family member and personal representative, 
you could put unrelated representative just because I thought maybe they 
could be the same thing for a second. It was confusing at first reading them 
both. For other you can put individuals that served with the individuals. 
Email, and it prefills. That is straightforward. Mailing address it will prefill 
all rightly. Confirm address. I guess this is because of new builds and 
address this happens, this happens with my current address now. If there 
were something to address it on the mailing address when it verifies it . 
does it have it to see what the record they have on file? I would say use this 
address. Birth city lets see if they don’t have that they would leave it blank 
because I don’t see it as required. Demographics I would assume they don’t 
need additional information other than SSN/DOB/DOD and name to verify 
their service. (reading page) This is what I was expecting, this is where I 
expected SSN /DOD/DOB here near the service information. On here I have 
two separate start dates and end dates because I enlisted then did green to 
gold and then finished my second . It would be good to have a button to add 
the second service dates. Oh here it is. Remains claimed, it is making sure 
whoever the next of kin is has passion of the remains or knows where they 
are. Okay I like that the learn more opens in a different tab so it doesn’t 
interrupt the application. Cemetery information may be hard for some 
placed. Oh I like the know what to do if there isn’t contact information for 
the cemetery. The mailing address here is what I was talking about 
confirming the address. I guess it just didn’t find it earlier. It doesn’t say 
anything about replacement medallions at the beginning, it should be added
on the front end so they know they can order replacements. Learning about 
the medallions and what you qualify for. I assume bronze is for another and 
medal of honor is if they received a medal of honor. Bigger medallion is 
always better. Wow that’s cool you can request more than on presidential 
certificate. A lot of families will appreciate that. (Reading page) Okay I 
assume it wants me to click that. You can mail or fax as well. Here we are 
reviewing it all to make sure everything is there. Yupp. Okay.
- **Step 2:** You are a cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an 
application.
- **Second form:** You completed the form and did great. The first task is 
done, so erase all that out of your mind. We are going to now start the 
second scenario we want to have you test. **Select button**. You are a 
cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an application. Again, you are
a cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an application.
Go through this again, okay. This is the deceased veteran. Cemetery details, 
Yupp. Medallion details, I know I picked large, it is showing medium. Should
I know the difference? I just want to make sure it wasn’t me and there 
wasn’t a bug in the system. Okay went through all of that. This is the family 
member reviewing the information entered. With that, other than sending 
an email, how do they contact them because I know my va emails go to the 
junk folder or the promotions folder and they get filtered. I don’t see them 
unless I look for them.
- **Intro secondary form:** How does the participant feel about having to 
create an account?
## Post-Task Interview
You’ve completed the task. Now we’re going to ask you some post task 
interview questions.
- **Question 1:** What did you think of the application process overall for 
both forms? Most va forms are intense and you have to verify things. Having
it tied to the account is helpful because having years go by and not having 
exact dates. That time can blend together especially for those withy 
TBI/PTSD or lived a long life. Any way to help whoever it is to pull the 
information without having all of the data is helpful. It was straightforward. 
I didn’t see anything that would cause confusion or couldn’t find. I don’t see
how anyone would be hindered on the process of applying.
- **Question 2:** On a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being the lowest and 5 being 
the highest, how would you rate the application process for Medallions you 
just experienced? I would give it a 5, it was the easiest applications I’ve 
done on the va app
- **Question 3:** If you could snap your fingers and recreate the application 
process for Medallions to make it better or do things differently, what would
that process look like?  What I have done on my own you have the previous 
and next, we have the task bar with buttons for next steps so they can click 
in between them. If you allow someone to go back and forward to click up 
top if they are trying to get information form a prior tab. That would help 
them navigate/
- **Question 4:** Is there anything else on your mind that we didn't ask?  I 
didn’t see it on there. I know the medallions were set on stone. It didn’t ask 
for unit notification. I know some go to ceremonies for these items and they 
have information with a drop down for the o club or 2nd ID cemetery group 
to have representatives for the presentation. That would also add to the 
benefit for doing this for that individual.
• I'm going to ask my colleague [Charlie or Carly] if they have questions
currently and also check the channel to see if any of our observers have any
questions. [Check Teams chat for questions]
• Do you have any questions for me?
## Thank-You and Closing
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us
today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site 
and make sure it really works for Veterans.
Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little 
blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide 
them the chance to participate in future research studies.
Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!
