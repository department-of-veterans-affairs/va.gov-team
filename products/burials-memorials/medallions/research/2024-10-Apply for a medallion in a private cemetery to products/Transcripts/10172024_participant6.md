# Conversation Guide – Apply for a medallion in a private cemetery
## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] 
is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would 
like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...
Today we're going to talk about the process of applying for a Medallion for a
deceased Veteran to be placed in a private cemetery. A bit of background, in
this process the applicant will fill out a form for the medallion and submit. 
Then a second form, which is a shortened version of the first form, is sent to
the cemetery to review and sign. If approved, the medallion will be sent.
Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not
to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next 
question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no 
right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I 
welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any 
opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not 
have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate 
or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like 
to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at 
any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it 
was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-
check with you before we get going.
- **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
- **Are you on a desktop, mobile or tablet device?** Laptop
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we
talk today? Yes
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay 
with me recording this session once more.**
*Start recording.*
- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I 
record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes
## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
1. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? Um I guess where do I 
start. My dad is retired, brother is still serving and so am I. My dad was 
Army and Air Force and my brother/I are Army.
2. Did you know that you could apply for a medallion for a deceased 
Veteran to be placed on their headstone or marker at any time?  I did not.
3. Would this be something you’d be interested in applying for? 
Potentially once I find out more about what it is.
## Getting Started - 1 minute
- I'm going to give you a scenario for you to walk through of a prototype of 
this application and please give us your thoughts.
- The prototype link I shared is a work in progress, so there might be a few 
mistakes, or it may not function exactly the way you expect, which is ok. 
Some areas will be clickable and some will not and some fields will fill in 
when you click on them. Some of the questions you may not know the 
answer to, and that's ok.
- While you're going through the scenario, it would be really helpful if you'd 
think aloud - kind of like you'd do if you were talking to yourself. We are 
interested in your first reactions, what you're thinking & wondering as you 
go through the process. The more you say about what you are thinking and 
wondering, the more we’ll learn, so we want to hear your honest opinions. 
We're not testing your ability. We just want to improve the form to better 
meet Veteran's needs. We won't be offended by any opinions you express, 
and we welcome your feedback.
- When you think aloud, it helps us understand what works well and where 
we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you 
have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free 
to ask them along the way.
## First Task: [Funeral home applicant]
- **Step 1:** You are Alex Wilson, a funeral home employee working for 
Wilson & Wilson. You want a medallion sent to you to place on a deceased 
Veteran’s headstone. You will complete the application from start to finish 
for the medallion.
- **Step 2:** You are a cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an 
application.
## Second Task: [Family member applicant]
- **Step 1:** You are Alex Wilson, a family member of the deceased Veteran. 
You want to send the medallion to your brother to place on the Veteran’s 
headstone. You will complete the application from start to finish.
Initially I think it is meant to be looked at on a phone. Its narrow so it 
gives phone vibes. I like that it is numbered it seems straightforward. Okay. 
It looks like I need to start at step 1. I would start here so I would go 
through the steps, I assume they are eligible, then I would gather their 
information I assume I have that then I would start the application. Is there 
a button for that. Oh its right here so I would click it. Okay type in my name.
I like I can save and come back later. Family member so click that. SO far 
this is really easy and straight forward. Contact info, cool that makes sense. 
Mailing address okay cool. Check the address, Okay I would assume it is 
correct. Can it tell me why. Okay. I assume it is correct. This is the 
deceased.  Is there a certain timeframe that it needs to be completed in. 
Okay we have all of the information already. That part is optional. Okay, 
sure. I guess because on my background I work in the science field so it 
helps with that statistics. It’s not personal information so it doesn’t feel 
wrong. Okay, cool. Kion claimed: how I think it is that it is at the funeral 
home or however they are planning on processing the body. Whatever the 
next step is for the family. This answers my question about when to do this 
process because it could be either. Okay, lets say yes. Okay. That makes 
sense. Cemetery contact, okay. Make sense. Confirm the address, ooo I 
guess I would go with the suggested. Its possible they missed a few 
numbers. That’s nice to know that you can replace it. Bronze or Medal of 
Honor I would assume Bronze is the default one. You can get it in three 
sizes, I don’t know if the size matters. I guess ill go with medium. Um so the
link just says learn more about the sizes so that tells me more about the 
sizes not what they each mean. I think the picture helps and there are sizes 
under the list. It is nice to compare it to a coin for visual reference maybe 
some people will see the dimensions and be like cool. Maybe how it would 
look on a gravestone for a reference. I would click on the certificate link 
because I don’t know what it is from the title. Then sure I will say I want 
one. Hoe many, you can get more than one what. I guess I’ll request 2 I am 
not sure what it is still so I don’t know if it is significant. Supporting 
documents, okay. I don’t know if the links have what the blank form, people 
that were not in the military will not know what they look like. If you don’t 
have them apply anyways. You can upload them, mail, alright. Personal 
representative to me is unclear, I don’t know if its difference from a family 
member. Um to me I am not sure what it means. POA is when you have 
access to certain things. I would assume it’s a family member or spouse. I 
would assume I fall into that category. You can print it but I assume they 
send you confirmation. Okay.
- **Step 2:** You are a cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an 
application.
I assume I have an account, okay cool. Veteran information, it sounds 
misleading because it says application because you are reviewing. It’s like I 
am the one applying. Okay cool. Cemetery and this is the contact 
information okay. Medallion, okay. Shipping it to this person. I guess the 
only thing that is unclear is how it is affixing it to the gravestone. Do you 
bring it and just stick it on there, I am not sure.
- **Second form:** You completed the form and did great. The first task is 
done, so erase all that out of your mind. We are going to now start the 
second scenario we want to have you test. **Select button**. You are a 
cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an application. Again, you are
a cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an application.
- **Intro secondary form:** How does the participant feel about having to 
create an account?
## Post-Task Interview
You’ve completed the task. Now we’re going to ask you some post task 
interview questions.
- **Question 1:** What did you think of the application process overall for 
both forms?  It felt very straightforward. There were a couple of things that 
I thought were a little unclear but it also just could have been because the 
links, the other links weren't clickable. But I thought the information asked 
for was very straightforward, and it didn't seem overly complicated, which 
was nice. Definitely doesn't take very long. I guess if you have to upload 
stuff I could see how it would take 15 minutes, but I think it could also take 
less than that. yeah, I didn't think it was difficult, and that was nice
- **Question 2:** On a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being the lowest and 5 being 
the highest, how would you rate the application process for Medallions you 
just experienced? I guess I would do a 4.5 because  thought it was simple 
but there were a few things unclear but it could be because I am younger. 
Theres the help feature but that’s nice. I don’t know if you’d be on hold for 
30 minutes.
- **Question 3:** If you could snap your fingers and recreate the application 
process for Medallions to make it better or do things differently, what would
that process look like?  I might, maybe, have all the documents that you can
bring in person. I know that is helpful for older people tog et it answered in 
person. I thought it was really good as it was.
- **Question 4:** Is there anything else on your mind that we didn't ask? It 
might be hel0ful it include a blurb about what a medallion is and why it 
could be helpful. For me it just indicates that you are a veteran and just 
another thing to do. Maybe have what the presidential certificate is and why
you might want that.
• I'm going to ask my colleague [Charlie or Carly] if they have questions
currently and also check the channel to see if any of our observers have any
questions. [Check Teams chat for questions]
• Do you have any questions for me?
## Thank-You and Closing
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us
today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little 
blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide 
them the chance to participate in future research studies.
Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!
