# Conversation Guide – Apply for a medallion in a private cemetery
## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] 
is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would 
like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...
Today we're going to talk about the process of applying for a Medallion for a
deceased Veteran to be placed in a private cemetery. A bit of background, in
this process the applicant will fill out a form for the medallion and submit. 
Then a second form, which is a shortened version of the first form, is sent to
the cemetery to review and sign. If approved, the medallion will be sent.
Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not
to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next 
question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no 
right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I 
welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any 
opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not 
have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate 
or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like 
to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at 
any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it 
was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-
check with you before we get going.
- **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
Yes
- **Are you on a desktop, mobile or tablet device?**  I am on a laptop
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we
talk today? Yes
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay 
with me recording this session once more.**
*Start recording.*
- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I 
record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes.
## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
1. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?  Okay. Yes my name is 
Rosland. I was in the Army, currently graduated college and looking at a 
project management degree. Have 4 childr4en and a die-hard chiefs fan
2. Did you know that you could apply for a medallion for a deceased 
Veteran to be placed on their headstone or marker at any time?  No I didn’t.
3. Would this be something you’d be interested in applying for? Could I 
do it for myself or someone that is already deceased. Someone would apply 
for me postmortem.
## Getting Started - 1 minute
- I'm going to give you a scenario for you to walk through of a prototype of 
this application and please give us your thoughts.
- The prototype link I shared is a work in progress, so there might be a few 
mistakes, or it may not function exactly the way you expect, which is ok. 
Some areas will be clickable and some will not and some fields will fill in 
when you click on them. Some of the questions you may not know the 
answer to, and that's ok.
- While you're going through the scenario, it would be really helpful if you'd 
think aloud - kind of like you'd do if you were talking to yourself. We are 
interested in your first reactions, what you're thinking & wondering as you 
go through the process. The more you say about what you are thinking and 
wondering, the more we’ll learn, so we want to hear your honest opinions. 
We're not testing your ability. We just want to improve the form to better 
meet Veteran's needs. We won't be offended by any opinions you express, 
and we welcome your feedback.
- When you think aloud, it helps us understand what works well and where 
we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you 
have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free 
to ask them along the way.
## First Task: [Funeral home applicant]
- **Step 1:** You are Alex Wilson, a funeral home employee working for 
Wilson & Wilson. You want a medallion sent to you to place on a deceased 
Veteran’s headstone. You will complete the application from start to finish 
for the medallion.
Okay. Relationship to the veteran, so me as Alex I am applying for it 
talking to the funeral home. So that would be other since it is me. Okay so I 
am a representative of a funeral home. I was about to type, I am sorry. Okay.
Okay. Confirm the address. Cant confirm the address but with me knowing 
it is the address the first thing that comes to my mind is that they will add 
the extra 4 digits to the zip code but I would check to make sure I didn’t 
type anything wrong. I would still just use this address. Did you want me to 
pick a suffix. Okay birth city. Okay. I don’t have a problem with the 
demographic question so I would put yes. Okay. On this one when it says 
prefer not to answer, I would rather answer incase they are doing a survey 
to check to see if they need to reach out to more people or to know who is 
completing this. No the way the questions are written is okay. I am okay 
with that question. You know what I saw that up there so I was thinking that
it would already be there since it was highlights. Would the service number 
be the SSN. Yes I would get the service information from the dd12. On this 
one when it says have the next of kin claimed the responsibility of their 
remains I would have thought that they already have that responsibility if 
they’re already buried. I would have thought they already paid for the 
burial. I am okay with that question. I would think what remains wouldn’t 
be buried. Okay moving to the next question. Okay. I would say yes, okay. I 
am okay with that question. I am okay with that. On this one I am checking 
to see the difference for the address but if this comes up I usually, oh I see 
it’s a typo. Okay lets use the suggested because tis a typo on my end. This is
a new medallion. On this question whether a bronze or medal of honor if I 
didn’t know which one would I choose. Both of them have different 
meanings correct. Ill say Medal of Honor. Okay. This one I would pick large 
so it can be seen. Okay so I would want the certificate as a keepsake. Okay I
am good with this question because if I didn’t have the forms they would try
to get it for me. I am fine with that.  I would click on them to make sure I 
typed everything correctly. Okay. Then I would print this page and save it as
a PDF so I have it on my computer. I like that I can mail or fax the 
supporting documents.
- **Step 2:** You are a cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an 
application.
Okay. I am just reading all of the information. Okay. Just reviewing 
who it is for. I like how it gave the size so I know the right size was 
submitted. Okay so they will ship it to me. Okay. I would review again to 
make sure everything was correct from what was sent to me. So yes. Then 
submit the application.
## Second Task: [Family member applicant]
- **Step 1:** You are Alex Wilson, a family member of the deceased Veteran. 
You want to send the medallion to your brother to place on the Veteran’s 
headstone. You will complete the application from start to finish.
- **Step 2:** You are a cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an 
application.
- **Second form:** You completed the form and did great. The first task is 
done, so erase all that out of your mind. We are going to now start the 
second scenario we want to have you test. **Select button**. You are a 
cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an application. Again, you are
a cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an application.
- **Intro secondary form:** How does the participant feel about having to 
create an account?
## Post-Task Interview
You’ve completed the task. Now we’re going to ask you some post task 
interview questions.
- **Question 1:** What did you think of the application process overall for 
both forms? I thought it was simple. The only thing I didn’t like on the first 
form was the demographics of asking. I guess I wouldn’t want the not to 
prefer but I know some don’t want to answer it. Other than that it was nice 
and simple. Nothing to difficult for me to complete.
- **Question 2:** On a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being the lowest and 5 being 
the highest, how would you rate the application process for Medallions you 
just experienced? 5.
- **Question 3:** If you could snap your fingers and recreate the application 
process for Medallions to make it better or do things differently, what would
that process look like? I would keep it the same because you are getting all 
of the information and if I can’t get the paper would you’d assist so I would 
keep it the same.
- **Question 4:** Is there anything else on your mind that we didn't ask?  No
• I'm going to ask my colleague [Charlie or Carly] if they have questions
currently and also check the channel to see if any of our observers have any
questions. [Check Teams chat for questions]
• Do you have any questions for me?
## Thank-You and Closing
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us
today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little 
blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide 
them the chance to participate in future research studies.
Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!
