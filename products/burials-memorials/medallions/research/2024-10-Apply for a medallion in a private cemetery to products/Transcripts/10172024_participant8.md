## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 
Today we're going to talk about the process of applying for a Medallion for a deceased Veteran to be placed in a private cemetery. A bit of background, in this process the applicant will fill out a form for the medallion and submit. Then a second form, which is a shortened version of the first form, is sent to the cemetery to review and sign. If approved, the medallion will be sent.
Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going.
- **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers and **have everyone turn on cameras**
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you on a desktop, mobile or tablet device?**
- **I'm going to send you a link in the chat that I would like for you to open.** [Link](https://www.figma.com/proto/QIMsAdHJjctTKDM1I34uXV/Medallions---Baseline-Prototype?page-id=2%3A2&node-id=2185-38626&node-type=frame&viewport=12548%2C5040%2C0.3&t=ql7d2qYUg3eKaxGb-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=2185%3A38626&show-proto-sidebar=1)
- **Okay, now I'm going to ask you to share your screen in Zoom** so that we can look at the prototype together and then we'll begin.
   - Zoom screensharing on desktop: Locate green Share Screen button on the bottom tool pane.
   - Zoom screensharing on mobile: Locate Share button in bottom tool panel (it's scrollable and they may need to scroll to see button if off screen), then hit "Start broadcast".
   - If they have trouble locating the chat or with sharing, talk them through finding the chat window to locate the prototype link and the Zoom screen sharing features.
   - Can actually do this while explaining to them where to find “Chat” and “Share,” so by the end we're looking at their screen, then move onto recording.
   - Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:
      - Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You can tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok? [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**
*Start recording.*
- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
1.	Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? 
-	Gather information regarding their background and determine if they're a Veteran, family member, personal representative, etc.
2.	Did you know that you could apply for a medallion for a deceased Veteran to be placed on their headstone or marker at any time? 
-	If yes, how did you find out?
-	If no, skip to question 3.
3.	Would this be something you’d be interested in applying for? 
- Yes or no, ask for the user to elaborate further.
- Alright, let's get to the prototype.
## Getting Started - 1 minute
- I'm going to give you a scenario for you to walk through of a prototype of this application and please give us your thoughts.
- The prototype link I shared is a work in progress, so there might be a few mistakes, or it may not function exactly the way you expect, which is ok. Some areas will be clickable and some will not and some fields will fill in when you click on them. Some of the questions you may not know the answer to, and that's ok.
- While you're going through the scenario, it would be really helpful if you'd think aloud - kind of like you'd do if you were talking to yourself. We are interested in your first reactions, what you're thinking & wondering as you go through the process. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn, so we want to hear your honest opinions. We're not testing your ability. We just want to improve the form to better meet Veteran's needs. We won't be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your feedback.
- When you think aloud, it helps us understand what works well and where we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free to ask them along the way. 
## First Task: [Funeral home applicant] - X minutes
- **Step 1:** You are Alex Wilson, a funeral home employee working for Wilson & Wilson. You want a medallion sent to you to place on a deceased Veteran’s headstone. You will complete the application from start to finish for the medallion. 
- **Step 2:** You are a cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an application.
### Things to watch for:
- **Introduction:** Does the participant read every section?
- **Whole application:** Does the participant feel they’d want to use the Need help guidance at any point?
- **Multiple sections:** Does the participant read the hint text “Check the email is correct before continuing..” and understand the importance of why?
- **Address validation:** Does the participant understand what to do next with standard address validation and not being able to verify an address? 
- **Veteran service periods:** Can the participant navigate adding, cancelling, editing, deleting service periods?
- **Burial information:** Is the wording for the questions in this section clear and easily understandable?
- **Burial information:** Does the applicant understand the cemetery will be signing a second form?
- **Memorial items:** Does the participant click on the learn more about types of sizes links, and feel this is adequate in terms of user experience?

- **Supporting documents:** Does the user spend time to read the supporting documents page?
- **Confirmation:** Does the user understand what will happen next in the application process and to look for an email?
- **Second form:** You completed the form and did great. The first task is done, so erase all that out of your mind. We are going to now start the second scenario we want to have you test. **Select button**. You are a cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an application. Again, you are a cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an application. 
- **Intro secondary form:** How does the participant feel about having to create an account?
## Second Task: [Family member applicant] - X minutes

## Post-Task Interview - X minutes
You’ve completed the task. Now we’re going to ask you some post task interview questions.
- **Question 1:** What did you think of the application process overall for both forms? 
- **Question 2:** On a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest, how would you rate the application process for Medallions you just experienced?
- **Question 3:** If you could snap your fingers and recreate the application process for Medallions to make it better or do things differently, what would that process look like? 
- **Question 4:** Is there anything else on your mind that we didn't ask? 
•	I'm going to ask my colleague [Charlie or Carly] if they have questions currently and also check the channel to see if any of our observers have any questions. [Check Teams chat for questions] 
•	Do you have any questions for me? 
## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.
Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!
## Emergency Exit
[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
