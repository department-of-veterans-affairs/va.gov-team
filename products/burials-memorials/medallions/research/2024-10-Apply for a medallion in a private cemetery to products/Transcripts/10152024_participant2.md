# Conversation Guide – Apply for a medallion in a private cemetery
## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] 
is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would 
like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...
Today we're going to talk about the process of applying for a Medallion for a
deceased Veteran to be placed in a private cemetery. A bit of background, in
this process the applicant will fill out a form for the medallion and submit. 
Then a second form, which is a shortened version of the first form, is sent to
the cemetery to review and sign. If approved, the medallion will be sent.
Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not
to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next 
question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no 
right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I 
welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any 
opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not 
have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate 
or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like 
to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at 
any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it 
was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-
check with you before we get going.
- **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
I prefer not
- **Are you on a desktop, mobile or tablet device?**  Desktop
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we
talk today? Yes
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay 
with me recording this session once more.**
*Start recording.*
- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I 
record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes
## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
1. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? I am a veteran and have 
family members that are veterans as well.
2. Did you know that you could apply for a medallion for a deceased 
Veteran to be placed on their headstone or marker at any time?  No.
3. Would this be something you’d be interested in applying for? I don’t 
know. What’s on the medallion. I mean I don’t know; I don’t know why I 
would want one or why a family member would want one.
## Getting Started - 1 minute
- I'm going to give you a scenario for you to walk through of a prototype of 
this application and please give us your thoughts.
- The prototype link I shared is a work in progress, so there might be a few 
mistakes, or it may not function exactly the way you expect, which is ok. 
Some areas will be clickable and some will not and some fields will fill in 
when you click on them. Some of the questions you may not know the 
answer to, and that's ok.
- While you're going through the scenario, it would be really helpful if you'd 
think aloud - kind of like you'd do if you were talking to yourself. We are 
interested in your first reactions, what you're thinking & wondering as you 
go through the process. The more you say about what you are thinking and 
wondering, the more we’ll learn, so we want to hear your honest opinions. 
We're not testing your ability. We just want to improve the form to better 
meet Veteran's needs. We won't be offended by any opinions you express, 
and we welcome your feedback.
- When you think aloud, it helps us understand what works well and where 
we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you 
have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free 
to ask them along the way.
## First Task: [Funeral home applicant]
- **Step 1:** You are Alex Wilson, a funeral home employee working for 
Wilson & Wilson. You want a medallion sent to you to place on a deceased 
Veteran’s headstone. You will complete the application from start to finish 
for the medallion.
I would need to click start the medallion application. Read the page. 
Arrow to the right because it is saying 1 of 7. Oh okay, am I putting my 
name or the veteran getting the medallion. I don’t understand the name. I 
am guess the person receiving the medallion. Why would I put in my name if
I am getting it for someone else. Why would my information matter if I am 
getting it for someone else. To me that is confusing. Save the application on 
each change. I guess I would be the representative of a funeral home. I 
guess now it makes sense but I don’t know because I am doing it for this 
unknown veteran it is still kind of confusing. Entering the name of the 
cemetery or funeral home. Organization contact information so the work 
email and number whatever it is. Then the address of the funeral home, that
is straightforward. Checking the address, if it one of those things that need 
the 9-digit zip code. Just yes click use think address. Now here’s the 
veterans name. The first part kind of makes sense but it was still confusing. 
I would have thought the veteran information would have come first. you 
said unknown veteran so what would their name be. I don’t know their SSN 
and DOB isa required but I assume I would know that. If they are an 
unknown person how would you know it if they require it. I guess if it is 
required you would know. SSN isn’t required but DOB is. Date of death you 
would know because of the death certificate. Unless I know the birth city I 
would leave it blank. If I knew I would answer the demographics but now 
days it can be challenging. I would say no unless I knew for sure. Lets say 
yes but then I would need to go off of the death certificate. Veteran 
ethnicity, if I didn’t know for sure I would click prefer not to answer. Do I 
know this person is Hispanic. I would say prefer not to answer which is 
good. The veterans sex I would hope I would know if its male or female, I 
have never seen a death certificate. If I am doing this for a loved one I 
would know. Um branch of service, as the funeral home person how would I 
know this information if they are an unknown veteran. If it’s a family 
member it is easier to know or easier to find out. As a funeral home worker 
how would I know that. It would have to be given to me because I wouldn’t 
know their military information. If it’s a family member they would know or 
be able to find out. I guess just put things in there. I think if you are going 
to ask questions about service information, I think there should be 
something there at the beginning to let you know what to have in order to 
complete the form. It would be helpful to know. Someone may say the 
Vietnam war but that was a long time so it may need to be looked up. 
Claimed remains, in this example it is an unknown or unclaimed person so 
no. Uh there’s no asterisk so I don’t have to answer it but as a funeral home 
worker I would no for sure right. Gravestone, that would be something you 
can find out if they have one. If they don’t are you not eligible or do you just
assume that everyone that comes here already ahs one. do they order this at
the same time. You have to have a gravestone to have one right. Lets say 
yes. Enter the century name like evergreen Cemetery and that information 
can be found easily. Cemetery contact, okay so yeah you would need to find 
that out. the caretaker and their contact information. Yeah. Cemetery 
address, which is easy to find the physical address. Looking at the address 
to see the different. They look the same, I don’t see the difference. I would 
need to double check which address is correct, if I typed it correctly I would
click the one I typed. I believe it would be a new medallion. Broze or medal 
of honor, I don’t know which one there should be an explanation of the 
difference. Lets just go with bronze. Size of medallion I think that would be 
a preference. Presidential memorial certification, I would need to click learn
more about it but lets say yes here. How many certifications do you want, 
you cannot request more than 99. Why would I want more than 1. Do you 
give them to people. To me I guess I would need to google the explanation. I
don’t know why I would want more than 1. Like do you give them to people. 
DD-214 is standard. Okay that makes sense. Okay so they tell you want to 
upload them you submit it; you could mail it in as well. I would submit it 
electronically. I wouldn’t fax it btu it’s a good option. Some people like 
postal service or fax. Statement of trust I can click on it and it check the 
information. I would if I were doing this. My full name would go in there 
then check the box that you read it and continue. Continue tells you there is
still have more to do, it should say submit. I would copy and print this off so 
I have a record of when it was sent out.
- **Step 2:** You are a cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an 
application.
## Second Task: [Family member applicant]
- **Step 1:** You are Alex Wilson, a family member of the deceased Veteran. 
You want to send the medallion to your brother to place on the Veteran’s 
headstone. You will complete the application from start to finish.
- **Step 2:** You are a cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an 
application.
- **Second form:** You completed the form and did great. The first task is 
done, so erase all that out of your mind. We are going to now start the 
second scenario we want to have you test. **Select button**. You are a 
cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an application. Again, you are
a cemetery official reviewing and signing off on an application.
Scrolling down so I can read. Identity verified account like ID.me and 
all that stuff. Sign in or create account. Veteran details okay. Checking the 
cemetery and go on. Medallion details and look it over. Recipient 
information, okay. Alright so if I wanted I can check the boxes then scroll 
down and read it, sign and check the box and submit application. Why does 
this one say submit but the other had continue. Yes submit application.
- **Intro secondary form:** How does the participant feel about having to 
create an account?
## Post-Task Interview
You’ve completed the task. Now we’re going to ask you some post task 
interview questions.
- **Question 1:** What did you think of the application process overall for 
both forms? Um for the most part they were relativity easy to do and follow. 
They were kind of confusing at points but overall straight forward.
- **Question 2:** On a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being the lowest and 5 being 
the highest, how would you rate the application process for Medallions you 
just experienced? 4.
- **Question 3:** If you could snap your fingers and recreate the application 
process for Medallions to make it better or do things differently, what would
that process look like?  I think the beginning should be context of what you 
are doing in the application and what you need such as the veterans service 
information, Dob and stuff like that. Some people may not be aware of that 
if you are talking about a deceased loved one. more information on the front
end it would be less stressful.
- **Question 4:** Is there anything else on your mind that we didn't ask?  
You didn’t put cost; how much would it be.
• I'm going to ask my colleague [Charlie or Carly] if they have questions
currently and also check the channel to see if any of our observers have any
questions. [Check Teams chat for questions]  No questions
• Do you have any questions for me? No, this is something they are 
looking at doing now. Okay. I don’t understand why someone would want a 
medal on the tome stone. They steal stuff off of graves like flower. You can’t 
really steal a tomb stone but people steal flowers and teddy bears all the 
time.
## Thank-You and Closing
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us
today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little 
blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide
