## Research Goals
_The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) is working to modernize its systems, including the system that processes medallion applications (Form 40-1330M) for determining eligibility for a government medallion to affix to a private marker (VA Form 40-1330M). Currently, family members, VSO officers, funeral homes, cemeteries, and personal representatives do not have a digitized form that allows them to request a medallion for a Veteran buried in a private cemetery with a privately purchased headstone or marker. The Medallions application applies to life stage of Dying, as Veteran’s family members, personal representatives, or Veteran Service Officers can apply for a medallion to affix to a private marker in a private cemetery at the time of death – or at any point after the Veteran’s death._
_[See the Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)_

The purpose of this research was to:
- Goal 1: Design a form that is straightforward and inclusive of the information needed to determine eligibility for a medallion. 
- Goal 2: Test the usability of the medallions digital form and multiple signature solution to ensure that it is easily usable and accessible for applicants. 
- Goal 3: Identify pain points that may hinder user’s ability to complete the form and multiple signature solution, confirming users understand the application process thoroughly from beginning to end. 
_


## Research Questions

-	*Are users adequately equipped to begin this form, ensuring confidence throughout its completion?*
-	*Does the content adhere to the most intuitive and user-friendly experience?*
-	*What specific sections of our form pose the greatest challenges for users?* 
-	*Is the form’s structure proficient in guiding users through the process?* 
-	*Does the organization and content provided help guide the users step-by-step?* 
-	*What can we do to streamline the information for users to make it clearer and easier to understand?* 
-	*What questions do users have before and after completing the form?*



## Methodology 

We conducted remote usability testing sessions with Zoom using a clickable, interactive prototype of the Medallion and Multiple Signatures designs.
Participants were given a link to open the prototype that they could navigate through to complete a scenario assigned to them. 
[Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/QIMsAdHJjctTKDM1I34uXV/Medallions---Baseline-Prototype?page-id=2%3A2&node-id=2185-38626&node-type=frame&t=5Wtgi4V942WneqD4-0&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=3409%3A40654)

Users were interviewed about their prior Medallions knowledge in addition to being asked questions to assess how experienced they are with VA.gov digital forms.

Notes from the moderator, notetakers, and observers were then synthesized to form findings and recommendations._

**Scenarios**
- 4 Participants completed the application as a Veteran's family member
- 4 Participants completed the application as a funeral home representative
- All participants were asked to fill out the second form as a cemetery representative


## Hypotheses and Conclusions


- **Understand the language used to differentiate between applicant and Veteran**
  - TRUE  Users generally understood whose information to enter in the applicant and Veteran information sections.
- **Find the form straight to the point and user friendly**
  - DEFINITELY TRUE  All users found the form to be simple and straightforward. 
- **Be able to move through the form and ultimately order a medallion for the Veteran quickly and with ease**
  -	DEFINITELY TRUE –All users were able to complete both the medallions and multiple signatures forms.
- **Spend less time reading and more time getting through questions quickly based on conciseness**
  -	LIKELY TRUE Users were able to navigate through the forms quickly, stopping for help if needed using the links and additional help components.
- **Understand the requirements needed to apply for a medallion and multiple signatures** 
  -	MAYBE TRUE  Users understood what was needed to apply for a medallion, and that there would be a second signature required by the cemetery after the first  form had been completed. 
- **Experience confusion on who is eligible for this benefit**
  - LIKELY FALSE Users generally understood who would be eligible for this benefit, but we found that some additional guidance is needed to better explain the requirements specifically for a Medal of Honor medallion.
- **Have questions about what happens after they apply and how the multiple signature process works**
  -	LIKELY FALSE Users generally understood that they would need an additional second signature to be able to receive this benefit.

## Details of Findings 

_To add images: ![text](link - add image to github folder and link here with .png)_


**1. Nearly all participants felt reassured by the help links and additional info components**

Labels: PRDT: Burials-memorials, BNFT: Memorialization 

- 7/8 participants utilized additional info components or help links throughout the application.
- Several participants said that they would call the help line with questions about the application process.
- 1 participant explained that they like the link to open in a new tab so that it would not disrupt the current application process.
- 1 participant said that they would use the help to obtain information about the cemetery contact.



> _“I like that you have the link where you can learn more about stuff. - Having to learn more about it would be helpful because I don’t have a clue of what it is.” - P13_

> _“Presidential memorial certificate, I would need to click learn more about it” - P2_

> _“I like that the learn more opens in a different tab so it doesn’t interrupt the application.” - P3_

> _"As I am going through this and I see continue, my eyes go to need help and I can call the 800 number from M-F from 8am to 730pm if I have questions. Even with it being there I can I know it’s there and I can call with questions.” - P4_

> _“You can get the presidential memorial and the learn more opens in a different tab so that’s nice. I can click on it to learn and I would like it so click yes.” - P4_

> _“I would click on the certificate link because I don’t know what it is from the title”  - P6_

**2. Nearly all participants opted in to Veteran demographics questions.**

Labels: PRDT: Burials-memorials, BNFT: Memorialization

-	7/8 participants opted in to Veteran demographic questions.
-	1 participant opted out of Veteran demographic questions because they said they would not know that information as an organization contact (funeral home.)
-	1 participant said that they would not answer the demographics questions unless they knew for sure, or they would select “prefer not to answer.”
-	1 participant did not like the “prefer not to answer” answer for race, ethnicity, or sex questions.

> _“I would voluntarily answer the demographics.” - P4_

> _“Okay, sure. I guess because on my background I work in the science field so it helps with that statistics. It’s not personal information so it doesn’t feel wrong.” P6_

>_“If I knew I would answer the demographics but nowadays it can be challenging. I would say no unless I knew for sure.” – P2_

>_“Race and gender is fine I would select yes. That page is fine to me it is just asking race, its fine to me.” – P12_

>_“I don’t have a problem with the demographic question so I would put yes. P7"_



**3. Some participants were hesitant to enter Veteran information if they didn’t know for sure.**

> _“I don’t have a problem with the demographic question so I would put yes. P7”_

**4. Most participants generally understood the burial and claimed remains topics but had questions about eligibility with cremation.**

Labels: PRDT: Burials-memorials, BNFT: Memorialization

- Most participants thought the question “Are the Veteran’s remains buried in their grave?” as clear.
- 3 participants wondered about cremated remains and how that would affect the process.
- 1 participant suggested that “unclaimed” remains meant that the Veteran was also “unknown.”
- Most participants understood who the ‘next of kin’ would be.

>_“Burial location, this is confusing me a little bit. If I am new to this process I would assume they are in a coffin or maybe cremated would be a different option?” - P4_ 

>_“Remains claimed, it is making sure whoever the next of kin is has possession of the remains or knows where they are.” - P3_

>_“Buried in their grave yes unless they are cremated.” – P10_

>_“Next of kin, clicked the drop down. I would click yes. Buried in their grave, Yeah I think it is clear. ” – P13_


**5. Some participants experienced confusion around medallion type and sizing.**

Labels: PRDT: Burials-memorials, BNFT: Memorialization

-	Most participants understood that the Medal of Honor was not for everyone, and that you would need additional eligibility to receive that medallion. 
-	Most participants think the medallion sizing is a preference. 
-	2 participants wish for a more visual presentation of the medallions on an actual headstone.
-	1 participant suggested that the size of the medallion could be based on how long the Veteran had served.
-	2 participants said they would click the link to learn more about medallion types and sizes.

>_" I assume bronze is for another and medal of honor is if they received a medal of honor. Bigger medallion is always better.” - P3_

>_“Size of medallion I think that would be a preference.” – P2_

> _“Bronze or Medal of Honor, I don’t know which one there should be an explanation of the difference.” - P2_
> _“The sizes are medium and large. I am still curious of the actual size.” – P4_

> _“Learning about the sizes could be beneficial, I guess maybe learning about how big they would be on the certain headstone and stuff. I was just thinking, the small one looks tiny so I was thinking how it would look in relation to a headstone. The dimensions  are there, but I am visual learner and just reading the numbers don’t mean much to me. I like the picture.” P12_

>_“So the link just says learn more about the sizes so that tells me more about the sizes, not what they each mean. I think the picture helps and there are sizes under the list. It is nice to compare it to a coin for visual reference maybe some people will see the dimensions and be like ‘cool.’” - P6_

**6. All participants understood the two-part application process, saying it was quick and straightforward.**

Labels: PRDT: Burials-memorials, BNFT: Memorialization

-	Participants understood the two-part application process, and thought it was quick, straight-forward and user friendly.
-	Participants gave the Medallions and Multiple Signatures forms an overall rating of 4.5/5.
-	3 participants referenced other VA.gov and said it fit well with the other forms, and that it was clearer and easier than others they have completed.


>_“ I liked it and it reminds me of other government forms but clearer than some I have done. So that’s nice.” – P13_
>
>_“It fits well with the VA forms. Easy to fill and follow. … The second was very polished well but the first one I can fumble through without having been through the process before.” – P4_

>_“I would give it a 5, it was the easiest applications I’ve done on the VA app.” - P10_

>“It was straightforward. I didn’t see anything that would cause confusion or couldn’t find. I don’t see how anyone would be hindered on the process of applying.” – P3_

>“Regarding the process itself I would give a 4/4.5 because of how they work together. Excellent process for everyone to be on the same page of things.” – P4_

**7. Address validation was familiar and easily understood by most participants.**

Labels: PRDT: Burials-memorials, BNFT: Memorialization

-	Address Validation is familiar to most users, but there was some confusion with test data and knowing what the differences were between the suggested and entered addresses. 
-	Participants generally understood what was being asked of them, and how they would proceed through address validation.
-	Participants were careful to double check their address information when prompted with an alert. 
-	Most participants knew to continue if they thought their information was correct.

>_"I would need to double check which address is correct, if I typed it correctly I would click the one I typed.” – P2_

>_“This tells me I want to make sure it is correct even though it wasn’t pulled up in the postal information. If it was correct I would use it and if it wasn’t I would edit it then come back here.”-  P4_

>_“I would check to make sure I didn’t type anything wrong. I would still just use this address.” - P7_

>_“The address entered against the suggested address is good because you can pick the correct one. That’s a good placement. I would like the suggested address to be a different color so I knew they were separate; it would show that they are different.” – P7_


## Recommendations

1. Add help text in the demographics section to further explain the "prefer not to answer” option.
2. Explore content additions for additional help in finding important Veteran's information.
3. Explore content improvements to better explain "unclaimed remains" with an additional info component instead of defining ‘next of kin.’
4. Explore content improvements to better explain medallion sizing.
5. Provide hint text for medal of honor eligibility, citing documents that will be needed as evidence for this benefit.
6. Provide additional help with sizing requirements and possible cemetery restrictions.


## Next Steps

* Share findings with stakeholders and other teams working on VA.gov
* Review recommendations
* Update the Medallions prototype to incorporate agreed-upon recommendations
* Begin epic creation

## Secondary research

**Secondary findings**
1. Most participants saw the benefit of filling out as much information as they could, regardless of non-required labeling. However, 2 participants stated that they would leave non-required fields blank, and 1 participant thought that the non-required fields were less important to the process.
2. Most participants understood Applicant vs Veteran terminology, but 1 participant had expressed confusion on who the “applicant” was and why that information was needed if the benefit is for a Veteran.
3. 2 participants were confused about the “personal representative” title compared to the “family member” title and wondered if they could be both. 
4. All participants understood and successfully navigated through the service periods component.
5. Participants reacted positively to the Presidential Memorial Certificate, and expressed interest in learning more about it, or said they would order 1 or more.
