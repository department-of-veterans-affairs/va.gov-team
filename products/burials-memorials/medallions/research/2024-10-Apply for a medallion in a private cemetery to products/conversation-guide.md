## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 
Today we're going to talk about [the process of applying for a Medallion for a deceased Veteran to be placed in a private cemetery. A bit of background, in this process the applicant will fill out a form for the medallion and submit. Then a second form, which is a shortened version of the first form, is sent to the cemetery to review and sign. If approved, the medallion will be sent.]
Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- (If applicable) **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - Knowing this, **would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**
*Start recording.*
- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

## Consent to use video clips

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.
Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit
[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
