## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 
Today we're going to talk about [the process of applying for a Medallion for a deceased Veteran to be placed in a private cemetery. A bit of background, in this process the applicant will fill out a form for the medallion and submit. Then a second form, which is a shortened version of the first form, is sent to the cemetery to review and sign. If approved, the medallion will be sent.]
Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
   - Are you on a desktop, mobile or tablet device?
   - I'm going to send you a link in the chat that I would like for you to open. [Link]
- **Device and browser** Are you using a computer or mobile phone during our session today?
   - Mac or Windows
   - iOS or Android?
- **What browser are you using today?**
- **If not joined by Zoom already**, Do you have Zoom installed?
- **Do you have a screen reader on this device?**
   - What kind of screen reader do you use?
   - Are you wearing headphones today? If so, would it be possible for you to take them off and use your computer or mobile audio? I'm asking so that I can hear your screen reader during the session.
   - How long have you been using it?
   - Do you know your screen reader's speaking rate (verbosity setting)? High, medium, low?
      - If high, be prepared to have them repeat anything that can't be heard or understood
   - I may need to pause you at times and ask you what you're hearing if I can't make out what's being read.
   - Are you using a screen magnifier today?
   - Are there any other assistive technologies that you use?
      - If the participant has low vision, they may require captions which needs to be turned on in advanced settings
        
- **Okay, now I'm going to ask you to share your screen in Zoom** so that we can look at the prototype together and then we'll begin.
   - Zoom screensharing on desktop: Locate green Share Screen button on the bottom tool pane.
   - Zoom screensharing on mobile: Locate Share button in bottom tool panel (it's scrollable and they may need to scroll to see button if off screen), then hit "Start broadcast".
   - If they have trouble locating the chat or with sharing, talk them through finding the chat window to locate the prototype link and the Zoom screen sharing features. Zoom share screen directions
   - Can actually do this while explaining to them where to find “Chat” and “Share,” so by the end we're looking at their screen, then move onto recording.
   - Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:
      - Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and
        then I'm going to have you "Drive". You can tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok? [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

- (If applicable) **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - Knowing this, **would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**
*Start recording.*
- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

## Consent to use video clips

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit
[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
