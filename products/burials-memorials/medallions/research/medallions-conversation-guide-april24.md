### Starting the session

In the Participant window, tap the More drop-down arrow and make sure "Play join and leave sound" is unchecked. 
Check your _screensharing setup_. Make sure you are setup on Zoom app and ready to screenshare in case participant can't. 
When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro. 
 
## Intro - 5 minutes 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is _NAME_ and I am _ROLE AND POSITION._ _NOTETAKER NAME_ is taking notes. 

I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...  

Today we're going to review the prototype of the VA medallions application. This form allows an applicant to request a medallion for a Veteran gravesite to be affixed to a private marker or headstone. We are testing a new form and it is important for us to get feedback from users.  

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you: 

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. 

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. 

- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know. 

- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?** 

   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom. 

   - If yes: Admit observers. 

   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.) 

   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth 

- (If applicable) **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits. 

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7. 

   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? 

- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed. 

   - Knowing this, **would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?** 

   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.* 

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes 

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions. 

Can you briefly tell me about your background with the military? _Determine if they are a family member, personal representative, cemetery official, or other_ 
 Did you know that you could request a medallion to be affixed to a Veterans grave?  
If yes, how did you find out? 
If no, would you be interested in applying for one? Why or why not? 
Have you ever applied for another burial item from VA.gov, such as a headstone or marker, burial flag, or urn?  
If yes, what was your experience? 
If no, is this something you would be interested in doing?  
What do you think qualifies a person to receive a medallion? 
**Getting Started:** 

When applying to see if you're eligible for a medallion to affix to a Veteran’s grave, the VA Medallions form can be used. I'm going to give you a scenario for you to walk through a prototype of this application and please give us your thoughts. 
The prototype link I shared is a work in progress, so there might be a few mistakes, or it may not function exactly the way you expect, which is ok. Some areas will be clickable and some will not. Some fields will fill in automatically when you click on them. 
While you're going through the scenario, it would be helpful if you'd think aloud like you'd do if you were talking to yourself. We are interested in your first reactions, what you're thinking & wondering as you go through the process. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn, so we want to hear your honest opinions. We're not testing your abilities. We just want to improve the form to better meet Veteran's needs. We won't be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your feedback. 
When you think aloud, it helps us understand what works well and where we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you have questions, it’s likely that many others will, as well, so feel free to ask them along the way.

If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip? 
## Thank You and Closing - X minute 

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. 
Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies. 
Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day. 
## Emergency Exit 

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an _emergency exit strategy_(https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies).  
Plan to include here at least one option, so it’s easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.
