Findings to Incorporate

These findings will be included our work to drive improved outcomes

Simple language changes could reduce Survivor confusion

Based on their research the Non-disability Benefits team recommended the following changes:   
Define each type of allowance, especially the transportation allowance  
Define terms that Survivors find confusing: service-connected, file number, and place of interment  
Clarify the amount of reimbursement that a Survivor can receive  
Set expectations about the timeline for obtaining supporting documents

Simple language changes could reduce Survivor confusion, cont.

Based on their research the Non-disability Benefits team recommended the following changes:   
Clarify that the payment is a reimbursement to the person who paid for the burial expenses. Consider changing the language of “allowance” to “reimbursement”

9  
Confidence: Medium- Found in only one study, but study was thorough, recent, and relevant  
Recommended Next Step: Incorporate these findings into the form design

Findings to incorporate  
Screenshot from the “Veterans burial allowance and transportation benefits” section of VA.gov showing a mix of  “allowance” and “reimbursement” language

Taking advantage of the digital format could improve the burial benefit application process

Suggestions of specific ways to utilize the digital format included:  
Using short videos to convey instructions  
Linking directly to important information  
Auto-populating as much of the application form as possible  
Optimizing the experience for mobile users

10  
Confidence: Medium- Much of the information came from research conducted with Veterans and Survivors, but focused on pre-planning communication  
Recommended Next Step: Test these suggestions with potential users

Findings to incorporate

Acknowledge Survivors’ experiences

Reflecting Survivors’ experiences could look like:  
Making sure that a wide variety of Survivors are considered and represented. Male Survivors and Siblings have historically not had as many resources available to them  
Acknowledging the support that Survivors provided for their Veteran and the sacrifices that they made  
11  
Confidence: High- Data was consistent across multiple studies  
Recommended Next Step: Incorporate these findings into the form design

Findings to incorporate

VSOs recommended  changes to the benefit form and application process to reduce the burden on Survivors

Their suggestions to improve the benefits application experience for Survivors were to:  
Verify all necessary information is included before form submission  
Streamline the application process if a Survivor is applying for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) and burial benefits  
Encourage Survivors to work with an advocate and make it easy to contact them  
Add bank information to the form so that funds can be reimbursed directly  
12  
Confidence: Medium- Found primarily in one study  
Recommended Next Step: Test these suggestions with potential users

Findings to incorporate

Whether or not a Veteran used VA benefits before they passed can impact the application process

If VA has already verified a Veteran’s military history the Survivor may not need to provide this information again.

13  
Confidence: Medium- Found in only one study, but study was thorough, recent, and relevant  
Recommended Next Step: Confirm this information with VSOs and/or VA

Findings to incorporate

Findings which Provide Context

These findings will influence our work, but we will not directly effect change in these areas

Survivors are often filling out the application during a time of immense grief

Benefit claimants are usually extremely close to a Veteran: their spouse and/or children  
Veterans’ benefits end when they pass away which can cause financial hardship for families  
Navigating the process of a benefit application can be difficult in the best of circumstances, let alone while adjusting to a loss  
Stress can affect cognitive functioning  
15  
Findings which provide context

Some Survivor groups may be less comfortable engaging with VA

Several factors were identified in research which might make Survivors less comfortable engaging with VA, or might make it harder for them to engage with VA, including:  
Survivors with language or cultural barriers  
Survivors who don't have access to technology or aren't comfortable using it  
Survivors who live farther from VA facilities  
Survivors who aren’t connected to the military, VA, VSOs, or other Survivors  
16  
Findings which provide context

The burial benefits application process is difficult for Survivors

Research identified several specific Survivor pain points in the application process:  
Survivors often have limited awareness of benefits  
Survivors who are aware of benefits may not understand the details, for example that the burial benefit does not cover all funeral expenses  
The process is long and delays are common, mostly due to needing supporting docs  
Survivors may not have all of the information required to complete the application, such as required military history info  
Survivors have limited insight into the status of an application while it is being processed  
Having a positive experience with the benefits process is key to maintaining Survivors’ trust in VA  
17  
Findings which provide context

VSOs provide a wide variety of support to Survivors

Receiving support in the burial benefits process is key to Survivors’ success. In addition to assisting Survivors with the burial benefits forms, VSOs:  
Advise Survivors on what to include on the death certificate, if the cause of death was service-connected this affects benefits  
Help Survivors obtain supporting evidence  
Support Survivors with language barriers

18

Findings to Share

These findings are most relevant to parts of the burial benefits process outside of the 530EZ form. They may be helpful to other burial benefits teams

Benefit outreach, especially before the Veteran passes, is important

Outreach is crucial to helping survivors learn about benefits. If Survivors do not know that benefits exist, or aren’t reminded about them, they are at risk of missing out.  
The process of obtaining benefits is much smoother for Survivors if they begin preparing before the Veterans’ death. Proactive outreach should:  
seek to include family members, not just the Veteran, in preplanning   
inform family members about the type of information that is needed when applying for benefits  
be inclusive of different types of Survivors

20  
Findings to share

Survivors benefit from, and should have access to, many types of support

Sources of support mentioned in research include:   
VHA's Compassionate Contact Corps  
VHA chaplains   
grief counseling at Vet Centers  
benefit counselors  
comprehensive case management  
a dedicated point of contact at VA   
community resources  
VSOs  
other Survivors  
21  
Findings to share

If VSO and Survivor advocates are not adequately informed, the claims they submit are of lower quality

In order to increase the effectiveness of VA partners, research suggested that VA should:   
provide channels for partners to ask questions  
assess, standardize, and update training materials  
partner with funeral homes and create tools that meet their needs  
22  
Findings to share

VA processes for after a Survivor passes could be improved by making them more proactive and automated

Suggestions for improvements to VA processes included:  
Mailing packets of relevant information after a Veteran's passing  
Contacting Survivors to confirm VA support during difficult times  
Automating acknowledgment of passing, such as automatically sending families their presidential letter  
Coordinating death notices across VA

Other suggestions for improvements to the burial benefit process included improving the phone support experience, providing benefits within 30 \- 60 days, making changes to the benefit letter and paper form, and granting VSOs access to VA.gov.  
23  
Findings to share

When Survivors are minors there are additional factors to be considered

Age-appropriate grief counseling should be provided.   
VA should continue to connect with the guardian and Survivor about benefits as the Survivor grows.

Confidence Rating  
Creating confidence ratings for qualitative research findings requires making some subjective judgments. When rating I focused on two main factors:    
The number of studies that included a particular finding  
The type of participants included in the study  
Participants included Veterans, Survivors, VSO staff members, VA staff members, and end-of-life professionals  
It was not always possible to determine who shared what information  
I did my best to prioritize information from, or studies with, Survivors, then those who work with Survivors, then Veterans
