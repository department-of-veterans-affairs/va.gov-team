# Burial Benefit Desk Research   

As part of the Pension and Burial Benefits team taking on the work of updating the VA Form 21P-530EZ, Application for Burial Benefits, we conducted a review of related existing research.   
This allowed us to:   
- better understand the current Survivor experience
- avoid duplicating previous efforts
- discover resources that inform and support our work
- form the basis for future research efforts

**Step 1: Found relevant research**   
- Reviewed research conducted by the Non-Disability Benefit team, searched the research repository in EnjoyHQ as well as Slack
- Documented previous burial research including when it was conducted, who it was conducted by, where to access it, and any relevant information
- Saved the [audit information](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/burials-memorials/Desk%20Research/Burial%20Benefit%20Desk%20Research%20Audit%20Findings.md) in this folder
  
**Step 2: Analyze relevant research**   
- Copied the relevant information into Mural and affinity mapped it
- Summarized each cluster of information
- Documented the findings and next steps
- Saved the information in this folder, in both [PDF] (**add here**) and [plain text](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/burials-memorials/Desk%20Research/Burial%20Benefit%20Desk%20Research%20Findings%20Presentation_plain%20text.md) formats

**Next Steps: Possible Initiatives**   
- Conduct a design and content audit
- Implement low-hanging changes from the content audit and plain language recommendations from the desk research
- Implement the ability to skip adding military info in the 530EZ Burial Benefits form if the Veteran had received VA benefits
- Test findings or concepts from the desk research and content audit that were noted as needing Survivor feedback
- Conduct a content review of the static introductory page on VA.gov
- Create a burial journey map
- Create a form flow for the digital 530EZ Burial Benefit form
