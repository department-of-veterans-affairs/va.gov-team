**Summary:** “VA Form 21P-530 (Application for Burial Benefits) enables eligible individuals to apply for compensation to help cover burial, plot, and transportation costs. We know this form is “often the first time a Veteranʼs family interacts directly with VA is during a high-emotional time of a Veteranʼs Death. Our team aimed to better understand the claimantsʼ mental models regarding the Burial Benefits form, primarily through the insights of Veterans Service Officers (VSOs), County Veterans Service Officers (CVSOs), and National Service Officers (NSOs). We aimed to identify which sections of the form need clarification and what factors create obstacles, such as drop-offs and delays in the application process.”  
**Relevant Findings:**  
Findings   
1\. The typical claimants are spouses and children of the deceased Veteran. VSOs rarely work with extended family, friends, caregivers, funeral homes, state cemeteries and executors.  
2\. Claimants face emotional challenges, including grief and the stress of navigating bureaucratic processes during a time of loss  
3\. VSOs support Veterans' end-of-life journey by preparing them and their families for burial benefits.  
4\. VSOs have indicated that application process delays are common, primarily due to the need for supporting documents. These delays can range from 7 days to 90 days and, in rare instances, may extend up to a year.  
5\. VSOs help obtain supporting evidence during the Burial Benefits application process and reduce delays.  
6\. Many claimants mistakenly believe Burial Benefits will fully cover funeral expenses, unaware it is a reimbursement for specific costs, not a full payment for services  
7\. Claimants find some of the terminology used in the form confusing and hard to understand.  
8\. VSOs offer DIC benefits to surviving spouses and suggest streamlining the process for service-connected Veterans. Requires additional validation.  
Secondary Findings  
1\. Some VSOs advise claimants on what to include in their death certificate to max out benefits from VA.   
2\. VSOs provide support to claimants with language barriers  
3\. VSOs suggested improvements to the Burial Benefits form, including adding bank information fields for direct reimbursements.   
4\. VSOs suggest a 30-60-day timeframe to receive the Burial Benefits  
5\. VSOs suggested improvements to the award letter and the paper form and other additional suggestions.  
6\. Some claimants are unaware of VA and Burial Benefits, resulting in some missing out on years of benefits they are entitled to.   
7\. VSO recommendations: contacting claimants, mailing information packets after a Veteran's passing, automatically sending families their presidential letter, and granting VSOs access to VA.gov.  
8\. VSO tools: Vetraspec, Vetspro, Tyler Veteranʼs Benefits, Quick submit, and VA.gov  
Further Research Needed  
1\. Claimants might incur additional fees to obtain supporting documentation.  
2\. Some claimants might face name change challenges.  
3\. Some VSOs mentioned that some claimants can face challenges if the Veteran never taps into VA benefits.  
4\. Some VSOs mentioned funeral homes are proactive in helping claimants complete the Burial benefits form. In contrast, others could take advantage of claimants unfamiliar with it.  
5\. Claimants might get confused about tribal contributions about related to Q19A, and others might have issues with supplemental claims.  
Recommendations  
1\. HMW put less burden to claimants during the Burial Benefits application process  
2\. Consider automating and auto-populating as much information we can about the deceased Veteran  
3\. Ensure that we are preparing Veterans and their families for the death of the Veteran  
4\. HMW leverage ways VSOs prepare Veteranʼs and their families into our digital space?  
5\. HMW reach out to claimants after the death of a Veteran?  
6\. Clearly outline the expected time frames for obtaining supporting documents.  
7\. Review the checklist one of the VSO participants shared that's used to ensure claimants know what supporting documents. HMW provide this service digitally?  
8\. Identify if the claimant or the deceased Veteran is already receiving VA benefits. We might not need military information for these claimants since the VA has already verified their military history.  
9\. Ensure claimants have included all the necessary information and supporting documents before they submit the form.  
10\. Set the expectation that the VA will not cover all expenses but only a small portion.  
11\. Incorporate additional information about how much reimbursement a claimant can get when they apply for Burial Benefits.  
12\. Include the maximum and minimum amounts someone might get depending on their  
eligibility in the paper form.  
13\. Change “allowance” to “reimbursement” so claimants understand that receipts are needed to claim Burial Benefits and further explain that the person incurring the expenses should be the person claiming the benefit.  
14\. Explain each type of allowance, specifically transportation allowances, and various scenarios where transportation expenses could be reimbursed  
15\. Consider using plain language throughout the form.  
16\. Provide more explanations regarding these terms online and on the paper form: service-connected, not service-connected, file number, and place of interment.  
17\. Research the connection between DIC and Burial Benefits. Thereʼs an opportunity to bring awareness to the DIC in the Burial Benefits paper form and online form and vice versa. Thereʼs also an opportunity to streamline the process, where we can guide a surviving spouse to apply for DIC first if the Veteran passes away from service-connected implications  
Next Steps

- Pension Burial team can share this deck and report with their VBA partners  
- Incorporate findings into the following Burial Benefits enhancement  
- To verify the findings in this research, additional research should be conducted involving spouses, children, extended family, friends, caregivers, funeral homes, state cemeteries, and executors, while ensuring an emotionally sensitive approach to carry out this research.  
- Research the connection between DIC and Burial Benefits. Thereʼs an opportunity to bring awareness to the DIC in the Burial Benefits paper form and online form and vice versa. Thereʼs also an opportunity to streamline the process, where we can guide a surviving spouse to apply for DIC first if the Veteran passes away from service-connected implications. Include bank information on the paper and online forms so claimants can get reimbursement faster.   
- Consider using plain language throughout the form.  
- Explain each type of allowance, specifically transportation allowances, and various scenarios where transportation expenses could be reimbursed.

**Summary:** “The Veterans Experience Office (VEO) and the Office of Survivors Assistance (OSA) collaborated to understand Survivor experiences with accessing VA benefits and services. Starting in FY 2019, OSA partnered with VEO to explore Survivors' interactions with the VA, leading to prototype solutions in FY20 to enhance Survivor experiences. In October 2023, OSA reengaged with VEO to expand upon the 2019 Survivor research, update journey maps, and develop a survey instrument to measure Survivor sentiment and trust in VA benefits and services. . . . A qualitative study was conducted with Survivors and subject matter experts (SMEs), utilizing one-to-one interviews and document analysis. Data was analyzed thematically to uncover insights and inform the development of strategies for enhancing the Survivor experience.”  
**Relevant Findings:**   
Acknowledging and Honoring the Contributions of Survivors  
Survivors want to be recognized and acknowledged for the critical role they played supporting their Veteran and want to be honored and respected for their sacrifices in support of their loved one.  
Opportunities

- Extend VA outreach to provide comprehensive support to Survivors.  
- Include Spouses and Survivors in pre-death planning including information on Survivor benefits.  
- Comprehensive case management for Survivors.  
- Automate acknowledgement of Veterans passing with recognition of the role of the Survivor.  
- Create a consolidated resource that is personalized to the needs of Survivors. 

Navigating Resources While Grieving  
Limited awareness of Survivor benefits adds to the challenge of accessing resources during the grieving process.  
	Opportunities

- Increase the marketing (messaging and communications) of Survivor benefits.  
- Partner with funeral homes to identify untethered Survivors and provide more education on Survivor services and benefits.  
- Provide timely information to Survivors on their eligibility for benefits.  
- Assist the Survivor through the process and navigating resources 

Personalized and Proactive Outreach  
Survivors seek a compassionate single point of contact to assist them in navigating the complexities of Survivor benefits.  
Opportunities

- Proactively reach out to Survivors upon notice of death and automate the delivery of empathetic communications.  
- Provide a similar experience to active duty servicemembers by providing a single point of contact.  
- Improve awareness of Vet Centers grief counseling services and local community resources.  
- Employ the use of VHA chaplains for compassionate outreach.  
- Engage with VHA’s Compassionate Contact Corps.  
- Ensure coordination of death notices across administrations.  
- Implement standardized education programs for VSOs to enhance the Survivor experience and underscore the significance of their role in supporting the VA. 

Modernizing Systems  
Survivors express frustration with the manual, offline, nature of the process and the absence of transparency and self-service digital and technology-based alternatives.  
Opportunities

- Improve digital access for submitting and tracking Survivor claims.  
- Modernize the education of VA staff and community partners, information and resources.  
- Improve the phone experience for Survivors.  
- Update administration websites to effectively communicate benefits for Survivors.  
- Simplify and automate the claims forms while communicating the movements of applications through the approval process. 

Meeting the Unique Needs of Children Survivors  
Children introduce additional complexity to the administration of Survivor benefits, given factors such as dependency status, age-related milestones, and time constraints on benefits.  
	Opportunities

- Connect and educate Surviving children over time to ensure delivery of Survivor benefits.  
- Provide reminders to guardians of Surviving children about Survivor benefits.  
- Support the emotional wellbeing of Surviving children with tailored age-appropriate grief counseling.  
- Connect untethered children with VA benefits. 

NCA Funeral Home Engagement Discovery Project: Final Presentation (\*)  
**Date:** September 2023  
**Conducted by:** Veteran Experience Office (VEO) and National Cemetery Administration (NCA)  
**[Link](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/doc/5dca6d3b-4bff-41f8-a789-16d36c5af5ae)**  
**Summary:** “The Veterans Experience Office (VEO), in collaboration with the National Cemetery Administration (NCA), captured the current experience of end-of-life partners (funeral directors and staff) to understand how information about NCA benefits is shared and accessed.   
Our goal was to better understand the role of end-of-life partners and how they can build awareness for eligible Veterans as well as increased awareness and usage of VA memorial benefits and services by helping develop opportunities for engagement and outreach to families through funeral directors and staff.”  
**Relevant Findings:** 

- Insight 2.1: Many funeral homes feel NCA is doing fine, but there is always room for improvement.   
  - Funeral homes desire more automation/digitization of the VA forms and paperwork A few Funeral homes have regular communications with NCA, but those communications are usually cemetery-related announcements   
  - Funeral homes expressed wanting specific tools and resources such as a nice brochure, one-pager, or something written with explanation of benefits and photos of offerings to give families  
- This report contained suggestions focused on the NCA and end-of-life partners. My understanding is the PBB team’s focus will be on the Survivors and updating the VA Form 21P-530EZ so I did not include these suggestions.

Pre-Need **Integration** Application (VA Form 40-10007)  
**Date:** August 2023  
**Conducted by:** Memorials Benefits System (MBS) Self Service Team  
**[Link](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/7bf18f186dd5813e0ca3cfe41ca7c39c7616b476/products/burials-memorials/pre-need/research/integration-research-aug23/Pre-Need%20Integration%20Study%20Readout%20-%20August%202023%20Updated.pdf)**  
**Summary:** The goals of this usability study were to assess user reactions to enhancements necessary for Pre-Need integration with MBMS specifically to:

- Learn how users experience applying for pre-need as it relates to the addition of new fields for Integration and determine what's working well and if pain points exist.  
  - Determine if flow enhancements to the grouping of pages mitigate user confusion with the entering of their details.  
  - Assess additional integration enhancements for content, IA, accessibility, and design to determine what's working well and what isn’t.

**Relevant Findings:**   
Key Findings

1. All participants understood the new fields and options required for integration.  
2. All participants easily navigated adjustments to the flow of pages.  
3. Most participants found the Pre-Need Integration application process to be self-explanatory and straightforward.  
4. All participants quickly determined who they were applying for when going through their specific scenarios.  
5. Most participants understood the various roles in the application, although a few had challenges with the terminology.  
6. While many participants would be able to upload supporting files through mobile, others would have challenges.  
7. All participants expressed confidence in picking a desired VA national cemetery for burial or in knowing where to look for one.

Secondary Findings

1. Most participants found the eligibility and application process guidance on the Pre-Need Information and Form Introduction pages to be valuable as they prepared to start applying.  
2. While nearly all applicants would be able to provide military history details for themselves or for a sponsor, some participants suggested providing additional guidance for where to find service period details (e.g. the DD214).  
3. The VA Claim Number field still poses challenges to participants due to the lack of context.  
4. Users have varying expectations for VA decision times on their claim (one week to several months).  
5. A few participants recommended having more concrete VA decision timelines listed as they found guidance on the After You Apply page to be insufficient.

Recommendations

1. Continue to assess the pre-need application process for improvements.  
2. Consider if more context is needed for "Other comment" text area for race categories field when selecting "Other”.  
3. Optimize the sponsor flow to ensure users aren't seeing pages they don't need to if they indicate the sponsor passed away.  
4. Assess sponsor pages to see if there are additional opportunities for improving user understanding for lengthier application flows.  
5. Explore copy improvements for the "Relationship to service member or Veteran" field to ensure user understanding regardless of if applying for self or someone else.  
6. Include additional context for whose details are needed for applicant details.  
7. Allow users to upload additional file formats such as PNG and JPEG.  
8. Include the ability to upload directly by taking a photo with your camera on the spot.  
9. Provide guidance for VA Claim Number field.

Future Enhancements

1. Determine possibilities for providing additional information regarding Corey Shea Act on VA.gov  
2. Research possibilities for adding a checkbox to certain address pages to easily fill in with previously provided details for users living in the same household.  
3. Explore including guidance on estimated decision times on Confirmation page as well as refining guidance on form Introduction page, Pre-Need Information page, and the After You Apply page.  
   

Pre-Need **Pre-Integration** Application (VA Form 40-10007)  
**Date:** June 2023  
**Conducted by:** Memorials Benefits System (MBS) Self Service Team  
**[Link](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/7bf18f186dd5813e0ca3cfe41ca7c39c7616b476/products/burials-memorials/pre-need/research/pre-integration-research-may23/Pre-Need%20Pre-Integration%20Study%20Readout%20-%20June%202023%20\(1\).pdf)**  
**Summary:**  
The goals of this usability study were to assess user reactions to content, IA, and accessibility enhancements for pre-integration, in addition to:

- Learn how users experience applying for pre-need to identify improvements that can be made to address usability pain points, address user feedback/concerns, improve the rate of mobile applications, and improve submission rates  
- Understand if the pre-need application is confusing for users in the entering of their details, as information is collected for up to four people in the form (applicant, sponsor, preparer, previous decedents), and determine which enhancements could mitigate confusion and reduce form entry errors  
- Determine how potentially sensitive content presented to users in the form can be improved to reduce or eliminate any discomfort users may experience when applying

**Relevant Findings:**  
Key Findings

1. Generally, participants found applying simple and straightforward  
2. Most participants understood who they were applying for  
3. The majority of participants understood the various roles within their application flow  
4. While most participants would be able to upload supporting documents in PDF format through mobile, some recommended additional file formats be accepted  
5. Overall, most participants didn't express concerns with being asked potentially sensitive questions, but some felt strongly about having to provide those details  
6. When having to select a desired cemetery for burial, several participants expressed not knowing which to pick  
7. Participants were generally able to provide applicant or sponsor military details

Secondary Findings

1. Participants generally ranged in expectations for VA responsiveness on their decision for eligibility, with estimates ranging from weeks/one month to over a year  
2. Participant's prior knowledge of Pre-Need was evenly split, with half knowing about it and half not being aware they could apply for burial at a VA national cemetery  
3. Participant estimates for eligibility requirements varied greatly, with some guessing a service-connected disability would render them eligible while others thought honorable service would  
4. The majority of participants expressed interest in applying for Pre-Need  
5. Participants mostly took the time to read the Pre-Need Information (static) page, with several wondering about requirements for Arlington National Cemetery, and one noting there was a lot to read on this page, while a few had trouble locating “Apply” button  
6. Overall, content in the form, such as for documents needed, is targeted to Veterans, not as much to service members even though they are mentioned throughout

Recommendations

1. Continue to assess the Pre-Need user flows for improvements and potentially explore grouping all content from related sections together (Applicant, Sponsor, Preparer) in consecutive order  
2. Determine if any optional questions can be eliminated from the application, especially since additional questions will likely be added for Integration  
3. Assess field label possibilities for "Relationship to Service Member or Veteran" question when applying for self vs. applying for someone else  
4. Assess language for preparers to clearly communicate who they can sign for when completing an application on behalf of someone else  
5. Provide a link to national cemeteries near the desired cemetery field to aid participants in finding a cemetery  
6. Clarify note regarding assignments to other national cemeteries if space is unavailable at the applicant's desired cemetery for burial  
7. Clarify “VA claim number” field so users understand what to provide

Future Enhancements

1. Explore feasibility of adding a checkbox to Sponsor Contact Details for users to indicate if address is the same as Applicant’s for Integration MVP  
2. Improve clarity for preparer question to ensure applicants have no difficulty determining correct choices when applying for themselves or on behalf of someone else  
3. Assess if guidance is needed on Review Application page, particularly for applicants in the upper age brackets as this would require modifying the VA.gov standard pattern  
4. Assess possibilities for capturing additional, more diverse options for demographics questions for Integration form  
5. While we can currently only accept the upload of PDF documents due to EAOS legacy system limitations, explore incorporating additional file formats such as image files, for Integration, along with possibilities for using phone camera for image captures when uploading with VA.gov Platform Team  
6. Discuss the feasibility of prefilling service data from DD214 with VA.gov Platform Team

Next Steps

- Update the Pre-Need Pre-Integration prototype to incorporate agreed-upon recommendations  
- Share findings with stakeholders and other teams working on VA.gov   
- Incorporate learnings into Integration MVP prototype  
- Conduct usability study for Integration MVP solution

**Summary:** In a continuation of research kicked off in April, the Forms Library team developed two new Review Page designs and tested their usability in a second round of research. The findings from this research will help the team better understand Veteran needs and expectations around the Review Page. The Review Page pattern that best suits Veteran needs will be chosen to build in an upcoming iteration of the new VA Forms System Core (VAFSC) package.   
Our goals were to understand: 

- How Veterans use the Review Page in the forms experience by using the Application for Burial Benefits form Review Page (21P-530) as an example.   
- Pain points and accessibility issues on the Review Page of the Application for Burial Benefits form experience.   
- How Veterans interact with the Review Page components in order to determine which of the design variations best suit their needs and has the best usability.

**Relevant Findings:** No relevant information

**Conducted by:** Forms Library Team   
**[Link](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/doc/b711efa8-5655-4c90-9434-eaac2bbfbd1c)**  
**Summary:** As a part of the FLT effort, we interviewed Veterans to understand their experience working with the current Review Page. In addition, we presented three proposed variations to identify which design best suits Veteran needs for reviewing and editing prior to form submission. Based on Veteran feedback, a Review page pattern will be chosen to implement as part of the Q2 Working Demo.   
Goals: 

- Understand how Veterans use the Review Page in the forms experience by using the Application for Burial Benefits form (21P-530) Review Page as an example   
- Identify the best Review page design variation that helps Veterans accomplish their goal VA U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs

**Relevant Findings:**   
Secondary Findings

1. All participants were unsure if their family would have access to their military history information that is required to fill out the burial benefits form.   
2. 3 out of the 6 participants expected for certain sections of the burial benefits form to be auto-filled based on Social Security Number or with the help of VA assistance.

**Relevant Findings:**   
KEY CHALLENGES IN OUTREACH FOR SURVIVOR BENEFITS   
2\) Engaging VA doesn't feel right for some Veterans and survivors 

- Locations aren’t relatable for older Veterans or families  
- Receiving incorrect information  
- Lack of trust in VA

4\) Reaching populations that are isolated from the military and VA 

- Survivors and Veterans can’t afford to travel to conferences and events  
- The elderly may not use digital technology  
- Located in rural areas that are not near VA facilities   
- There is a lack of initial awareness that Survivor benefits even exist  
- Forget benefits exist without continuous reminders or an immediate need

5\) Survivors are confused and overwhelmed, especially without their Veteran around 

- Families aren’t sure what to ask for  
- Language and cultural barriers  
- Survivors can’t fill out forms on their own (need their Veteran or direct guidance)

      Survivor Journey Map (Detailed) (part of Survivors Experience Research Findings Report) (\*)  
      **Date:** 2019  
      **Conducted by:** Veterans Experience Office (VEO) and the Office of Survivors Assistance (OSA)  
      **[Link](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/doc/9cc82785-c57f-480b-bd9a-24525e49696a)**  
      **Summary:** This journey map represents a common set of moments Survivors’ experience after the passing of their Service Member or Veteran. Key “Moments that Matter” emerged by identifying bright spots and challenges from the Survivor’s perspective, which are likely to have a significant impact on the overall experience in interactions with the VA. Additionally, the emotional journey of a Survivor has been illustrated below (purple wave) to provide a deeper insight into the intensity of emotions during the Survivor journey. The taxonomy of emotions listed in the map were developed through the pre-discovery and discovery phases and are not specifically linked to a particular moment, but are meant to provide an overall insight into the emotional journey of a Survivor. While each Survivor’s emotional journey is unique and nuanced, an overall map has been identified to help understand what a Survivor may go through.  
      **Relevant Findings:**  
      Becomes aware of survivor benefits   
      Benefits are available to some Survivors, but they must first become aware of those benefits, whether that is through word of mouth or individual research.  
      A Survivor's experience is influenced by how well they are informed by and connected to the VA and/or Survivor community. Many Survivors hear about benefits available to them through other Survivors or VSOS. However, those who are isolated from these communities might miss out on their eligible benefits.  
        
      Pursues and applies for survivor benefits   
      Based on individual needs, Survivors can apply for various benefits. They may also apply for benefits further down the road if their situation changes. This is often accomplished with the assistance of a Survivor advocate, as the paperwork can be confusing and overwhelming.  
      The paperwork required to apply for benefits feels confusing and overwhelming for many (VSOs and Survivors), especially for those in a state of grief. To assist with this process, a dedicated and informed advocate would greatly improve the Survivor experience and lessen the stress and anxiety of applying for benefits.   
        
      Waits on claims decision   
      Survivors are often concerned about the time it takes their claims to be completed. Veteran's benefits are terminated when they pass away, which may lead to limited income for the survivors. Considering the income changes as well as new financial responsibilities, survivors anxiously await the results of any pending claims for survivor's benefits.  
      Easy and efficient processes to quickly get a claim through VBA are essential in maintaining a Survivor's trust. In addition, a personal connection with VA employees aids in creating a positive experience for Survivors.  
        
      Claims approved/denied   
      Once a decision about the claims application is made, the Survivor receives a decision letter informing them of the outcome. If approved, the Survivor can begin to utilize the benefit.  
      Survivors value speed and efficiency when it comes to processing claims, but crave the affirmation that a human will ask questions about discrepancies when assessing their claim.  
        
        
      Survivor Journey Map (High-level) (part of Survivors Experience Research Findings Report) (\*)  
      **Date:** August 2019  
      **Conducted by:** Veterans Experience Office (VEO) and the Office of Survivors Assistance (OSA)  
      **[Link](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/doc/6d7f8b82-71d5-4765-8975-9eb193620c8b)**  
      **Summary:** “This Journey Map highlights nine ‘life stages’ Survivors may encounter, from preparing with their Veteran to the end of their own life. The ‘moments that matter’ that are aligned to the life stages are experiences Survivors have that stand out to them and others. Similar to Veterans, not all Survivors are the same but there are a broad set of shared moments many Survivors will encounter. Different Survivor personas based on cause of death, relationship, and life experience will all alter the way a Survivor experiences and navigates these moments in their own varied and disparate ways. Using this journey as a guide to organize and align around, VA can plan for and design better experiences for our Veteran’s Survivors.”  
      **Relevant Findings:**  
      \-The map breaks the journey down into four phases: Preparing, Moments Directly After Death, Applying for and Utilizing Benefits, The New Normal  
      \- I believe that our work will be most relevant to the “Moments Directly After Death” and “Applying for and Utilizing Benefits” phases.  
      \- The life stages in these phases are: Memorializing, Informing, and Applying. There are no Moments that Matter for the Memorializing Phase but several Moments that Matter in the Informing and Applying stages that may be relevant to our work.  
      	\- Informing  
      		\- Finds support  
      			\- **Relevant VA connections:** Counseling, VSOs

      \- **Moment that Matters:** Making connections and building relationships with individuals who share in the same grief or loss allows Survivors to better navigate the emotional journey they are experiencing due to the death of their Service Member. The grief never goes away but, through a shared experience it becomes easier to cope and manage life. 

      \- Becomes aware of benefits

      \- **Relevant VA connections:** DIC, CHAMPVA, Home Loans, Education, Burial Benefits

      \- **Moment that Matters:** Being informed and connected is a key influence in the overall experience of a Survivor. While many hear about benefits available to them through other Survivors or VSOs, those who are isolated from such communities might miss out on the opportunities to engage with benefits owed to them.

      \- Applying  
      	\- Claim is approved or denied 

      \- **Moment that Matters:** Survivors value speed and efficiency when their claims are processed, but they also seek affirmation that a real person is looking at the whole picture when assessing their claim.

      \- Waits for decision 

      \- **Moment that Matters:** Easy and efficient processes are essential to maintain a Survivor's trust. In addition, a personal connection with VA employees can build positive experiences for Survivors. 

      \- Pursues and applies for benefits 

      \- **Moment that Matters:** The paperwork required to apply for benefits is confusing and overwhelming for Survivors, especially those in a state of grief. A dedicated and informed advocate would greatly improve the Survivor experience and lessen the stress and anxiety of applying for benefits.
