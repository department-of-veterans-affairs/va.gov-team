# Research Plan for [Non-disability, Burial Benefits form (VA Form 21P-530EZ, 09,2024]

## Background
VA Form 21P-530 (Application for Burial Benefits) enables eligible individuals to apply for compensation to help cover burial, funeral, and transportation costs. Our team launched a new version of the form in May 2024, so it’s now in parity with the paper form. 
Our team is ready to start our research efforts on the Burial Benefits form. We know this form is “often the first time a Veteran’s family interacts directly with VA is during a high-emotional time of a Veteran’s death.” We want to be intentional in approaching research with this form. Therefore, our team decided to conduct research by proxy and speak with VSOs and VSRs first. We will also work with our trauma-informed practice and experts, Rachael Dietkus and Martha Wilkes.
For this research study, we’d like to better understand VSOs' and claimants’ mental models of the Burial Benefits form (by proxy), what provides clarity, and what creates blockers, such as dropoff and delays in the application process.

     - Key Result 2: Our platforms measure and improve the satisfaction of their internal users.

### Veteran Journey
Dying: Scheduling and planning a funeral service
“Often the first time a Veteran’s family interacts directly with VA is during a high-emotional time of a Veteran’s death.”

## Research Goals	
Our goals for this study are the following:
- Understand how VSOs support claimants
- Understand VSOs’ experiences working with claimants and the claimant’s experience by proxy
- Understand what impedes claimants from continuing the Burial benefits form


### Outcome
The study could show that claimants who receive support from VSOs have greater confidence, higher satisfaction, and less application processing time. 

### Research questions
- Understand how VSOs support claimants
     - What brings claimants to seek VSO support?
     - What areas of the application VSOs may need to clarify?
     - What tools do they use to help claimants apply for Burial benefits?
- How can VSOs assist in getting the deceased Veteran’s information and supporting documents?
     - What are the typical causes for issuing development letters when working on the Burial Benefits application?
          - Understand VSOs’ experiences working with claimants and the claimant’s experience by proxy.
          - Understand the claimant by proxy
     - Is it typically family members, friends, caretakers, etc.?
     - What are the claimant’s environment, factors, behaviors, and feelings about the Burial benefits from by proxy through VSOs?
     - What is the VSOs’ mental model of Burial, the Burial application,  Burial service, behaviors, and sentiments?
     - How do VSOs explain required questions or documents, and how do they think about them?
     - What tools do they use to help claimants apply? (VA.gov, other tools?)
     - Why do they prefer the tools they use? What are the pros and cons of various tools?
     - How do they verify that the claimant is a relative, friend, etc., of the deceased Veteran?
- Understand what impedes claimants from continuing the Burial benefits form
     - What may stop someone from applying for the burial benefits form online or on paper?
     - Why do claimants not complete and successfully submit the Burial benefits form?
     - What sections of the application do claimants need more assistance with?
     - What information is most critical?
     - Why might an application be delayed or denied?
 

### Hypothesis
VSOs assisting claimants with the Burial Benefits application will lead to a higher success rate and quicker processing times than claimants relying solely on the information provided in the paper or online form. Those claimants will also have a higher level of satisfaction in the process.

## Methodology	
Moderated session: Conduct 1-on-1 interviews with 3-5 VSOs who have previously participated in the VSO Pension research, assisting claimants with the Burial Benefits form. This is a follow-up research study.  

### Location
Remote Teams meeting

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
VSOs that have experience with the Burial benefits application and have helped process the claim.  We’ll be talking specifically to VSOs who have previously participated in the VSO Pension study. 

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.
