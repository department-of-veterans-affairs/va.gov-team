## Intro - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today and again for participating in the Burial Benefits research study and letting us follow up with you. I’m [name], and I’ll be leading this session today. 

We represent the VA’s Chief Technology Office (OCTO) and are working with the Veterans Business Administration (VBA) to improve the application process for Burial benefits.

Thank you for agreeing to participate!
Today, we’ll discuss how you help Veterans and non-veterans (Veterans' family members and friends) with the Burial benefits form. 
Before we start, I have a few things I want to go over:
This session will take 60 minutes. I do not want to keep you longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the following question or topic.

In this session, we would like to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers. This is not a test, and we simply want to learn about your experience helping Veteran’s families and friends with the Burial Benefits form. We welcome any suggestions and feedback and won’t be offended by any feedback you express.
Your participation in this interview is entirely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don’t want to. If you’d like to stop the session at any time or do not want to answer a question for any reason, it is not a problem. 
We also want to acknowledge the sensitivity and complex subject of this form. We know helping families during a high emotional time can be incredibly difficult. And we’re intentionally using trauma-informed practice for this study.  
I have other colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Would you be okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?

[Observers go on camera, briefly introduce themselves, and then turn off their cameras.] 

Before we get started, do you have any questions?

Can I record this session today? We use the recordings for research purposes only to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we finish analyzing the recordings, they are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

[Start recording]

I have started recording and want to confirm: Are you OK with recording this session?

## Warm-up questions
Before discussing how you help Veterans and non-veterans (Veterans' family members and friends) with the Burial benefits form, I would like to learn more about your experience as an accredited representative. 

- How many claimants do you help with the Burial benefits form in a given year?
- How do you describe the Burial benefit to your clients?

## Applying for Burial benefits
### VSO, Claimant (client), Veteran Relationship
- Who are the typical claimants applying to the Burial Benefits form?
- Are they mostly family members (surviving spouse/partner, child, parent) or friends?
- Do you work with executors and caretakers unrelated to the Veteran? If yes, how so?
- Do you work with funeral homes? If yes, how so?
- How would you describe the needs of each different type of claimant?
- What is the degree of closeness these claimants have with the deceased veterans?
- How do you verify that the claimant is a relative, friend, or any relationship in which they say they are of the deceased Veteran?

   - Had they tried filling out the paper or the online form before they came for your support?
   - What do you think is their understanding of the different benefits of the form?
   - Do they understand the difference between burial allowance (service-connected, non-service-connected), plot or interment allowance, and transportation allowance?

## Conclusion
- Is there anything else about the claimant’s experience applying for Burial Benefits that you think would be important to know?
- What would you change if you had a magic wand and could make any changes to the Burial benefits form or the process of helping claimants receive this benefit? 
     - Why?  [If not apparent] How might that help claimants?

- As a final question, would you be open to participating in future research sessions like this one?
- We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback and perspective are so helpful to us as we continue to improve the experience of applying for Burial benefits.
