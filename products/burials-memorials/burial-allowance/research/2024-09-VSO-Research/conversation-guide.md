## Intro - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today and again for participating in the Burial Benefits research study and letting us follow up with you. I’m [name], and I’ll be leading this session today. 

We represent the VA’s Chief Technology Office (OCTO) and are working with the Veterans Business Administration (VBA) to improve the application process for Burial benefits.

Thank you for agreeing to participate!
Today, we’ll discuss how you help Veterans and non-veterans (Veterans' family members and friends) with the Burial benefits form. 
Before we start, I have a few things I want to go over:
This session will take 60 minutes. I do not want to keep you longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the following question or topic.

In this session, we would like to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers. This is not a test, and we simply want to learn about your experience helping Veteran’s families and friends with the Burial Benefits form. We welcome any suggestions and feedback and won’t be offended by any feedback you express.
Your participation in this interview is entirely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don’t want to. If you’d like to stop the session at any time or do not want to answer a question for any reason, it is not a problem. 
We also want to acknowledge the sensitivity and complex subject of this form. We know helping families during a high emotional time can be incredibly difficult. And we’re intentionally using trauma-informed practice for this study.  
I have other colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Would you be okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?

[Observers go on camera, briefly introduce themselves, and then turn off their cameras.] 

Before we get started, do you have any questions?

Can I record this session today? We use the recordings for research purposes only to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we finish analyzing the recordings, they are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

[Start recording]

I have started recording and want to confirm: Are you OK with recording this session?

## Warm-up questions
Before discussing how you help Veterans and non-veterans (Veterans' family members and friends) with the Burial benefits form, I would like to learn more about your experience as an accredited representative. 

- How many claimants do you help with the Burial benefits form in a given year?
- How do you describe the Burial benefit to your clients?

## Applying for Burial benefits
### VSO, Claimant (client), Veteran Relationship
