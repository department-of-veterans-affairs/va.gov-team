# Release Plan: 2024 21P-53-EZ Online Form Updates

Goal: **How might we craft a release plan to test our product "in the wild" at a smaller scale, and learn how Veterans will actually use it, and what problems it actually might have or create, and then fix/adjust before going live to millions of VA.gov users?**

## How to use this release plan

1. Create a release plan using this template in your feature documentation. Optionally, remove the extra text from the template.
2. Fill out all the details below.
3. Review the release plan with the team and your OCTO before [releasing your app to production](#step-3-production-rollout).

## Release Plan Overview

If no staged rollout:
| Phase | Duration | Users | Dates |
|---|---|---|---|
|Phase 1: Unmoderated production testing |2 days|TBD| TBD|
|Phase 2: 100% of users |indefinite|100% of users (auth and non-auth)|TBD|

If a staged rollout (may not be possible):

| Phase | Duration | Users | Dates |
|---|---|---|---|
|Phase 1: Unmoderated production testing |2 days|TBD| TBD  |
|Phase 2A: 25% of users |2 days|25% of users (auth and non-auth)|TBD|
|Phase 2B: 50% of users |2 days|50% of users (auth and non-auth)|TBD|
|Phase 2C: 100% of users| indefinite | 100% users (auth and non-auth) | TBD |


## Overview
As outlined in the [intiative brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/burials-memorials/burial-allowance/530-initiative-brief-2024-updates.md), the online 21P-530EZ for is out of alignment with the most recent version (or several versions) of the paper form. The updates associated with this release will add missing fields to the online form, remove depreciated fields, update form components, and address critical accessibility issues within the pages that are getting updated. Updates to the static pages that lead into the form flow may also be needed.

### The release plan will need to consider the following use cases:
1. All Users
      - Users will see an alert on the form information page letting them know that the form will be undergoing updates and that they should log in before starting to save their work or wait to fill out the application until a specific date when the updates will be live.
      - Option: Users with in-progress applications will see a warning on each page letting them know the form will be updated on a specific date, so they need to submit their application prior to that date or they may need to either fill out additional information (if authenticated) or lose their data (if unauthenticated)
2. Users with in-progress forms
   - Authenticated:
      - Users actively filling out the form can proceed with their applications, but they will see an error message when they try to submit. **Can we customize the error message to explain what happened and what action they need to take?** They will need to navigate back to the information page where they will see an alert box will appear letting them know there are new questions that need to be answered and/or that they may need to provide additional information on previously answered questions. **Will they be logged out and need to log back in?**
      - Users who are not actively working on their application will be taken to the start of the form the next time they log in to continue their application. They will see the same alert notifying them of the form changes.
   - Unauthenticated
      - Remove the option to fill out the form unauthenticated for a specific period of time leading up to the release of the form updates to prevent users from losing in-progress information. An alert on the information page would explain that the form is undergoing changes and will be available on xx date.
         - Suggest removing the authenticated option 1-2 days before release given that most users complete the form in one session (average 23 minutes), however, there may still be unauthenticated users who are caught with in-progress forms when the updates are released, and they will lose their data.
         - Display an alert warning on each form page 5-days before release letting unauthenticated users with in-progress applications know that they need to submit their applications by xx date or they will lose thei form data and need to start over with the updated application. 
3. Users with no in-progress forms
   - Users will see an alert on the form information page letting them know that the form will be undergoing updates and that they should log in before starting to save their work or wait to fill out the application until a specific date when the updates will be live.
 

### This release will include the following components:
1. Form field updates on some pages (add new fields, remove old fields)
2. Form component updates on the pages already receiving form field updates
3. Accessibility updates on the pages already receiving form field updates
4. Pre-release info alert on the form information page xx days before release notifying users that the form will be updated on xx date and it will be temporarily unavailable from xx to xx for unauthenticated users. Suggest removing the unauthenticated option 1-2 days before release. This needs to be closely coordinated with CAIA (Aliyah Blackmore and Lily Strelich.)
5. Pre-release warning alert on each form page that appears 5 days before release notifying users with in-progress forms that the form will be updated on xx date, so they need to submit their application prior to that date or they may need to either fill out additional information (if authenticated) or lose their data (if unauthenticated). This needs to be closely coordinated with CAIA (Aliyah Blackmore and Lily Strelich.)
7. Post-release info alert on form introduction page that notifies authenticated users that the form has been updated and contins new fields. This needs to be closely coordinated with CAIA (Aliyah Blackmore and Lily Strelich).

## Step 1: Development

You'll need to create a feature toggle (or two) for any moderately or significantly changing feature. Follow the [best practices for creating feature toggles](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/feature-toggles).

List the features toggles here.

| Toggle name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [FILL_IN] | [FILL_IN] |

## Step 2: Validation

Since we use a [continuous delivery](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/deployment-process) model, once code is in the `main` branch, it will be deployed that day. 

Before enabling your feature toggle in production, you'll need to:

- [ ] Follow [best practices for QA](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/qa-and-accessibility-testing).
- [ ] Have your team perform as much validation in staging as possible. Validation may be challenging for some teams and systems due to downstream requirements, but the staging system should mimic the production system as much as possible.
- [ ] Work any downstream or dependant systems proactively to ensure that the feature is ready for use once it hits production.
- [ ] Have a go/no go meeting with the team to ensure that the feature is ready for use and signed off by each discipline and your DEPO/OCTO contact. During this meeting, you'll need to:
  - [ ] review the plan with your DEPO/OCTO representative.
  - [ ] review the release plan with your team.

## Step 3: Production rollout

### Do I need a staged rollout?

**Yes**, a staged rollout is required unless you can confidently answer "yes" to all of the following:

- This change does not add substantial new functionality to VA.gov
- This change does not impact user flows through tasks
- This change does not affect traffic to backend services

*Example*: a change to a page's text content **could skip** staged rollout

*Example*: a minor visual redesign to a page that doesn't affect user flows **could skip** staged rollout

*Example*: adding a new field to an existing form **could skip** staged rollout

*Example*: a new feature on an existing application that creates new backend traffic **needs staged rollout**

*Example*: a significant change to how users navigate an existing form **needs staged rollout**

*Example*: a feature that will route significantly more users (and therefore more backend traffic) to an existing application **needs staged rollout**

#### Exceptions

Currently, [feature toggles](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/platform/tools/feature-toggles/) are the primary tool VSP provides for facilitating staged rollout. If feature toggles don't work for your use case, you can request an exception from staged rollout in Staging Review.

| Feature type | Possible with feature toggles? |
| --- | --- |
| New feature in existing application | Yes |
| New application | Yes |
| Static content changes | Doable but tricky |
| URL redirects | No |

DEPO VSP / OCTO leads can approve other exceptions to this requirement.

### Define the Rollback process

Even though your feature has been tested and ready, production is still a different environment than staging. You'll need to create a rollback plan if things go wrong. Usually, this is as simple as a feature toggle flip. Be as specific as possible.

> Example
>
> - Our PM and PO will monitor analytics. If they see a spike in errors or unexpected behavior, they will contact the engineering team to get the FE engineer to disable the toggle.

[FILL_IN]: create your rollback plan

### Phase I: moderated production testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)

#### Planning

- Desired date range or test duration: [FILL_IN]
- Desired number of users: [FILL_IN]
- How you'll recruit the right production test users: [FILL_IN]
- How you'll conduct the testing: [FILL_IN]
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: [FILL_IN]

#### Results

- Number of users: [FILL_IN]
- Number of bugs identified / fixed: [FILL_IN]/[FILL_IN]

### Phase II: Staged Rollout (also known as unmoderated production testing)

We recommend that the rollout plan has five stages, each increasing the number of Veterans. This plan is a strongly recommended guideline but should only be deviated for precise reasons.

#### Rollout Planning

- How will you make the product available in production while limiting the number of users who can find/access it: [FILL_IN].
- What metrics-based criteria will you look at before advancing rollout to the next stage ("success criteria")?: \[use your KPIs to help guide this. It could be things like *abandonment rate < 20%*, *reported contact center calls < 2 calls*, *error rate < 5%*, etc.\]
  - [FILL_IN] : list
  - [FILL_IN] : of
  - [FILL_IN] : KPIs
- Links to the dashboard(s) showing "success criteria" metrics: [FILL_IN] with link to dashboards (example: Google Analytics dashboard)
- Who is monitoring the dashboard(s)?: [FILL_IN]

## Post-launch Questions

*To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above.*

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders?
1. Which assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated?
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
1. What technical tasks are needed to clean up (i.e., removal of feature toggles)?
