Section errors that get triggered due to adding additional benefits stay persistent, even after removing those benefits, blocking claimants from submitting the form

#### Steps to replicate

- Get to the Review page
- Expand the "Benefits selection" section
- Select either Burial allowance or Plot allowance and click "Update page"

## ~Issue 4~ 
When updating the "Date of death" and "Date of burial" of the deceased Veteran, the claimant does not get informed if these dates are more than 2 years from our current date.

#### Steps to replicate
- On step 2, enter any day in 2023 for the "Date of death" and "Date of burial" of the deceased Veteran
- Get to the review page
- Expand the "Veteran information"
- Change the year to 2019 or less
- No warning note gets triggered here as it does in Step 2

#### Possible Solution
Based on the feedback we got during our midpoint review, we will remove this alert and add it as additional instructions to this page.


## Issue 5
<img width="20%" align="right" alt="image" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/91498500/80d7d2ed-6daf-4c9c-ba5d-ce585173b011">
A claimant can add multiple blank previous names the deceased Veteran served under without having to enter a name first. This behavior is different than the same section in Step 3. On Step 3 you are not allowed to add additional names unless you add a name first.

#### Steps to replicate
- On step 2, get to the "Previous name" section, and select "No" to the "Did the Veteran serve under another name?" question
- Get to the Review page
- Expand the "Military history" section
- Click "Edit" on the "Previous name" section, and select "Yes" to the "Did the Veteran serve under another name?" question
- Click "Add another name" multiple times
As mentioned in Issue 1, the claimant is allowed to submit this application with multiple empty previous names

#### Possible Solution
1) Once "Yes" is selected for the "Did the Veteran serve under another name?" question and new fields appear, delete the "Add another name" until "Update" has been clicked. Designs for this solution: [Editable](https://www.sketch.com/s/de782a35-e147-4c32-a2a8-ba53071ec8e7/a/mP0x9bg) | [Updated/Saved](https://www.sketch.com/s/de782a35-e147-4c32-a2a8-ba53071ec8e7/a/j4D2yVW) OR
2) Once "Add another name" is clicked, trigger inline errors

<br><br>

## Issue 6
The claimant does not know what additional actions should be taken to resolve errors triggered

#### Steps to replicate example 1
- On step 4, only select "Transportation" as a benefit
- Get to the Review page
- Expand the "Benefits selection" section
- Select either Burial allowance or Plot allowance and click "Update page"
This triggers errors on a new section that appears. The claimant is not informed that they need to add all required information

#### Possible Solution
1) Adding content to let the claimant know there is additional required information that needs to be entered, and highlighting the blank sections with missing information. [Designs for this solution](https://www.sketch.com/s/de782a35-e147-4c32-a2a8-ba53071ec8e7/a/bLZ2xm0)

 
#### Steps to replicate example 2

- Get to the Review page
- Expand the "Benefits selection" section
- Select either Burial allowance or Plot allowance and click "Update page"

- Click "Update page" and then "Submit application"

#### Possible Solution
1) Add more information on the error alert, and list impacted sections as links that when clicked expand the right section.
