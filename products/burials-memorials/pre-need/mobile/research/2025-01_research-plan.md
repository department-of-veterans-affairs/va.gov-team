## Pre-Need Burial: Research Plan

[work in progress]


### Background

Veterans are able to apply to find out if they are eligible to be buried in a VA national cemetery (pre-need burial eligibility). After the claim is filed, they will receive a decision letter regarding their eligibility. This application form (VA Form 40-10007) is currently available within the authenticated section of VA.gov. Decision letters are mailed to the Veteran; there are no digital versions available within their account.

There are currently no mentions of pre-need burial eligibility (information, application form, claim status, decision letters) on the mobile app.

We plan on determining how much of the pre-need burial benefit process to build into the mobile app.

#### __OCTO Priorities__

Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.


#### __Veteran Journey__

Dying



* Deciding how and where to be memorialized

Putting down roots



* Taking care of my family (lifting the weight of them having to arrange burial)


### __Research Goals__



* Understand what prompts Veterans to think about their burial details so that we consider what information to provide to them.
* Understand how Veterans are learning about their burial benefits so we can consider where to provide information to them.
* Test the clarity of pre-need burial information on VA.gov.
* Understand the goals of Veterans for pre-need burial so we can determine what will be useful.


#### __Outcome__



* Determine how and when to surface burial information to Veterans
* Determining what we will be adding to the app for pre-need burial
* (if applicable) determining optimal information architecture for adding pre-need items into the app
* (if applicable) make recommendations for restructuring the pre-need burial section of VA.gov


#### __Research questions__



* How are veterans learning about their burial benefits?
    * What prompts them to consider burial options?
* Do they know about and understand the concept of pre-need?
* How easy is it to find information on pre-need?
    * How well does the pre-need burial documentation on VA.gov convey the necessary information?
    * Is it clear what to expect from the process?
* What are the goals of veterans for pre-need burial?
    * What do they need to accomplish these goals?
    * How are these items most useful?
* How do veterans want to find and access relevant items for pre-need burial within the app?
* How do veterans want to be notified of updates to their pre-need burial claims?


#### __Hypothesis__

Our hypotheses:



* Many Veterans will not have heard of the pre-need burial benefit.
* Filling out the pre-need burial form will be too cumbersome for the app because of the paperwork that needs to be uploaded.
* Veterans will want to see updates of the claim status in the app.
* Veterans will want to have decision letters available within their VA.gov account instead of relying on physical letters to keep track of.


### __Methodology__

Semi-structured interviews over Zoom, from their mobile devices



* Mostly conversation
* Some usability on VA.gov (unauthenticated portion) for gauging comprehension


#### __Research materials__

For moderated interviews:



* [Link to conversation guide](?tab=t.q3282co9rzap)
* Possibly including a prototype?
    * To minimize technical hurdles, having all resources available from as few links as possible would be ideal (especially on mobile, it can be cumbersome for participants to switch between the Zoom chat or email and back to a browser)
    * Link 1: burial benefits info section on VA.gov
    * Link 2: pre-need info section on VA.gov (How do I prepareâ€¦)
    * Link 3: prototype of pre-need application on mobile - ability to tap through each screen so they can see everything that will be required, but not have to fill anything out.
    * Link 4: App home screen, enough to look through the different tabs (preferred to have a prototype instead of using participant's app so we don't have to deal with any potential issues of log-in screens, update notifications, or anything else that may block them from showing us their app)
    * 


#### __Recruitment approach__

Intended audience



* Veterans only, using Perigean to recruit
* Primary requirement
    * 50% Want to be buried in a VA cemetery and have taken steps to plan their burial (i.e. have utilized burial benefits for themselves)
    * 50% Want to be buried in a VA cemetery but have not done any preparation (and ideally are not aware of the pre-need burial benefit)
* No participants with assistive technologies initially, unless we move into usability testing


#### __Recruitment criteria__

Please recruit 15 participants, all Veterans (our aim is to interview 12)

_Note to be included as an introduction to screener questions:_ This research will explore topics related to death and burials. Discussions may include past experiences or considering future plans that you might not have thought about before. Please participate only if you feel comfortable engaging with these sensitive topics.

_	[answering Yes to A would qualify; answering Yes to B would disqualify]_

Primary criteria:

### __Timeline__

Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.


#### __Prepare__

When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.



* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session:


#### __Research sessions__



* February 10 - 21, 2025


#### __Length of sessions__



* 1-hour sessions
* 30 minutes between sessions
* 4 per day


#### __Availability__



* Monday February 10
* Tuesday February 11
* Wednesday February 12
* Thursday February 13
* Friday February 14
* Monday February 17
* Tuesday February 18
* Wednesday February 19
* Thursday February 20
* Friday February 21

When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. _Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S._

Please request enough dates and at _least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants_. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; _12 time slots for 6 participants_). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.


### __Team Roles__

Please do not include email addresses in this section. We previously required email addresses. VA's GitHub policy ([see announcement](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/discussions/13)) has changed. VA.gov email addresses cannot be in public repositories.

Please list the names of people in each role. In the Slack study channel, send an email and primary phone number for the moderator. Send emails only for the notetaker, accessibility specialist, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker.
