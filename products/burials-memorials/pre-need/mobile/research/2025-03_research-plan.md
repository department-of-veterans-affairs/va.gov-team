# Pre-Need Burial: Research Plan


## Background

Veterans are able to apply to find out if they are eligible to be buried in a VA national cemetery (pre-need burial eligibility). After the application is filed, they will receive a decision letter regarding their eligibility. This application form (VA Form 40-10007) is currently available within the authenticated section of VA.gov. Decision letters are mailed to the Veteran; there are no digital versions available within their account.

The VA app currently lacks any features related to pre-need eligibility, such as:



* Information about the benefit
* Access to the application form
* Application tracking
* Digital decision letters

This research aims to evaluate which aspects of the pre-need burial eligibility process should be integrated into the VA mobile app to better serve Veterans' needs.

## OCTO Priorities

Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.


## Veteran Journey

Dying



* Deciding how and where to be memorialized

Putting down roots



* Taking care of my family (lifting the weight of them having to arrange burial)


## Research Goals



* Understand what prompts Veterans to think about their burial details so that we consider what information to provide to them.
* Understand how Veterans are learning about their burial benefits so we can consider where to provide information to them.
* Test the clarity of pre-need burial information on VA.gov.
* Understand the goals of Veterans for pre-need burial so we can determine what will be useful.


## Outcome



* Develop a strategy for proactively surfacing burial information to Veterans
* Define pre-need burial features for the mobile app
* Create information architecture for pre-need features
* Identify opportunities to improve the pre-need burial content on VA.gov


## Research questions

Discovery Journey



* How are veterans learning about their burial benefits?
* What prompts them to consider burial options?
* Do they know about and understand the concept of pre-need?

Current Information Evaluation



* How easy is it to find information on pre-need?
* How well does the pre-need burial documentation on VA.gov convey the necessary information?
* Is it clear what to expect from the process?

User Needs



* What are the goals of veterans for pre-need burial?
* What specific tasks do they need to accomplish?
* How do veterans want to find and access relevant items for pre-need burial?
* How do veterans want to be notified of updates to their pre-need burial application?


## Hypotheses



* Many Veterans will not have heard of the pre-need burial benefit.
* Filling out the pre-need burial form will be too cumbersome for the app because of the paperwork that needs to be uploaded.
* Veterans will want to see updates of the application status in the app.
* Veterans will want to have decision letters available within their VA.gov account instead of relying on physical letters to keep track of.


## Methodology

Semi-structured interviews over Zoom, from their mobile devices



* Mostly conversation
* Some usability on VA.gov (unauthenticated portion) for gauging comprehension


## Research materials



* [Link to conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/burials-memorials/pre-need/mobile/research/2025-03_conversation-guide.md)
* Unauthenticated portion of VA.gov
* [Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/XW0MKGL4iuHHRChVFVD6mF/MFS-Pre-need-burials?page-id=24480%3A20737&node-id=24480-23451&viewport=411%2C-127%2C0.5&t=H8zQMctx3T9NmBSm-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&hotspot-hints=0): [to be viewed on a phone]
    * This will primarily serve as a method to facilitate conversations rather than for usability testing. Many elements have been removed from the design to maintain a high-level discussion.
    * There are three sections in this prototype:
        * Pre-need application (a few screens only) – We plan to pause participants on the upload screen to discuss logistics. The only active buttons are Start, Back, and Continue.
        * MyVA dashboard (simplified) – We will discuss where they might want to find updates after submitting the application.
        * VA app (simplified) – This will involve the same discussion as the dashboard.
    * Navigation between sections will be via new buttons


## Recruitment approach

Intended audience



* Veterans only, using Perigean to recruit
* Primary requirement
    * 50% Want to be buried in a VA cemetery and have taken steps to plan their burial (i.e. have utilized burial benefits for themselves)
    * 50% Want to be buried in a VA cemetery or are undecided, but have not done any preparation (and ideally are not aware of the pre-need burial benefit)
* Initially, there will be no participants using assistive technologies. We will test with these users in a later phase if we conduct usability testing.


## Recruitment criteria

We request a kickoff call with Perigean.
