## Session Conversation


### Intro - 5 minutes

Thank you so much for joining today. My name is Emily, and Natasha here will be taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the digital waiting room who would like to observe, but we’ll get to that momentarily.

Today, we’ll be discussing some aspects of burial and funeral planning. Before we begin, I just want to check—are you comfortable talking about this topic?

Before we start, I have a few logistics to cover:



* This will take about 60 minutes. Because I want to keep us on time, I may occasionally prompt you to the next topic.
* We want your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers, and we’re not testing anything of you. I will not be offended by any opinions you share.
* Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
* I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was all right to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with (1 / 2) of my colleagues observing this session?
    * If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    * If yes: Admit observers.
    * Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. 
    * Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
* I’ll be having you work with a prototype for part of today. It may look and act like the real app and website, but it’s only a demo tool and therefore lots of elements will not be working. You will not be logged into your account, so nothing you do will affect your benefits or anything else in your account.
* If you would be okay with it, we would like to record this session today, but let me explain things first before you consent. 
    * The purpose is to assure that we capture your opinions accurately. Your name and other identifying information will never be used when reporting on this project – for example we assign you a participant ID (such as P7) if quoting you. And after we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed.
    * Knowing this, are you comfortable with me recording the session?
    * And also, it can sometimes be helpful to share video clips from sessions to our VA partners so they can better understand the experiences of Veterans. In these clips, we blur out anything that could identify you – your profile photo for example – and they would only be shared among VA partners. I will also ask at the end of this session so that you could veto, but knowing this, would you be comfortable with us potentially using a clip from this session?
    * [if yes] I’m going to start the recording, and once I do I’m going to confirm once more that you’re okay with the recording.

Start recording.



* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
* Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?


### Discussion

Could you tell me a bit about yourself as a Veteran: what branch of the military did you serve, and when did you retire or separate?

How have you been involved with the VA – both in the past and now?



* Have you been in any of their facilities?
* Have you used the website?

We’re going to be discussing VA benefits as they relate to burials today.



* First, speaking more generally about all benefits you’re entitled to as Veteran:
    * How have you learned about the benefits in the past?
        * have you searched for them or have you been told about them somehow?
    * What resources have you found most helpful?
* Can you tell me what you know about burial benefits available to Veterans?
    * (if none: how might you expect or want to learn about them?)
    * How did you learn about them? 
    * Where have you seen/heard them mentioned?
* Do you have any experience with planning Veteran funerals?
    * (if none: experience with planning anyone’s funeral?)
    * Did you know ahead of time the deceased’s wishes? How had you learned?
* Tell me about any thinking or planning on your own wishes for your burial
    * Do you recall what prompted you to start? 
    * (if none: what might prompt you to start?)
    * Have you told those close to you these wishes? How have you informed them?
    * (any thoughts for how you would want to share those wishes with those close to you?
* We’re going to now discuss a specific benefit to Veterans: the pre-need burial benefit.
    * Are you familiar with it? Can you tell me what you understand about it?
    * (if not familiar) 
        * You apply to find out in advance if you’re eligible to be buried in a VA national cemetery.
        * Where would you expect and want to find that information?
        * When might you want to learn more about it? What might prompt you to explore?
    * (if familiar)
        * Do you recall when and how you learned about this benefit?
* When looking into this benefit, what information would you be looking for?
    * Are there questions you would want answered?


### Usability / Screen sharing

We’re now going to move to some screen sharing



* I’d like you to look at this link I’ll send to you [[burial section](https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/) on VA.gov]. Let’s say you’re looking for information on preparing for your own burial:
    * Looking at this screen, tell me your thought process for exploring options for yourself.
    * What information would you be looking for?
    * What questions would you want answered?
    * How clear is the information presented here?
* Let’s say you decide that you are going to apply; walk me through your thoughts on preparing to do so. [if they haven’t already gone there, guide them to the [pre-need section](https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/pre-need-eligibility/)]
    * How would you want to apply? (online, mail, fax) Why choose that method?
        * If online: would you choose a mobile phone or a desktop computer? Why?
    * Would you ask for help from anyone? What would you want help with?
    * How easy will it be to gather the required information?
        * Is there anything that could make it easier?
* Moving away from burials specifically for a moment, have you filed out any sort of form with VA before? This could be either paper forms or on the computer.
    * If so, what was your experience like after completing it, regarding next steps for your form?
    * Were there things you wished had gone differently?
* Returning to burials, I’m now going to send you another link [[prototype of application on mobile](https://www.figma.com/proto/XW0MKGL4iuHHRChVFVD6mF/MFS-Pre-need-burials?page-id=24480%3A20737&node-id=24480-23451&viewport=411%2C-127%2C0.5&t=H8zQMctx3T9NmBSm-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&hotspot-hints=0)]
    * This is the online application for pre-need burial benefit. It’s a demo, so this is not connected to your account.
        * I won’t have you fill anything out here; this is more to aid our conversation
        * This demo is set up to represent a signed-in account for a person named Sammy
            * Only a few screens are represented here, as the actual application is quite a few pages
            * Everything is filled out on each screen, and the only active buttons are the ‘back’ and ‘continue’ buttons at the bottom of each.
    * Now that you’re seeing the application, please share any additional thoughts on filling it out on your mobile phone.
    * [stop on screen “6 of 7 Supporting files”]
        * How easy do you think it would be to gather the required information?
    * Do you see benefits for filling out the application on your phone?
        * Do you see potential problems with using your phone for this?
* Upon reaching “You’ve submitted your application”
    * We’ll stay on this page for a moment. What are you expecting the next steps will be?
    * What would you want from the VA?
    * How would you want to learn about next steps or status?
        * How important is this to you?
* Now let’s say that the decision has been made on your application.
    * There are two possibilities:
        * You are eligible and approved for burial in a VA cemetery
        * You’re not eligible and are given information on requesting a decision review
    * Talk to me about how you would expect to be notified.
    * What will you want to do with this information? How will you want to access it?
    * Who would you want to have access to this information? How would you want them to access it?
    * After you receive the decision, what sort of support or communication might you want from the VA?
* And now tap “Go to MyVA” at the bottom
    * This is a demo page of your account within the VA website. As you can see, there are only placeholders for each section.
    * Continuing our conversations from the previous page, after you’ve submitted your application but before a decision has been made: is there any place here that you would expect to find updates?
        * Talk to me about why you would look there
        * What exactly would you be looking for?
        * Are there other places you might look?
    * And now after a decision has been made on your application: is there any place here you would expect to find that information?
        * Talk to me about why you would look there
        * What exactly would you be looking for?
        * Are there other places you might look?
        * What will you want to do with this information? How will you want to access it?
        * For anyone you want to have access to this information: how would you want them to access it?
* And now tap “Go to VA App”
    * This is a demo page of the VA mobile app
    * Same questions as we discussed on the previous screen: after you’ve submitted your application but before a decision has been made, is there any place here that you would expect to find updates?
        * Talk to me about why you would look there
        * What exactly would you be looking for?
        * Are there other places you might look?
    * And now after a decision has been made on your application: is there any place here you would expect to find that information?
        * Talk to me about why you would look there
        * What exactly would you be looking for?
        * Are there other places you might look?
        * What will you want to do with this information? How will you want to access it?
        * For anyone you want to have access to this information: how would you want them to access it?

Those are all my questions. I’m going to check in with my team to see if anyone has any questions. If anyone would like to ask anything, you can unmute yourself and ask now.

Is there anything else you would like to share regarding the burial benefits we discussed that you haven’t yet shared?


### Consent to use video clips



* I want to check once again that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners with your identifying information removed.
* Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


### Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the digital experience and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
