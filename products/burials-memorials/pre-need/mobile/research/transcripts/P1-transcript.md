# P1

Moderator: Okay, and so just to have it on the record, I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? 

P1: Yes. 

Moderator: Okay, great. And also to confirm, are you okay if we potentially use clips from this to share with our VA partners? 

P1: Yes. 

Moderator: Thank you very much. All right, now time to the actual discussion. So first, just a little intro, I'd love to hear about you. For you, as a veteran, I'd love to know what branch of the military you served and when you were retired or separated. 

P1: Okay, I spent 25 years in the US Army. I joined in 1981, roughly, and left in 2006. 

Moderator: Okay, great. All right. And what has your been involvement? Or what has? How have you been with involved with the VA, if at all? 

P1: Um, as soon as I got out in 2006, I started using the VA medical facilities. Um, I've used the VA for, um, my education a couple of times.

Most recently, about four years ago, um, when I went blind, I went back to school for another master's in social media. And I've also used the VA, um, because I buried my father in a military cemetery. 

Moderator: Oh, got it. Okay. Great. I will be following up the questions about your father's burial, so that is good to know. All right. So you said you, you you are blind, right?

P1: I'm legally blind. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. 

P1: And I'm service-connected for that, so I also work for the Blinded Veterans Association as [REDACTED]. I work on that side, too, helping other people with the VA. 

Moderator: Oh, that's great. We attended a town hall of theirs about a month ago. That was fun to to meet folks there. 

P1: Oh, you were in that. Okay, I didn't realize that you guys did it. You did it for the usability study. Okay. 

Moderator: Yeah, oh, I was I was just there. So yeah, so Martha, who I know is often involved. Yeah, she she works on on our side, or sounds weird. Within. Yeah, she she helps with with the website and the app or research the app, I forget. But yeah, she had she had invited a number of other researchers and designers to join just to listen and see what everyone was talking about. So, which was really nice. Nice of her to to do. I do so. I was planning on showing you some things. Can you explain a little bit like how?

P1: Yeah, I have peripheral vision. I use my eccentric vision, they call it. So I can read like one letter at a time on my iPhone, I can see that you have longish hair. I don't know blonde, you've got a curtain background. But don't ask me about your eyes. 

Moderator: Well, I think even from my I don't think I can even see my eye color from from how tiny it is. So OK, all right. So we'll see. Yeah. We'll see. Once we start sharing, we'll see how that goes. You know, adjustments as necessary. 

P1: Okay, I'm gonna do that bigger. All right. Yeah, got it. Okay. And I may, one of the reasons why I turned my camera off is because in order to see the screen, I have to be a screen looker and you don't need my thing. Can I turn my camera off now? 

Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that's a very good point. Yeah. So once we do get to the screen sharing aspect, absolutely. We're just going to talk for a little bit. So yeah, no need to come in close for anything. But that is I like that mug. That's a pretty design. Got it. Okay, I got sidetracked here. So how much now? How much now would you say you are active on on the website? Or you've said so much, so much that you do with various parts of the VA. 

P1: I'm the VA, I'm probably on their site at least once a week, either looking things up for other veterans or myself, or doing research for articles or things like that. 

Moderator: Oh, okay, good. Nice. What sort of articles are you like for sorry for?

P1: BVA for the BVA newsletter. You know, I wrote an article about being buried at sea, which isn't part of the cemetery people, but the Navy does it. 

Moderator: Yeah. Oh, okay. Yep. I have not read into that, but I will. So good to know. And do you or have you use the VA app at all? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Great. Do you recall what aspects you use the app? 

P1: Um, the, the MyHealtheVet app kind of thing that app. Yeah. Yeah. I've, I use that. Um, I prefer to actually do it on my desktop. Um, but I have used the app. It's just too small. And if I put it on my desk, I can see the whole screen and figure out what to do. But it's a little bit harder on the phone for me. 

Moderator: Okay, so for size purposes, you prefer to do things on a computer? 

P1: Yes, but I do things on my phone. 

Moderator: Yeah. Okay. Any, anyâ€¦ Oh, sorry, go ahead. 

P1: Oh, because sometimes, you know, you're, you're out of the home, and you have to do things once you are. 

Moderator: So besides being out and about somewhere where you need to be connected, are there other reasons that you do things on your phone as opposed to your computer? 

P1: I'm lazy and I'm sitting in bed or my easy chair or it's a beautiful day outside in Florida and I'm sitting outside 

Moderator: Those are all great reasons, I love it. Okay, so we are going to be discussing the VA benefits as they relate to burials. So first, I know you said like you had been involved with burying your father. How had you learned about any sort of burial benefits, I'm sorry, I'm back up, about any sort of benefits? Do you recall how you originally learned about what is available? 

P1: It was from my family. My, we lost a younger brother. He was like 12 years old. And my father knew that he was, you know, and he said, No, we can bury them in the cemetery in his, you know, in a national cemetery, because he's entitled to a plot. And any minor children that die, you know, at any time, can be buried in his plot. So there were there were two younger brothers buried in the plot before my father and mother got there. 

Moderator: Got it. OK. 

P1: So that's how I knew. 

Moderator: Okay, okay. So family story. Yes, family story. Okay, got it. Any other benefits outside of burials that you might have learned elsewhere, besides from your family. 

P1: I guess, you know, the whole GI Bill, the college benefits, which I knew about, probably from, you know, as a teenager in high school, recruiters coming to talk to you, things like that, about school benefits. And then I'm just a voracious reader.

So I just got onto the website and read everything I, you know, and read everything. Read them all. Okay. Yeah, I found the VA regulation on the old voc rehab, the VRE program, veteran readiness and employment. And before I went blind, I read that whole thing. And I knew exactly what I was entitled to, like going to school at half the rate. If your doctor says you can't go to school full time. Oh, I'm blind. I can't go to so I read, I read everything that I could on the VA website, basically. So mostly, most of the stuff that I know now is from the VA website. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. And do you currently go on there to learn about benefits? 

P1: Yes. In fact, the most recent one was somebody told me that I was entitled to a treadmill as a blind person, because other blind people did. So I actually found the site, I found the whole law that says I'm entitled to home exercise equipment, if it's medically necessary. And it only took me a year and a half of fighting with the VA to get it, but I got it.

Moderator: But you got it. Yay, happy endings. And you said you had read about that. Did you hear about that from another person or did you read about that? 

P1: I've heard about it from another person. 

Moderator: From another, okay.

P1: However, that does you no good when somebody says, no, we don't do that, we've never done it. So I had to go back and find the information on the VA website. Hey, this is your regulation, here's your regulation, and here's the law. And then they go, oh, okay, now we'll look into it. 

Moderator: Okay, okay. Well, you eventually got what you were entitled to, so that's good news. 

P1: Yes. And I try to find it on the VA website first and then take it to my doctor and go here. 

Moderator: Okay, let's take it direct the doctor. Excellent. All right. And so burial benefits. It sounds like you learned everything from your family. Whether or there had you had you also read any any burial benefit information on the website or the

P1: I did. I found I I said, okay, because here was my issue. I I'm not married, and I have no children. Yeah. So I went to the website, and I could be buried there. And I said, Okay, I want to be buried with my parents and my two brothers. And I think I found it that I could on the on the VA website. And so when I buried my father, I took my DD-214 up there and said, Here, make keep room for me. And they were like, we don't do this. And I, you know, pulled it up and they were like, Oh, I guess we can. Okay. 

Moderator: Oh, so they didn't realize. Interesting. 

P1: Yeah, they didn't realize there that they could do it. They weren't sure. And I'm like, it's child, why can't I be buried there? You know, I'm entitled to a plot. You know. 

Moderator: So okay. And was this directly with that cemetery or with the National Cemetery Association? 

P1: I did it twice, I did it with the National Cemetery Association first, and then when I went there, I said, keep room for me, because I knew to bring my DD-214 to make arrangements there. 

Moderator: Uh-huh. Okay. And I assume you knew to bring the DD14 from your family or do you read that somewhere else? 

P1: No, that was on, that was probably the website. It was 10 years ago when I did this. Okay, got it. So it was either talking to the National Cemetery people or just looking it up online. 

Moderator: Okay, got it, got it. Have there been other places that you have seen any sort of burial benefits mentioned? 

P1: Yes. You get it from funeral homes. Okay. Sometimes they say are you a veteran, you could be entitled to this. Okay. And that's, that's bad. Maybe the the DAV may run some or something like that. But or the Military Officers Association. They print up books on your benefits, veterans benefits. I think I saw it in the Florida Veterans Guide. 

Moderator: Okay. 

P1: Veteran Benefits Guide. 

Moderator: Got it. Okay. Great. All right. And so, so I know you had been involved, of course, in planning your father's funeral. Did you know ahead of time what your father's wishes were exactly? 

P1: Yes, I did. We had that discussion. 

Moderator: Oh, you'd had discussion. Okay, got it.

P1: I had the discussion. He lived to be 95. And it was, you know, when he told me and my, and what, of course, my brother was supposed to be the executor, but my brother died six months before my father died, such a crushing blow for them. 

Moderator: Got it. 

P1: And my brother, yeah, so my father told me. In fact, he told me, bury my ashes there, but he promised his father that he wasn't going to be buried alone. So he had me take some of his ashes and go to his father's grave and just dig him into the soil there, so he wouldn't be buried alone. And next month I'm going to bury my two sisters with my grandfather. So it's all working out. So my grandfather won't be alone and my father got to be with his two sons and my mother. 

Moderator: Yeah, yeah. Okay, got it. So we talked about it. Okay, so you clearly have had plenty of conversations.

P1: Yes. 

Moderator: Was there anything logistics-wise that had been planned ahead of time or any like references you had to pull up? 

P1: When he died, the plan was to keep his ashes with my mom until she died. They were married 72 years. So was comforting for my mother to know that my father's ashes were right there with her. 

Moderator: Yeah. 

P1: And then after my mother died, and I had her ashes, I was able to plan a burial, you know, a couple months later, I wasn't in a rush to do that. And it was just a matter of calling the cemetery and letting them know date and time. 

Moderator: Oh, okay. And was there anything? So okay, so you're trying to get the order right here. So your father had had already set up the plot with the funeral. I'm sorry, with the cemetery. 

P1: Well, because my brothers had been buried there since 1960. 

Moderator: Right. Okay. Okay. Got it. So it's just a matter of. 

P1: 60-something, yeah, 60- 

Moderator: This matter of calling them, was there anything that you had to provide to the cemetery? 

P1: Um, yes. His death certificate. 

Moderator: Oh, okay. Makes sense. 

P1: And that, that was pretty much it. Um, and my mother's death certificate and just making the arrangement to go there because the plot was already there since 1965. So yeah, it was obvious it was his because of, you know, he, he got it. 

Moderator: Yeah, okay. So everything was already taken care of ahead of time. And then tell me about any what sort of thought I need very started to explain but your own wishes for your burial. Yeah, what's where's that stand? 

P1: I, at this time, I know that I'll be buried in the National Cemetery. Because again, I have no children, and no husband. So I do have some nieces that would make sure that I was buried properly. Unlike, you know, I'm keeping my brother in the in the garage right now, until I get him buried at sea with the because he was in the Navy. But anyway, so my wishes are to be buried in the plot with my parents and my two brothers. And there is enough room, as long as I'm cremated. And some and it's in my will. 

Moderator: Oh, okay, great. 

P1: Yeah, so they just have to get my ashes up there and bury me. I don't really care if anybodyâ€™s there or not. I don't need it. I don't need any of that. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. Okay, so you said you said it's in your will, you've got a couple nieces and nephews who are gonna take care of that. Do you recall what prompted you to start thinking and making arrangements like letting people know what you're

P1: Yes, it was. We ran into some problems with the will and some money and a house after my father died. And, you know, there was a niece that never did anything that said, Oh, no, I'm entitled to, you know, more of this. And I was like, Okay, it wasn't very clear.

I didn't, I didn't use a lawyer when I did this stuff. Because, and so I said, I better have it put in my will exactly what I want to have done. Because otherwise, it's not going to do I got, I was helping my parents die. And, and getting my father cremated after he died was was difficult, you know, because you're, you're in grief, and you're mourning, you don't want to have to pick a funeral home and and all of this stuff. So for my mom, I said, Mom, I'm gonna get you a cremation thing already. So we got that for my mom. So when she died, it was a piece of cake. She was taken off there cremated, I picked up the cremation remains, and then all I had to do is get them into up to New York from Florida. So that's, you know, it was it was parents dying and brother and realizing what a pain in the neck this is at this point in my life, and I know I'm going to die. So

Moderator: Yeah, yeah. Okay, so just seeing what problems can occur and trying to mitigate? 

P1: Yes, yes. Yeah, mitigate issues for other people. And make sure I'm getting what I want. Yeah, I'm not being left to somebody's whim, who's gonna go, oh, no, it's just, you know, I'm not gonna spend her money, I get all of her money. So why should I spend it on her? I'm just gonna put her in the garage. So we clean it out and somebody throws and throws the ashes out that happened to my cousin. Mother was in the garage for so many years and then the son cleaned the garage out and threw out. 

Moderator: Oh, wow. Okay. Okay, so you said you have it in your will. Has there been any other way that you have let your relatives and others around you know what you want? 

P1: Yes, my niece was there at my parents funeral. And she was there when I was arranging with the cemetery to be buried there. So and, and her, both of her sets of grandparents happened to be buried in the same cemetery. So she knows that I want to be there because she was there with me and I've told her this

Moderator: Okay, so plenty of conversations, got it? 

P1: Yes. 

Moderator: All right, and so does she know like first step once you do passive? 

P1: I have a book I've been I've been putting together a very large binder with all of these important things you know where my money is where I want my guide dog to go should I die you know the important things so yeah very organized and and I guess my niece I her my sister her mother died maybe five years ago and there was nothing and the two of us had to go through her house and I thought I will never let anybody do this yeah for me I hope nobody has to do this for me and so so you know she and I worked on that together and you know we talked about it

Moderator: Yeah, plenty of communication there. So have you come across, it sounds like everything is very well organized on your end, which is impressive. And I guess, how much are you familiar with the pre-need burial benefit? 

P1: Pre-need burial benefit. I'm not sure I know about that. 

Moderator: Okay, so what it is, is it is something that you apply for on the VA that where if you if you are choosing to be buried in a VA National Cemetery, it's it's something you you apply for and they will tell you if you are eligible or not eligible to be buried in

P1: Oh, okay. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. Well, I understand the concept, you know, am I eligible to be buried? And usually it's and so I think I did that. 

Moderator: Oh, you did.

P1: Because of the well, maybe not on the app, but I had my DD 214. And I had to take it to the cemetery. Yep. And they've already approved me to be buried there. So

Moderator: Okay, got it. So do you recall so I know so you you were physically taking the paper to the cemetery? Okay, and did you do you recall if there isn't anything else you might have filled out or do you literally just walk in and 

P1: No, just so I, you know what, and I may have done it on the, on the VA website, 10 years ago. It's not something that I remember at this time. Because I, I know I'm, I know I'm ready. I have, you know, I retired from the army with an honorable discharge. I know I'm eligible. 

Moderator: All right got it and okay so you learned so you so you believe you you learned about it about about a decade ago when you're 

P1: Yeah, yeah. Are you eligible to be buried? And I'm like, well, of course I am, you know, but 

Moderator: Yeah, and was that, do you recall, was that something that the cemetery had brought up? 

P1: No, because I was researching the VA website and the VA benefits. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. 

P1: That, you know, at that time, as my parents were dying, I was like, Well, where am I going to be buried? Oh, you know what, I could be buried there, I think. So yeah, it was a, it was a long process. And you know, the result was yes, I could. So I forgot, you know, I just did a brain dump of everything that I did for it. 

Moderator: Yeah, okay, so you said it was a long process. 

P1: I don't think it was a long process. I think it was just filling out a few questions on the VA website, and then they came back with you're eligible. 

Moderator: Okay, do you recall I know I granted I realized this a decade ago so I don't expect you to remember everything but do you recall like either how much time had passed for you heard or if there were any next steps or do you recall what your experience was there. 

P1: I thought that the answer came back pretty quickly. Yeah, I think the answer came back pretty quickly, like days. I don't think it was a lengthy timeline, like filling out, you know, for for the GI Bill or your VEEP benefits or anything. So. 

Moderator: Okay, so pretty fairly quick. Do you remember how they had let you know the decision? 

P1: I think I found it inside of my VA benefits website. It's a very complicated website, the VA, you know, with all your benefits and getting your letters and things like that. So it's a big massive website. So

Moderator: There's I agree. There's a lot in there. I am. I definitely have not explored everything because, as you said, there is a lot though. 

P1: Exactly, I get someplace. And then the next time I want to go there, I can't figure it out again. 

Moderator: Oh, that is not ideal, I will say. So when you said you believe you had found it within your account on the VA site, do you have any recollection of like how you had found it or how you even knew? 

P1: I don't know. I want to say it was a letter. It was a print up that authorizes you. 

Moderator: Got it. Okay. 

P1: Because I think you need that letter to take to other people, you know. 

Moderator: Okay. And was that the letter, or was that one of the letters that you brought to the cemetery? 

P1: I don't remember. I just remember bringing my DD-214. I may have brought another letter, but. 

Moderator: Okay, so let's, yeah, I'll stop trying to have you remember things from 10 years ago because I certainly can't do that very well, but what in, I guess an ideal world, like if you were to, obviously you already have applied for, but if you were to apply for this pre-need burial and knowing you got the letter saying, yes, you're eligible, what would be the easiest in terms of making sure that letter was safe or like letting people know who would need to use it, what do you think would be the easiest for you? 

P1: Just a, I guess a digital form of the letter that I could print out and put in my book and email to a relative, I think, or give to my, put it in with my funeral home stuff. If I buy the, you know, cremation thing. 

Moderator: And is that part of your large point? 

P1: Yes. I haven't bought the cremation thing because I'm not sure I'm going to be here. As soon as I buy my, go into a community care facility thing, then I'll buy it. Because I know that I'm not going to move from there. 

Moderator: Got it, OK. 

P1: And, you know, I'm still debating whether I want to live in Florida with hurricanes or not. 

Moderator: Excellent question. Okay, so you'd want a digital copy of that letter so you can email it to other people. They can have an and to put it into your binder. Would there be anything else that you would think of that could be helpful?

P1: Maybe even a digital card on the wallet. 

Moderator: Oh, okay, interesting, yeah.

P1: And I know that those cost money every month because we were using it, but that would be interesting to have it in your digital wallet. 

Moderator: Oh, okay. So can you say more about that, like how you might use that? 

P1: Well, I do know that after after relatives have died, one of the most important things to get, especially when they haven't left you anything to do this with my brother and sister is access to their phone. Yeah, because you have access to their email and their banking. And once you have their email, you can, you know, reset the password. And then you have access to everything on their phone and you could be them and nobody even knows that they're dead yet unless you tell them because you are working through the phone.

So you would have the wallet and, you know, their credit cards and memberships, which all, you know, have to get canceled and things. And then you could just have this. Oh, you are authorized to be buried at a national cemetery. Just thinking of the top of my head. 

Moderator: Yeah, no, I like it. I'm just curious to know to know more. Okay, so you'd want it also on on your phone or whoever's phone in a in a in a centralized place where whoever could actually I mean,

P1: I have my Florida ID now. It used to be my driver's license and that exists on my phone in an app, so why not inside the Apple or Google Wallet on a phone? Because that's what a lot of people have as a smartphone. And as long as you have their code or face ID or fingerprint, it's hard to get it off a dead person. But I knew my sister well enough to know what her codes would be. So yeah, that would be interesting. 

Moderator: Okay, okay, so have it, have it in a central location. 

P1: Even a VA benefits like your VA card. There's digital VA card that I have to apply for, I think. But it's the same thing, you know, I, I don't go anywhere without my phone, I may forget my wallet, I may lose my wallet, but I'm never going to leave my phone. So yeah. 

Moderator: Yeah, that's, I think that's a pretty typical experience right there. Yeah. Anything else that you can think of that will be helpful from the VA in regards to this eligibility letter. 

P1: It may be nice if some people have caregivers and things like that, but to have a next of kin inside of that. So because one of the things that you do report, you report to the VA that the person is dead. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. 

P1: So what would be helpful is actually, you know what? When my brother died, I guess they found out because social security finds out and then they share that information. There was nobody for me at the VA to tell when my brother died, so that would be great; report a death of a veteran. And then have the next of kin listed who gets information automatically. 

Moderator: Okay. Is that like, is that something that the VA would know knows right now who's the next to kin is I'm actually not familiar with that aspect. 

P1: Well, they do because they, well, they have, they ask you, who do we call in case of emergency? 

Moderator: Oh, yes, of course. 

P1: And, and I know, I know that because, you know, my brother was dying, they called me. But I got nothing from them. I mean, so it would be great if you could set that up. Hey, here's here's stuff that I want you to provide to my next of kin when they report me dead. And you know, how do you report somebody dead, you need a death certificate. That's, you know, I would think that the VA would want to know, when you died. So they didn't seem to be interested in my brother's death. So 

Moderator: Okay, got it. All right. I am going to, so first, we're going to do a little screen sharing now. So you could definitely turn off your camera. I know you said you wanted to have your camera off at that point. So I'll let you do that first. And then do you know how to share your screen on the Zoom app here? If not, I can walk you through. 

P1: I do know how to share my screen, there we go. 

Moderator: You should take a moment to show up on my end. 

P1: Okay, and screen, broadcast, zoom, start, broadcast. 

Moderator: Okay, it sounds positive. Okay, I did it for a second and then went back. So I'm not sure what happened. 

P1: Oh, I, it was starting to do it and then I hit it again and Oh, you know, I've done that. Yeah. Oh, 

Moderator: There we go, okay, yes. Okay. Cool, I think if you just tap anywhere outside of that, that square in the middle, I should be able to see the rest of the phone. 

P1: Okay, I'm going to turn off my 

Moderator: There we go. All right, now I'm. This is my digital. There's the wall, since we were talking about it. 

P1: Well, that's because the Apple Wallet comes up with two taps and my accessibility comes up with three taps. 

Moderator: Okay. Oh, right, right. Yes, when I've done some accessibility stuff, I have done that same thing. Yes, it depends on how many tasks you've got. 

P1: It says share device. You are sharing screen. 

Moderator: Yes. So we are on. So excellent. Okay. So I'm going to send you a link and let's just see how this works. I'm going to send a message in just a moment. It's being a little slow. Hold on. I'm having problems. This has nothing to do with you.

Come on. I have my screen made a little small. And there we go. Okay. So okay. So if you want to tap on that, this is just going to the VA website. Okay. Okay. And if you that went to, can you try it again? That opened up either a text or a

P1: Oh, I opened up the text message. You said you were sending me a link. Oh, yeah. Sorry. It was in chat. 

Moderator: Yes, exactly. 

P1: Okay. Got it. Got it. Got it. Okay. So I want to go to chat. Got it. Yeah. 

Moderator: Yep. There we go. Perfect. That's going to come up. All right. And then if you want to, I just learned this yesterday, if you want to hold and slide off to the side to hide my, yes, there we go. I just learned it today. It's like, oh, that's handy. 

P1: I've done that by accident so 

Moderator: You know that's that's perfect way to learn how things work.

P1: Yes. Definitely done plenty of that.

Moderator: Okay, so I know you've said you've done plenty of exploration on the site, so you're probably very familiar with everything. Thoughts on, since you've already looked at this a lot, thoughts on if you were looking to find information on planning your own burial. And I certainly don't need you to read everything, but kind of a quick skim just in case you haven't looked at this part in a while. 

P1: On this page, get, okay, get veteran benefits, plan a burial, more information, other VA benefits, okay, get veteran burial benefits, there you go, pre-need burial eligibility. That's good that you broke them down into these little things with highlighted tables rather than the big paragraph up front, at least for me, because I also know even sighted people don't always read. 

Moderator: You know, that's true. I'll speak from personal experience, Yes 

P1: Um, uh, the burial allowance, um, benefits for burial or memorialization. Yep. And then, um, a bereavement counseling and benefits for spouse independence. And planning a burial, um, more information and resources. 

Moderator: Okay, yeah, I won't have you. I know that's that's a lot there.

P1: It is another VA benefits and services. 

Moderator: Yep. So I know you said at the start that that you liked that there there was a lot of things highlighted. Yes, broken things out. In in terms of planning or in terms of finding information on planning for your own burial. Does this do you think this does as well was there other information that you think you might be looking for? 

P1: Um, I think, yeah, you've, um, let me come up here. Yeah, I think it works it pretty clearly. Um, pre need burial eligibility determination. Um, I wonder how many people actually apply for that because they go in their head, like me, they're going, I know I'm eligible. 

Moderator: Okay. Can you say more? 

P1: I'm an honorable, you know, I'm honorably discharged, and I get VA medical benefits, you know, so and I'm, you know, 50% disabled, of course I'm eligible. So I applied for pre need eligibility decision letter. This can help you pre plan for burial in a VA National Cemetery, and make the process easier for your family members in the time of need. And I guess that's good. Because I'm going, I don't need pre need, I know I'm eligible. But when the comes time for the family, that's when they're going to have a problem. Because the family doesn't know where the DD-214 is. And the VA, you know, who knows, you know, I know there's somebody that works with them. So but yeah, in my head, I go, I don't need a pre need burial, I know I'm eligible. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. Would there be anything that you think so I know like after you read that that little paragraph then it became clear that you would be helpful with their? 

P1: I think I think the answer is it makes the process easier for your family members. I think that's the big thing up there and you put it down at the end. 

Moderator: OK, got it, got it. OK. 

P1: Maybe something like, why do I need this? You know, I find sometimes that questions are better than a statement for some people. So I mean, other people read it, but 

Moderator: Okay, got it. Would there be importance making it easier for the family? Do you have a sense if there are other questions or other things you would want to know regarding this eligibility determination? 

P1: Um, how long is it good for? Mm. Okay. But I, you know, if I got it 15 years ago, am I still eligible? 

Moderator: Okay. Okay. Let me have you tap on that pre-need burial link there. Okay. 

P1: Mm-hmm 

Moderator: Wait for that to come up. So yeah, this is similar as what you had already read there. So in a sense, you've already filled this out, obviously. We don't need to have you pretend to fill anything out again, but. 

P1: Again, it was 10 years ago and I wasn't blind then, so. 

Moderator: It's certainly a different experience, I got it. So I know at the beginning when we were talking about desktop versus phone, that you definitely generally prefer to be on a computer for things. Is that the same here? Let's pretend you were going to be filling out this. 

P1: Yeah, because I'm, it's a lot of writing and you see me, you know, making my screen bigger. I don't know if you can see that. Yes, okay. Okay. And then I have to scroll across the whole line to read it, you know, if I'm not using my, my talk. 

Moderator: I was just about to ask if you use VoiceOver. 

P1: I would just ask Siri to read it to me or use the quick, you know, Safari read thing like this. 

Moderator: Okay, so it sounds like it's just a a slower process if you're it is yeah got it okay got it 

P1: And on the computer, you know, I would probably just I would be bigger and the contrast would be better and things like that. So 

Moderator: Okay, got it. All right. For any sort of form like this, do you ever request help from anyone or are you doing everything on your own? 

P1: Pretty much. I will try to do it on my own. Sometimes I get tired and I'll call the phone number and say, hey, I'm blind. Can you please help me fill this out? And they do. Usually the help number will in most places. 

Moderator: Okay great. Got it. So if you... 

P1: Or they'll stay on the phone while I'm filling it out to make sure that I'm hitting the right buttons and everything. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. So if you could skim through this page and determining what you would need to actually fill us out, even though you've already done it a while ago, I'd love to get a sense of just how easy or difficult you feel it would be to actually gather the information for it. 

P1: Okay. A veteran who didn't receive a dishonorable discharge, okay. Or the spouse of a dependent child. The spouse? Oh, or dependent child. What dependent child is married? Wait a second. Is this West Virginia? Okay. Service member, veteran. Okay. So family members could also be looking at this too. And in some cases, the adult dependent child of a service member. Okay. And then

Moderator: Maybe just scroll down a little bit just because there is a lot of text there. 

P1: Yeah, get more details about eligibility. I'm not seeing anything that says if I need paperwork on here or not. So reforms, find a cemetery. This application doesn't apply to Arlington. I knew that. But that's good that it's on there because a lot of people want that getting a pre-need determination of eligibility doesn't guarantee you'll be, yes, and I knew that. And some of them, you don't have plots anymore. You could go into a wall gathering. There's a supporting documents. Okay. Please see the list below. If you don't have everything on the list, the list below is, as I quickly scroll through, I'm not seeing a list. Okay. Did I pass it? 

Moderator: This is not clear, that's good to know. 

P1: There you go. Social, okay, what information do I need to apply for? It says please see the list below. Okay. Social security, date and place of birth, military status and service history, like service date and discharge paperwork. And this all confuses me because you guys know this. In my account, I'm like, what are they talking about? If I log into my account on the VA, you know, they should have all of this. 

Moderator: Okay, so it sounds like you feel like they don't actually need what they're asking for. 

P1: Well, I understand how they could because I have one brother who never used the VA. And we couldn't find anything on him. And he couldn't find it either. I know he was in Vietnam, but apparently they lost his records. So so so yeah, I could see that. Okay, I for for people who've had nothing to do with the military since they got out. And that's a lot of veterans. Then this is useful. Okay. And this is useful for the family members of people who said, Oh, yeah, he did serve, you know, but he had never had anything to do for the VA. So now I can understand this. Okay. 

Moderator: Okay, good. So I'm just gonna pause you right there. So I know you said you filled out other forms in the past. Have you filled out anything more recent, just in the past, maybe a couple years or so? 

P1: Um, with the VA. Yes. Um, yeah, when I went blind, I had to, um, submit eligibility that was like in 2020, 2021 for, um, for going to school. 

Moderator: Uh-huh. And was there, after you had submitted things, was there any, let's say like waiting time or were there next steps you were expecting? 

P1: Yes, there was a lot of stuff was getting a counselor taking a test. They had a blind woman take a timed online test.

Moderator: Oh, okay. 

P1: With English and math questions. And then filling out forms and waiting for them to get back to me. 

Moderator: Okay, so the waiting, how was that experience? 

P1: Oh, you know what? Oh, no, I do this all the time. I do it yearly with the Winter Clinic. The VA offers a Winter Sports Clinic and a golf clinic, and I applied for the Winter Clinic in November, I guess October, November, and they got back to me, I think mid-December. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. And did you know like what you're waiting for? What any next steps would have been? 

P1: Yeah, I've done it before. They send me a packet in the mail and an email with instructions on how to get the hotel room and, you know, plane flights and what I want to do at the clinic. Do I want to, you know, go downhill skiing or scuba diving or whatever? So, yeah. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. So that was you said that was that was mailed and emailed to you. 

P1: Yes. 

Moderator: Got it. Okay. Were there, are there other places you might have wanted any sort of communication from them in terms of what next steps might have been?

P1: No, they there's a there's a person who who is a point of contact and responds pretty quickly to questions. And then and then yeah, since this is a national event, there are people like in my main VA that that helped me with certain things. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. I am going to send over almost that time, I'm going to quickly send you another link. So if you can go back, actually, it might just pop up, but I'm going to send you a link to a prototype. And you may need to go I think you'll need to go back to Zoom to see it. Okay. So Nope. Oh, that I'm like, scroll to the I think the window to your left actually. 

P1: Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, there we go. 

Moderator: That's right so and then someone yeah yeah okay so tap on that uh very long this link yeah it's a very long link right there got it okay um so we'll see how i'll say we'll see how this works because um it things may be too small to see okay applied pre-need yeah so i'll just kind of narrate things so what we're looking at is a prototype of the application okay so they count we can

P1: See, there you go. They know who I am. Okay. Yes. 

Moderator: So tap on the, okay, you did that. And then, so this is a representation of if you were actually filling out the form on your phone. 

P1: Seven, Okay, that's good to know. 

Moderator: Yeah, so scroll down and tap the continue on the lower right. I'm going to get due to a certain screen and then ask a couple questions. And one more to the continue button on the lower left. Okay, so supporting files. So we already look

P1: Ooh, I'm in six to seven. See, that's good. Okay

Moderator: Jumped ahead, just like magic. Okay, so we talked about the various information that you would need to upload. Thoughts on, I know we talked about the DD214, that they need any thoughts on potentially uploading from here. 

P1: Upload file. That's pretty standard. If I clicked it, it would then allow me to go to the browser. Should I click it? 

Moderator: No, so not a lot of work, so we're just going to talk through things, but yeah, and I'll read things. One of the things it says is file types you can upload are PDF, JPEG, and PNG. Okay. That's good to know. Yeah. So any thoughts on, let's say you had your DD-214 on potentially uploading it? 

P1: I love it. They give me the maximum size. That's good. And the types. Okay. Okay. I don'tâ€¦ I think I could do this. And I love to finish this application later. 

Moderator: Okay, good. 

P1: Because, you know, if you're a family member, you start going and it's like, Whoa, okay.

Moderator: Okay, got it. 

P1: And can I mail and fax. Always good option. Yeah, that's good. Okay. 

Moderator:Okay, so you've got the information you need here. Now, I know you said that you generally prefer to do things on your computer. Do you see any potential benefits for instead doing this application on your phone? 

P1: I keep a lot of my important documents like my DD-214 on my phone also, so that looks pretty easy, you know, pictures of my ID card and things like that, so I could access them on my phone. 

Moderator: Okay, that's good to know. Okay, so you could actually upload things. And let me have you scroll to the bottom. 

P1: And also, you can easily take a picture of the file and then upload it, except my camera doesn't do these. I think my camera is an HEIC file, but okay. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. It's a potential problem with the camera. Go ahead and click the submit button on the lower right. 

P1: Which would be a great option: Take a picture. 

Moderator: Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah, so click the submit button on the lower right. And then, so we'll pretend that you have submitted. There's no need to read anything here, but just as we're almost out of time, but just a couple more questions. Let's say you have already just finished applying for this pre-need burial benefit. What sort of communication might you want? Or what would you expect to happen in terms of being told what any next steps might be? 

P1: I would expect to have an email in my inbox after I hit submit, told me what I did and what I could expect next. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. 

P1: Who to contact in case I don't get it in a timely manner. 

Moderator: Got it. And how about in terms of any additional updates, would you expect to see or hear them anywhere else? 

P1: I would expect to see it in my VA account. 

Moderator: Do you know, actually, if you tap on the Continue button on the lower. OK, yeah. And then click on the the pink, go to my VA. OK, there we go. So this is a pretend. 

P1: Yeah, that's where I would also expect to see it. There and appeals. Yep. 

Moderator: Okay, so you would expect to see something within this here? 

P1: Yes, I would expect to see that I have filed and the status of where it is. Sometimes, you know, it's like, Yeah, we're, we finished your claim. It's in the process of this, you should be getting a letter.

Moderator: Got it. Okay. 

P1: I hit the wrong thing, sorry. 

Moderator: No, actually, you did it right. So I just scroll down again. Okay. And then scroll all the way to the bottom. And then go to the yellow, go to my VA app. And then, yeah. The pretend app, of course. Okay. How about any thoughts here of where you might want to see any, if at all? 

P1: Health, you wouldn't see it in health. Somehow I got messages, I guess. But I thought that was my VA. This is my I don't know how I got to my VA. 

Moderator: Oh, yeah, this is

P1: Activity, appointments, claims, I would expect to see it in messages or claims. 

Moderator: Got it. Okay. Well, we are one minute over and I apologize, but I will end this here. So this has been extremely helpful [REDACTED]. Thank you so much. 

P1: Jump into my other 10 o'clock meeting now. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. All right, well, thank you so much, and I hope you have- 

P1: Glad I can help. 

Moderator: Yes, all right, thank you, take care. 

P1: All right, bye-bye. 

Moderator: Thank you.
