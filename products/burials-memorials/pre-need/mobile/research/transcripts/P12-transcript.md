# P12

[Moderator] : It starts so to confirm are you.

[P12] : Are you comfortable?

[Moderator] : I record screen and audio as we talk today.

[P12] : Yes, ma'am.

[Moderator] : Okay? And are you okay with us, potentially using clips from this session to share with Va partners.

[P12] : Yes, ma'am.

[Moderator] : Okay, great. Okay. Now, we're actually gonna to get into discussion.

[P12] : Ask a question. Can I say something before you start? I am not the techiest person, so if you tell me to do something I may. I may need help, because I've done the zoom thing like 2 2 times.

[Moderator] : No problem. I am here to help. So we we're gonna get through this. But 1, st first, st we're just gonna talk. There's nothing nothing technical for Lisa's 1st part.

[P12] : Okay.

[Moderator] : So okay, so I would love to know a little bit about you as a veteran. What branch of the military did you serve? And when did you retire or separate?

[P12] : I am! I did  : Oh, my God, my! My! I entered in 78 into the army. I got out in 84 and did 6 years.  : And that's it. I usually go to the Va. For all my cares, which, thank goodness, I have one like half an hour away, and I actually love my Va.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it that you led into? My next question was, what sort of involvement? Okay, so you have all your care through the Va, and especially so have you. Have you used the Va website and or app.

[P12] : Yes, I have.

[Moderator] : Okay, are you using that? On your phone on a computer, a mix. How do you.

[P12] : On my tablet and on my phone, depending on where I'm at. And you know, if it's something that I need right away, I may be out somewhere. Then I'd use my phone.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? So since you mentioned if you need something right away, you're out and about, you'll use your phone. Are there other reasons that you might use your phone as opposed to your tablet.

[P12] : No, just convenience. The tablet is better, because it's actually bigger.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P12] : So the tablet is more convenient. I don't have a home computer. I don't have really have a need for a computer.

[Moderator] : Got it. Okay?  : Yes, you're doing a lot of things on the tablet for for size. Any any other reason? Besides the size of it that you would choose the tablet over the phone.  : No, no.  : got it all right. So speaking broadly, of all benefits that you are entitled to as a veteran. How have you learned about what you are entitled to.

[P12] : There's an 800 number. I don't remember exactly what it was, but it's an 800 number, for I think, like veterans affair. I believe that's the title of it, and if I don't know, something doesn't matter what it is, even if it's I. Usually I find a way.  : I will find a way.

[Moderator] : I like it.

[P12] : So usually veterans affair, and if I may call them for something that I think it's their business. But they say, No, no, you have to call this number, then be really good about it, and I'm usually they've been usually leading me down the right path.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? Any. So you you call this number are there other resources where you have learned about any benefits?

[P12] : If I go to an appointment they might have a sheet or something, and I you know I look into it.  : Yeah. But or if I see something that I might see something on TV that doesn't make sense a lot of times, it might be just fake, but I still try to. You know I call my daughters because they're a little savvier than I am like. Nope, that's not good.  : But usually, if if something comes to mind with any kind of subject, whether it be Va related or just, you know, a tomato is good for you, I, Google it. I'm like, Oh, wait a minute. Then I call my one of my kids, and they're like, No, ma, don't do that. Don't touch that. Don't do that, and my son-in-law is still in the service. He's been in there [REDACTED]. I believe it is so. If I have a question I can always go to him, and he.

[Moderator] : Okay. Good.

[P12] : About that, too.

[Moderator] : Got it? Got it. So since you mentioned Googling things, do you? Do you research any benefits online? Or is that? Or is that just for googling other things.

[P12] : No, because I I don't trust that they might be correct, so I might just get like an an inkling as to wait. This is this, I may be entitled to this, but if I have any question, I think that 800 number is like the best way to go to me. I've I've never had a bad experience with them.

[Moderator] : Okay, good, great. And then how about specifically any burial benefits? Are you aware? When did you learn about them?

[P12] : Yeah, I actually learned because I had the cremains of a veteran that died in New York. So they when we came here. I'm like, you know what I'm going to look into into having these Cremains put in, you know, into, you know, proper cemetery and whatnot. And I called that 800 number. They guided me. I did  : fantastic. I did it within, I think. Within a week I think everything was solved, and I called that same 800 number. And I said, You know what I need to be thinking about. My. You know my burial site as well, and I spoke to a rep, I told her, well, I already have my pre needs already done. I've done that when I was in New York, and I said, What am I entitled to. This is the time I served. They verified everything and everything is done. I'm done. I call my kids. You call 1 800. She done died, and I'm taken care of.

[Moderator] : Easy enough.  : I got it. So I know you. So you started about you started to describe the the remains you had, and you had called to get the burial. Have there been? Have you had other involvement in planning of anyone's funeral before.

[P12] : Yes.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay, good. And did you know ahead of time the any, any wishes that that that the deceased had had.

[P12] : Well, we actually just we're going to bury my mother. She she got cremated. She's going to be. She died in Florida, but she's going to be. She's going to be buried in New York, and so I have her Cremains here. So we already knew we knew what outfit she wanted. She already had prepaid for her stuff. All we needed to do was get them for the repass. So that's all. Everything was.  : We knew what she wanted, that it was taken care of, and I've done the same thing for myself. And so my children know exactly what I need or what I want.

[Moderator] : Okay, yeah. So you said you, you've done the same. How? How has that been communicated?

[P12] : What do you mean?

[Moderator] : Like, is it? Have you told them verbally what you want? Do you have something written down? Is there any sort of document.

[P12] : Well, I have. I have my my pre, my pre- needs. It's already taken care of. It's already done. But I also talk to them all the time. They don't want to hear it, but I do talk to them  : so.

[Moderator] : All right, got it? And do you recall what prompted you to? So so since you you said you, you already have the the pre- needs done.  : What had prompted you to start considering what you might want.

[P12] : Back in, I want to say, Oh, 7, or maybe oh, 8. I don't remember how the conversation started, but my sister spoke to me about it. I was still in New York at that time. My mother had. I had already purchased a house here. My mother was living in my house. I have no idea how it started, but I'm like, you know. Look into it for me, let me know. Give me a number to call, and she went to a local place that they have here, and I got to speaking with them, and I did mines, and I did. Mommy's.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. And so you went to a local place was that a, a, funeral, home, or, a better or.

[P12] : It was a funeral home with a cremation site on.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. Okay? So you would. You had gone there to like, set things up and.

[P12] : Yeah, just to see what it was, but it and everything. So I I did mines. And I did. Mommy's at the same time.

[Moderator] : Okay, you got all those and so you said, you talk to your family, even if they don't want to hear it. But you've you've told them and do they know like, where where to go for any any information? When, whenever you, whenever you do, pass.

[P12] : Well, there's a number. There's a number, there's an 800 number. They they have to call, and it's it's that it's to the funeral home and the Funeral home themselves will call the V. 8 the the cemetery, and get all that straightened out. But everything.

[Moderator] : Let's okay.

[P12] : Yeah, it's connected.

[Moderator] : Oh, okay, got it.

[P12] : Okay.

[Moderator] : And do you have since you mentioned you've already filed the pre-need. Is that also with the funeral home.

[P12] : Yeah, the punitis with the funeral home. Yes.

[Moderator] : It? Okay?  : Alright. And so how do you? How? How had you made sure that that they had access to that.

[P12] : Because I called after I, after I had spoken to to the V. 8 about you know where my Cremains will be late either late to rest or put them in a in a niche. Whatever my daughters decide. That's not a whatever, not an issue.  : I call. I don't remember why I called a funeral home, and I said to them, You know I have this and this and this and that, he said, Give me give me the information they took down the information. Somehow it just popped into my head. Honestly, I don't even know how it popped into my head, and I called them and say, Yeah, yeah, we could take care of that. Your daughter just had called us. And it is we're all get everything connected. We have all the information. Yeah.

[Moderator] : Okay, sounds like they were organizing on.

[P12] : Yeah, they really. Yeah. I'm sure they've done it a few other times.

[Moderator] : Alright got it? Got it all right. And do you recall was it calling the Va. That you had learned about the pre- need application.

[P12] : No, I I learned I I got the pre needs in oh, 7, 0, 8. I had that done, and I didn't get anything through the Va. Till I moved down here, which might have been 1516. I don't remember exactly when it was.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it.  : And was that sorry? Was that through the the funeral home that you knew about it.

[P12] : No, I call the 800 number.

[Moderator] : That was 800 number.

[P12] : Yeah, that was the 800

[Moderator] : Okay, got it, got it? And before that, had you, had you known about it, or or was that the 1st time you had learned about it when you called that 800 number.

[P12] : Honestly, I didn't think because I only served 6 years. I didn't think I was entitled to any kind of Va. Benefits as far as funeral arrangements. So it was really a good surprise that I did find out, because, if not, I was going to even, do you know, get myself a plot and do whatever I needed to do. So it all it all worked out  : divinely for lack of a better word. Everything worked out really, really good.  : Okay? So so you you originally weren't aware of that, you know.

[Moderator] : Seen any. Well, let me back up.  : Where would you have, I guess, wanted to have learned that you even are eligible, that you know, this this pre needs was was an option.

[P12] : I think now, looking looking back on it, I I believe that  : when when we go to, let's say the clinic or the hospital, they're the same way they advertise, you know, some, whatever they should have a poster up, or something, anything.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P12] : You know what I mean? Because a lot like I live in Florida. So this is like, you know.  : there's a lot of  : of us all people, and you know, even if somebody, even a family member, goes to take them to the to the you know, to the doctor, let's say, because some of them can't drive, and they see a post that says, Hey, you know, whatever you know. Do you have your needs? Do you know what your family member needs, or something to that effect. Even then they say, Hey, let me, ma, do you have this, you know. Do you have these services can I call? Can I find out? Speak to somebody, maybe on staff that could give them some direction.

[Moderator] : okay, got it? Good. Yeah. So so it sounds like, you've you've never seen any sort of like, pamphlet or or poster.

[P12] : I, honestly, I don't remember seeing anything. I may be incorrect, but you know I'm like I said. I live in a small place, so maybe you know just here, and I may be incorrect. But I I personally don't remember seeing anything.  : Okay, got it? And can you tell me what what? What were the various reasons that you decided to apply for the the pre need?  : Oh, my sister talked to me about it, and I'm like, you know what I got 2 kids  : I don't want. I don't. It's not their responsibility to bury me. It is my responsibility, you know. I'm the parent. So, as the same way I take care of whatever I need to do, I say you know what they don't need, and if I would have waited if I would have waited for that. But they wait for me to die. You know how many people, how many leeches for lack of a better word there are in the funeral homes, I mean. I am sorry to say that, but it is a business.  : You know it is a business we we buried. We buried 3 people within 6 months in this, at the same, at the same from the same funeral home, and I even asked him because I got no problem. I said, Are you going to give us some kind of discount? He said, no, okay, cool.  : No, no. Seriously. It was.

[Moderator] : Straight up.

[P12] : You know, I mean  : give us some flowers or something, you know something, you know. Give us an extra hour of viewing anything.  : So you know all that, you know. You think about all that. My kids don't need to be worried. You know you're too drunk with emotion at the time where they will take advantage of you. They see your mother would like this. No, I don't. I don't want none of that stuff.

[Moderator] : Yeah, I got it. Got it. Okay? So with this. The the preview letter. So I know you like that. That set up is with the funeral home. And I forget if you said if you, if you also have a letter at home from that.

[P12] : No, what I have is that they do have a letter that they send, but what I did is, I got a a book, and I wrote it down. My, the numbers. This is what you need to do if I die, and my sister has that that number also.  : You know. Just call this number, and everything's taken care of.

[Moderator] : Okay. Yeah.  : All right, have you? So jumping apart from the pre- need for just a moment? Have you filled out any forms? Obviously you have filled out forms like with this pre-need. Have there been any forms that you filled out online with the Va.  : any any kind of form?  : Yeah, it could be any sort of like any sort of application, or a filing for something.

[P12] : I don't remember filling anything out online for the Va. No.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? How about any so with or how about for any sort of paper applications? But it it sounds like the the Pre. Need was taken care of over the phone. Or were you filling anything out.

[P12] : No, I went in. My sister did it in person.

[Moderator] : When in person. Okay? Got it.

[P12] : And then I did the payments, you know, over there the the Internet, or whatever back, you know, from New York.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay, got it. And do you recall, like, after you had filled out this information for the pre- need?  : were you were were you given any expectations about what was going to? What? What might happen next?

[P12] : Yeah, once, hopefully, I  : you know, because I had. I remember what it was, whatever the payments was, and I did it. And you know. I think it took like 2 years to pay. They put it on. I figured I ain't going away in 2 years, so I took 2 years, and I broke the payment down after it was done. It was done, and no  : once, like I said, my kids call the number, and I'm it's all taken care of.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? Got it? Okay? Do you recall if there was like, or how much, how much waiting period there was before?  : That that paperwork came back after you. You had applied.

[P12] : And wow! We're talking a long time ago.  : No, I don't. I don't even think no, because they sent me I mean, everything was signed.  : And I was just making payments, and if I if I would have died with before that, that dollar, that total was taken care of what my daughters would have to pay whatever balance. You know, whatever balance was due to cover that policy.

[Moderator] : Oh, okay, got it. Got it?

[P12] : But I don't know. I had a I had a national contract.

[Moderator] : Got it? Okay, yeah. How about with with any sort of it could be any any other form. Where there is some sort of waiting period between filling out the the application. And then.  : whatever the next step is could be like. Maybe you're approved for something, or you're sent something have that. Can you think of instances where that was the case?

[P12] : No.

[Moderator] : No. Okay.  : Got it.  : Okay? So we're gonna I'm gonna walk you through. We're gonna try to do some some screen sharing through the the zoom app that you are on. So we will. We will see how this goes. So let me have you. I'm gonna have you tap on the phone, and there should be some menu items on the bottom  : so one of them should say. Should say shared. I think it's on the right hand side. Usually.

[P12] : Yeah, it's right in the center.

[Moderator] : So in the center perfect, even better. Okay, so tap on that.

[P12] : Okay. Shit.

[Moderator] : And then I think there should be an option that says screen after.  : Okay, so tap on that. What comes up next.

[P12] : It says, everything on your screen, including notifications, will be recorded. Enable do not disturb, to prevent unexpected notifications. And then it says, Zoom, and it's checked screen broadcast and start broadcast.

[Moderator] : Okay, yeah, so yeah, we can start the broadcast.

[P12] : Okay.

[Moderator] : Little little countdown.

[P12] : Yes, it's start broadcast, and it's the zoom. There it goes.

[Moderator] : And then you can tap anywhere outside of that center rectangle. There we go! Yay, look at that!  : I love it alright. Now.

[P12] : There it goes. Okay.

[Moderator] : Yep, yep, you're good. Okay. So I am going to send you a link within the chat so that should come up. Okay, there we go the Emily to meeting group chat at the bottom tap that.

[P12] : I went away.

[Moderator] : Oh, so tap, tap it again and at the yeah. So there's a little chat button with a red.

[P12] : Oh, I see it now, your website is okay.

[Moderator] : Okay? So yeah, this is good. So then, perfect, you are doing exactly what you need to. Okay, so we are on  : so this is the actual Va website.  : But this is the burial benefits.  : so I'm gonna so actually, first, st have you, have you looked at at at this section of the website.

[P12] : I really I didn't even notice this was on here. No?  : Well, now you do, but I but I already have all my arrangements.

[Moderator] : Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm yeah. I'm really not expecting you.

[P12] : Oh, cool!

[Moderator] : This is more just kind of seeing how things are laid out. So, even though you were already all set, this is more thinking hypothetically.  : If you were preparing for your own burial, skim through this and see like, is it? Do you think it would be answering the questions that you might have. Is it giving the type of information that you think would be important for someone looking into preparing for their own burial?

[P12] : Yeah, I see it. But I have a quick question. It says eligibility. And then it says, pre need burial, eligibility, determination. What is the difference between 2? Wouldn't it give you the same thing.

[Moderator] : Well, I'm gonna turn that around and ask. So it sounds like that is confusing to you.

[P12] : Yeah, to me. Because, yeah.

[Moderator] : Yep, I will. Make a note about that.

[P12] : Because if you look at it, says eligibility, find out if you qualify for burial in a Va. Cemetery. Okay, cool. But then it says Pre needs eligibility. So aren't you doing one? Aren't you doing the same thing just.

[Moderator] : Right?  : Okay, yeah. So that that making a note that that is confusing.

[P12] : Okay. Okay.

[Moderator] : M.

[P12] : Transportation cost. Okay, benefits. Program had to pay for a head. Some work on medallion presidential. Okay, that's  : that would be step 2 benefit for spouse. Okay, baby, with counseling community counseling. No, I think this is good.

[Moderator] : Okay? Good. Yeah. What sort of thoughts on? Just what kind of questions you think would be important as someone is is is looking for information on preparing.

[P12] : Yeah, if you, if you're preparing, I think once you start that process, I think  : all your all your questions will be answered. I mean for me. That's where you happen they like. This is what we're gonna do. This is what we need to do. And everything was answered.  : So I didn't. I really didn't have a problem.

[Moderator] : Okay.  : Good.

[P12] : Now, what's this?  : Oh, wait! I do have a question, because if you go to pre needs, that's what you qualify for right? So they'll tell you. We'll cover this this and that, but then it says, Learn to apply for a burial allowance to help pay. So even so, whatever you. Is that meaning that whatever you don't qualify for whatever pluses you want on your funeral, they will help you pay for that as well, somehow apply for  : that's what doesn't make sense.

[Moderator] : Okay. Good. I actually, I don't know the answer to that. But I'm that that is, that is unclear, which is what we're here to find out.

[P12] : Yeah, because if if because if you've if you go to pre needs right, and you say, Okay, I qualify for XY, and z right, but you also want like an a, not not XY, and z. 1 a. So  : then then you go to veterans bureau allowance, and they're like how to apply for an allowance so to get a but they tell you you don't qualify for a so how the heck are you going to get an allowance for something you don't qualify. Does that make sense.

[Moderator] : Oh, yeah, yeah. So yeah, so it sounds like, it's just it's it's not clear.

[P12] : Yeah, yeah.

[Moderator] : Guidelines for what's covered.

[P12] : Yeah, cause if it's covered, then you don't have to apply for an ounce.

[Moderator] : Okay.  : Got it? Got it?

[P12] : Parents.

[Moderator] : And thoughts on. So I know you already talked about the confusing bit on. We've got eligibility. And then pre-need burial eligibility. How about the admittedly rather brief  : description of pre-need thoughts on how that description reads.

[P12] : Apply for a premium unlimited decision that this can help you. No, that's fine.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay.

[P12] : No, yeah. The wording is good.

[Moderator] : Okay, great alright and let me have you tap on that. And again, of course I'm not. Gonna have you fill anything out or sign.

[P12] : Who needs.

[Moderator] : Like that. Yeah. Sorry. Pre-need.

[P12] : Okay, okay, it is giving me pretty neat eligibility for burial in a Va. Cemetery.

[Moderator] : Yep. So we've got the the application here. And so you said you didn't think you had filled out any applications online. Is that right?

[P12] : I don't believe so. I may be I may be wrong. We talked a long time ago.

[Moderator] : Yeah, yeah, okay.

[P12] : Yeah, I'm sure they probably had to do the Dd 2, 14 give my social security or something. I'm sure they did something, cause they did send me a letter back.  : you bet.

[Moderator] : Yeah, you got that. Okay.

[P12] : And.

[Moderator] : Well, you know, we're gonna pretend that you have not already gotten that taken care of. But so skimming through this I'd love to get your thoughts on  : overall. How easy or difficult it appears to prepare to apply here.

[P12] : Okay, find out how to schedule.  : Hmm.  : Why would you want to find out how to schedule a burial when you still don't have the pre-needs that shouldn't even be there. I don't think so. But anyway, you know what I mean, it's like they're putting like, Okay, we're going to bury somebody, but we still don't have the pre needs that to me. That's my thinking. Okay, how do I prepare before starting?  : What find out if you're eligible? One of these must describe you.  : Oh, okay. Now we read it wrong. I read it wrong. Okay, that makes sense.

[Moderator] : Oh, was that you? You paused. There was that

[P12] : Yeah, because because I was reading a veteran who didn't receive. But this honorable discharge I didn't read that didn't in there. I'm like that doesn't make any sense.

[Moderator] : Oh, okay, got it.

[P12] : I read it incorrectly.

[Moderator] : Yep. Okay. Got it.

[P12] : See the only thing I see incorrect in here to me that maybe. Why would they put right after? You know you're finding out about eligibility where they put, you know, so you can click on to find out how to schedule a burial. They should. That should be like, I believe, at the end of this.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay.

[P12] : That to me. I mean that, because logically, you know, that doesn't make any sense to me, but you know might be must be in there for a reason.  : Oh, we have found the cemetery. You need to find the cemetery. But the Hi! There we go  : 22 years, and we want a  : oh, so I can't be buried at Arlington. Huh! Getting a predetermination doesn't guarantee you'll be buried. Yeah, this. I know that this year definitely. It's good that they put it in there, because just because you're eligible to be in a Va. That doesn't mean you can't just say I'm going to be here that they were very clear there, because at that time you die. That cemetery may be already full, or whatever.

[Moderator] : Yeah, yeah, okay.

[P12] : Yeah, that's important to put that in there.  : Yeah, sure you don't. In this you can still stipulate.  : and I'll pass your review. Blah blah  : individual ones that's good to know  : one provision. Do I need social security? A date of birth?  : Dd. 2, 14. That's good.  : Well, that's.

[Moderator] : On if you were to apply like having having that information that you just read about.

[P12] : No, this is good. So far.

[Moderator] : Okay. Good.

[P12] : Spouse. Yeah, they're not asking for anything that's not out of this world. So security. You should have that date of birth, you know, and Dd, 2, 14, or whatever. Then? Yeah, this is good.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. I'm just gonna pause you right there. So the Dd, 2 14 is that something you have easy access to.

[P12] : I had. I've never lost my Dd. To 14.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? Okay, and is that something? Have you? Do you have that digitally as well? Do you have the paper copy.

[P12] : No, I have the original original original.

[Moderator] : The original. Okay, got it.

[P12] : And I know I registered it somewhere in New York. I don't remember the exact name when I when I got when I got out when I got discharged. I don't remember, but it is. It is registered.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. Thoughts. Again. We're gonna pretend that you have not already applied. If you were to excuse me, if you were to apply  : thoughts on filling out the application here on your phone, maybe on your tablet, or would you want to do it some other way?

[P12] : That's hard because  : and I'm thinking as myself, but also as a fellow, you know, veteran, I mean, because there are a lot of people that are a little bit older. So on the phone might be the best bet with somebody there and say, Hey, this is what we need, because sometimes.  : you know, they might not have access to to a computer. They might have access. They might not even know how to use it. Like, I tell you. I'm not the best person with this. I can figure it out, but you know it's not. You know it's not something that I really I don't really enjoy it that much. Anyway, that's why I didn't even have a computer  : So they, they really make sure they keep that that 800 number open so they can still do it that way, because you don't know what everybody's situation is. Gonna be.

[Moderator] : Okay, yeah. Got it? Any? Excuse me. Any thoughts on  : potentially uploading like the the Dd 2, 14 is that are are. Is that something you've ever, not the not that particular one. But have you ever  : looked into uploading documents, or some some are getting any? Any documents into the phone or tablet.

[Moderator] : Yeah. Okay. Good.

[P12] : Yeah.

[Moderator] : Do you recall what what like, how you've done that? What methods you've used in the past.

[P12] : Well, a lot of times they'll have you know that click on which is fantastic. If not, I tried to go like on their website. And you know, it'll click it that way. So yeah, I've done that.

[Moderator] : Okay, to get to get something of your like, can you? Sorry? Can you explain that again? Going on on the website to get something.

[P12] : Yeah, sometimes they'll have like a W. You know. Www, dot, whatever web you know.com, and if you need something, then you can click it that way. You can usually find it there. But a lot of times, if it's something you need, you can always get it, you know, one of these click on, or I'll just call my daughter and say, Hey, this is what I need, and she'll say, Okay, ma, I'll get you the the link.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P12] : That's what it's called the link. And she said, I'll get to the link, and there, and you know I make them work.  : Did.

[Moderator] : Got it. Have you taken any photos of any documents? And and to to put on your phone or tablet.

[P12] : You mean a screenshot.

[Moderator] : Not a screenshot so like, maybe of your.

[P12] : Like an attachment.

[Moderator] : An an id like like, let's say you have your your a physical id taking taking a picture of that to then? Yeah, maybe to add, as an attachment to you to an email, for example.

[P12] : Yes, that I've done.

[Moderator] : Oh, you have okay. Great.  : Got it. Alright. So I am going to in just a moment. Send you another link.  : Okay? So you should get.  : Let's see if a notification comes up.  : Okay, let me have you do you know how to switch back to the zoom app from where you are right now?

[P12] : Maybe if I hit this little thing right there, wait.

[Moderator] : So it. So it's actually gonna be switching to a different application. Are you on an iphone or an android.

[P12] : An iphone.

[Moderator] : Okay. So if you with your with your finger, scroll up from the bottom and then hold.

[P12] : Up from the bottom.

[Moderator] : So from so from from the bottom of of the physical phone.  : So so you're not. So it's kinda I'm gonna do it on myself. So so if you.

[P12] : All I'm seeing is like the contact me type, information.

[Moderator] : Right? Yeah, so not not something on the website. But if you put your finger below the phone and then swipe up.

[P12] : Oh, that little line that takes it out. Oh, yeah, yeah, I can do that.

[Moderator] : Yeah. Okay, yeah, so so scroll up.

[P12] : Okay, I got it.

[Moderator] : Yeah. So yeah. So then, scroll up and hold. And you should see the other applications that are open.

[P12] : Good luck with that one. Hold on!  : I told you I'm not the best of it.

[Moderator] : That's all good. We're gonna we're gonna get through this wonder woman.

[P12] : This means.  : Hold on! I know there's a way to do it. But but that way, hold on, Elsa.

[Moderator] : Yeah, so so bring bring your finger like below, below the screen. Actually.

[P12] : Yeah, I did that, but it just put me back onto my.

[Moderator] : Okay at the at the very top. It says, zoom go back to where you just were.  : You can go back.  : I'm not sure what you'd pulled up.

[P12] : That makes 2 of us.  : And then.  : because I know there's a way that you hit it from the left, from the right bottom, and it's gonna give you everything that's open. But of course.

[Moderator] : Yeah. But here, let's  : Oh, hold on! Hold on!  : Something.  : Come in from the right or from the left, rather.

[P12] : Yeah, from the left. I saw something, too, but it doesn't wanna work when I don't want it to.

[Moderator] : So let's say let's let me let me have you take your finger and then put it in the middle of the screen and then swipe down maybe an inch or so tap in the middle of the screen. That's we don't want to move any applications. Yeah. So take your finger in the middle of the screen and then pull down, maybe like an inch or so. We're gonna get to a search.

[P12] : Join. Oh, okay, there it goes.

[Moderator] : Oh, you know

[P12] : Okay.

[Moderator] : Screen so tap that that very long link in the middle.

[P12] : Oh, whoosh! I just learned something.  : Okay. Okay, it says, Re, reply, copy or quote.

[Moderator] : No. So actually, you can just hit the the cancel button. We don't need to reply to anything.  : Yeah, so just tap in the middle of the whole mess of letters there. Yes, and.

[P12] : Still give me the same.

[Moderator] : Oh, try I think. Do hit cancel again, so do a much, a much faster tap. I think that's probably.

[P12] : Oh, there it goes! Yep.

[Moderator] : It's working, it's working. We're we're getting through.

[P12] : All right, give it just a moment to load. Okay? So now we are in a prototype. We're no longer on the website. Nothing here is real. Most of these buttons will not be working. So this is the same pre-need application that we were just talking about. Let me scroll down to the bottom. This is just showing a couple screens.

[Moderator] : And tap on the start. The Pre. Need eligibility application on the bottom. There we go. So, pretending we've jumped ahead a number of steps here. So this is what we are talking about before. About yeah, uploading  : uploading items.  : And I know you said you. You have. You have before taken pictures of some sort of like identification.

[P12] : Yes.

[Moderator] : Okay, great. Okay. So we'll actually have you scroll down.  : And I'm gonna have you tap on a little more scrolling, a little more. Yep. So the submit button on the lower right, we're gonna pretend that you have. There we go. We're pretending you have submitted  : this pre-need application on the phone. So let's say so. I know you. Of course, this is different from how you actually did it. But pretending that you did submit this on the phone. What would you be expecting in terms of any next steps after you have submitted this.

[P12] : It says your application submitted. Okay, we'll let you know your application details. My name is correct, my confirmation number, and it's telling me what I put and what is submitted. It says, print this page.  : No, I think that's fine. I don't. Yeah.

[Moderator] : Do you do you think you would print the page.

[P12] : I would do a screenshot.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?

[P12] : Yeah, I can't print it because I don't have a I don't have access to a printer. So I would do a yeah, I would do a screenshot.

[Moderator] : Okay, you take a screenshot. Okay, and then  : would you be expecting anything else in terms of any additional communication? After you got to this screen?

[P12] : Well, I would figure they would send me an email saying, You know, Sammy Smith, you know your application has been on file. Blah blah blah, and even follow it up with something in the mail.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. Mail and email, okay.  : And how about in terms of what would you want to know when when they when they did send you this email, for example.

[P12] : Well, since it's a pre-niece claim, I wouldn't let them know. Hey, you are eligible for XY. And Z, or you're not eligible, you know, for whatever.  : Denial? Or, yeah.

[Moderator] : Okay, yeah. How about if if that doesn't come back or let me rephrase this  : like, how how quickly would you. Would you expect to receive that information? They either? Yes, you're eligible or no, you're not.

[P12] : Back in the day, I would say about a week.

[Moderator] : I'll be, Yeah.

[P12] : But now you know what. But I think if if you were to be denied, I believe that right away you would get a denial.

[Moderator] : Oh, okay.

[P12] : I think you would get some kind of an email saying, Hey, you know you're denial. You can always appeal. Call this number or whatever.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? Got it? Okay? And then if let's say the the decision didn't come back right away. Would there be anything else, or or thoughts on. Yeah, thoughts on. If if you don't get an immediate, either denial or approval.

[P12] : I would in the meeting to me. I understand now that you sometimes have to wait a month for something like this. You might have to. This is me. I would. If within a month I don't receive anything. I'll you know. I'll check my email, check my spam, you know. Make sure it didn't go in the right, the wrong direction. I would call that 800 number again and say, Hey, I'm Sammy Smith.  : I filed for a pre- need on, you know. June 7, th it's been a month. This is my confirmation number. Can you just eye it and see if you see anything or you can help me somehow.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. So you said, if if you haven't heard back in about a month.

[P12] : Yeah, I would give him like a month, because I know something, for whatever reason. You know, it's yeah.

[Moderator] : And do you have anything? I guess. How? How would you know to follow up in a month? Or how would you remember to follow up in a month.

[P12] : I put it on my calendar, and I think, and I think this is important enough where people should remember. But still I put stuff on my calendar.

[Moderator] : Okay. Great.  : Okay.

[P12] : Paper, calendar.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay, good and I think I think you just said like, how how important is it to know like, where this app? What? What the status of the application is.

[P12] : It's very important, because God forbid you die a month, a day after that month you're going to need to know what it is you qualify for.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P12] : You know.

[Moderator] : Yep, got it all right, and then so let's say, we're gonna jump ahead in our in our pretend, timeline, that you then receive this Prenita letter that of course, you you already have. But  : How would you?  : Expect to receive that letter?

[P12] : I would say again an email, and you would also get a paper. But I don't. I don't know if anything is on. I don't. I have not looked in the Va. App to see if that document would be on there. I haven't even thought about looking on that.

[Moderator] : Okay, would that be something? Since you brought that up? Is that is that something you would expect or want to have on the app.

[P12] : I think now that I'm thinking about it, since we're having this conversation, it would be good to have that on. There.

[Moderator] : Okay, yeah, what would be the benefit of having it on the app.

[P12] : Well, you you've got to remember that I mean, God forbid! Something happens, and there's a fire or anything. I mean  : anything just to have it on there. Somebody could always, you know. I say, let's say my phone, for whatever reason gets messed up and there's a phone knows. I'll tell my daughter, hey? Can you, Lot? See if you can log into my into my app and pull that up? I mean, somebody else could have access to it, you know, if they need. God forbid! It's a as a  : as a precaution, you know, as a backup.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. So so you you would. You would give someone else your your login to have them to log in. Okay, got it? Other ways that you might want family members to have access besides logging into your your app or your website or your.

[P12] : I think I think that's it. Yeah, they they have my logons, anyway. So.

[Moderator] : Oh, they do. Okay, got it.  : Okay.  : And then any thoughts on  : anything you would want the Va. To do in terms of having that information available for family members.

[P12] : I'm not sure if they have. I don't remember if let's say I like like. When I used to call for stuff on my mom, I was as an authorized user.

[Moderator] : And I'm just.

[P12] : Call, and they say, Hey, this, yeah, this is us. Oh, yeah, I see you're on here. I'm authorized to speak to you. I'm not sure if they have something on there like that.

[Moderator] : Oh, okay, got it.

[P12] : Yeah. Well, this, you know, this is such and such calling for Elsa, you know, and I think that if they don't have it, that thing that would be helpful.

[Moderator] : Okay, to have some sort of authorized.

[P12] : Like an authorized user.

[Moderator] : Yeah, yeah, okay.  : Alright. Got it. And let me have you scroll down on this screen.

[P12] : Down. Okay.

[Moderator] : Sorry to go to go to the to the bottom of it.

[P12] : Oh, to go to the bottom. Okay.

[Moderator] : And then tap on the continue.

[P12] : Continue.

[Moderator] : And then we're going to go to the Pink. Go to my Va.

[P12] : Okay.

[Moderator] : Okay, so we are in a pretend account here.  : thought, we're going to jump back in the timeline of after you have applied. But we're waiting for the decision, and I know. So I know you said you would put something in your calendar after a month to check back.  : Thoughts on having some sort of status within your account here.

[P12] : Yeah, that's good. That'll be good.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay.

[P12] : Because that would go right along, because if they have a status that means once you get quality, then once you get, you know it goes through, then it should also have a, you know, saying, Hey, this is what she's eligible for.

[Moderator] : Hmm,

[P12] : So that would tie in together with what I was asking earlier.

[Moderator] : Okay, any thoughts on like, how? Well, I guess we, i'll, just confirm like, if, if those those status updates were here. Would you check them? Once a month, more, often less often. Any thoughts on that.

[P12] : I me personally, I go in there all the time. I check on my medical. I go into my veterinary. I go medication. I go into my appointments to make sure that it hasn't been canceled, because I've had appointments that have been canceled, and I have not been told anything.

[Moderator] : Oh dear!

[P12] : For what? No, it's yeah, I mean, who knows? They probably just hit the wrong button. Who knows? But I do go, and I do I? I give people the benefit of doubt. So I do go in there and check. You know every so often stuff.

[Moderator] : Okay. So so you're in here regularly, just

[P12] : Yeah. But like, I said, that doesn't mean anybody else is going to be, you know. Do it? I mean, it's it's, you know. It's hard to say.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? Yeah. So having updates here, and then, how about  : once the decision letter has arrived? So I know you talked about having it in your app?  : yeah, would you also want it? The app we're going to look at separate. This is still pretend a website here. But would you want it within here as well.

[P12] : Yeah, I would like that in here. Yes.

[Moderator] : Any thoughts on where would make sense? Or if if yeah, what what it would make sense to be with, or where you might be here, on your, on your phone, or on your profile.

[P12] : There's there's a section, and I don't remember what the title of it, but it has like the years served, and all that status, I think in there will be a good place, and I don't remember what it's called.

[Moderator] : Okay, alright. So your service got it, or you're served. Got it.

[P12] : Yeah, something like that. I remember exactly what it says. So you know, I think it's like an account account information or something. I can't remember.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay.  : got it. Got it? Okay? And you'd so you had said like, if you were to have the the decision letter within your account, you would give your family members access. Any any additional thoughts on  : getting that getting that letter to family members. Now that we're looking at this.

[P12] : No, I think that could be it that that'd be good.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it  : and let me have you scroll to the bottom. We're going to look at one more screen  : and the yellow go to Va app.  : Okay, so has. So is this, the app is what you.

[P12] : Yeah, oh, I love this app.

[Moderator] : Okay. Glad to hear that.

[P12] : This app.

[Moderator] : Got it and so now that we're looking directly at this thoughts on having the status of let's say, the pre need application here while it's still being decided.

[P12] : Yeah, because it would be I  : I would put it under. Hmm, claims.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P12] : I think claims would be the appropriate, because that is a claim you're trying to.  : I think that would be a good spot, and then, once you get approved, then you would go with says, approve of service, and put a vet up. That's what it approve of veteran status. I think that would be good if they shift it from, you know, claims once it's approved to that.

[Moderator] : Okay. So do you mean like, like with it? And and most of these buttons don't work but it like, if you were to tap on the proof of veteran status. It would be there, or just.

[P12] : Right, it'll have the yeah. The proof that you served, and also saying, this is what you're entitled to.

[Moderator] : Got it. Okay, got it. So it would be with that.

[P12] : Right

[Moderator] : All right. And let me see, yeah. And any other thoughts on on accessing that information from.

[P12] : No.

[Moderator] : Up here.

[P12] : This app is. Actually, I love this app. I actually like this, app a lot.

[Moderator] : Alright. And is this since you had mentioned you're often going online to check for like appointment stuffing is that through the app? Is that, do you remember? Is that.

[P12] : Oh, yeah, I I go strictly through the app. I love this app. This is when they came up with this, it was just like, because I used to have to go into what is my healthy bed and go in there? No, this is fantastic.

[Moderator] : Yeah, x.

[P12] : Even if I communicate because they have. Also, you're gonna you do secure messaging through here.

[Moderator] : Yep, okay, excellent.  : Alright. I believe those are all my questions. I'm just gonna check with  : Natasha, Brian and Carly. If any of you 3 have questions you're welcome to unmute and ask them. Now.  Carly: I do not have any questions, but I would just like to say that this has been very insightful and valuable just to hear your attitude and opinion on you know the general site and how you use the tools you know, use your phone, or prefer to use a different method to get what you need to get done so that it really helps us long term when designing even our our next forms and all. So we really appreciate your time. Thank you very much.

[P12] : Thank you, ma'am.

[Moderator] : Thank you.  : Okay, it doesn't look like anyone else has any other questions.  : and okay. So I just wanna so now that we've had the whole conversation. Just want to confirm again, are you still comfortable with me? Potentially using clips from this for our Va partners?

[P12] : Yes, ma'am, you could put my babbling on anytime.

[Moderator] : Excellent. All right. So, yeah, that is this for us. That is it for me. Now really appreciate your time, I mean, Carly said it all. Why, we why, we love talking to veterans. It's really very important. And yeah, just wonderful to hear from people who are going to be using things that we are designing. So thank you so much for sharing with us and giving us your time  : and prayer. Jean will be reaching out with to you with a Thank you. Note, and if you have, I think, a blurb to invite other veteran friends you may have, if they want to also want to help with research, but that is it for us, and I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.

[P12] : Okay. Now, how do I get out of here? It just zooms out.

[Moderator] : I'm gonna be ending the meeting meeting for all, so that should shut everything down.

[P12] : Okay, thank you. Thank you guys for your time.

[Moderator] : Thank you, take care!
