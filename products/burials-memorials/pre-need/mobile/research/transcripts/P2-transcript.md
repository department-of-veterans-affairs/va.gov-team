# P2

Moderator: Okay, so to confirm, are you okay if, are you comfortable with me recording as we talk today? 

P2: Yes. 

Moderator: Great, thank you. And also, would you be okay with me potentially using clips from the sessions to share with our VA partners? 

P2: Yes. 

Moderator: All right, thank you for that confirmation. Okay, now to actually talk. So to start, I'd love to know a little bit about you as a veteran. What branch of the military did you serve? And when did you retire or separate? 

P2: I was in the Air Force, and I separated in April of 1988. 

Moderator: Okay, excellent. And what sort of involvement do you have, if any, with the VA, both in the past and now? 

P2: Go to the VA regularly. I have a mental health counselor. I go there for all of my health care. 

Moderator: Okay, great. Got it. Oh, yeah, go ahead. No, okay. And do you so sorry. So you are at the VA on a regular basis, you have a counselor there. Do you do you use the website often? Do you use the app? 

P2: Yes 

Moderator: You do. Okay, both or one? 

P2: I use the app and the website. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. For what reasons do you do use either the website or the app? 

P2: I check my appointments, and I order my medications, and I look at my lab work and my diagnostic imaging results. 

Moderator: And do you know, is that all on the website? Is that all on the app? Is it a split? 

P2: Um, it's, most of it's on the, most of it's on the website. Going onto the app is usually to check, um, appointments and where the appointments are and to. 

Moderator: Okay. Is there anything else that you use the app for besides checking appointment details?  

P2: Well, let's see. Hmm. Not necessarily much more on the app. Not necessarily much more on the app. It really depends on where I'm at. Um, you know, if I, um, I'm sorry, I have a four pound dog and she runs the show. My husband is outside, so she's having a fit. 

Moderator: Oh, well, I do love at boat boat. I do love dogs. So yes. 

P2: So she'll be quiet here in a minute. So, no problem. Um, yeah, so I don't, you know, I don't, I don't think I use the app as much as I use the website. I find that, you know, once I get on there, I like to just go over every, once I get on the website, I just go over everything. Check when my next appointment is. Look at my recent blood work. Look and, um, um, you know, I just go over everything, go, just go through everything. 

Moderator: Okay, so you're reviewing various like health aspects of it, it sounds like. 

P2: Yes, and also I read the blogs. Oh, okay. Yeah, and I look and see what the discounts are for the month, you know. Okay. Yeah, so I take advantage of a lot of that. 

Moderator: Got it. Okay. And you said you don't use the app nearly as much outside of appointment details. Is there other reasons that you would go to the app besides appointment details you mentioned? 

P2: You know, I'm trying to think I've got I'm trying to think about going on the app. And just I don't think I use it. I'm just not. I don't use the app very much. I just don't.

Moderator: Any thoughts of why that might be? 

P2: Just because the website's got everything on it and you can navigate and do several things at the same time when you just get on the website. 

Moderator: Mm hmm. Okay. And when you're on the website, is that on a computer? Is that on the phone? Do you do? 

P2: Yeah, on occasion, I'll get on the desktop computer and look at the website, but usually I'm on my phone. 

Moderator: Okay, what reasons might you have to go on a computer instead of on your phone? 

P2: Um, if I want to print, well, no, I can print things off of my phone. It just, you know, really, if I'm happy to be sitting here and something comes across, I'll open up the, I'll get on the website. Or if I'm sitting here and I get an email, I'll just navigate to the website. Get an email from the VA, I'll navigate to the website from the desktop computer. No, no hard reasons. 

Moderator: Oh, okay. Got it. All right, but so it sounds like you're mostly on your phone, would that be it? 

P2: I'm mostly on my phone, yes. 

Moderator: Okay, great. So, we are going to be discussing VA benefits as they relate to burials today. So, first, before we get into that, just speaking much more broadly about benefits you are entitled to as a veteran, I know you said you do all your health care, maybe all your health care. Do you recall how you have learned about what benefits are available to you over the years?

P2: Oh, I got a letter. I'm 100% service-connected. So I got a letter and it tells you everything that you're all it tells you all of your benefits. And then as I went on the website and would look different things up. But you know, I have a military ID card, I have access to the base, I have all the benefits. 

Moderator: Okay, so you got a letter that told you what you're eligible for, and then you also found stuff online? Is that correct? 

P2: Yeah, I did. Well, for instance, my husband, we're signing my husband up for Champ VA now because he's retired. And that was something that I discovered on the website. So we, and you know, you have to download the forms and print off the forms and mail everything in. And so that was one of the specific things that I did find on the website. 

Moderator: Okay, was how, but I was regarding that form specifically. 

P2: There's a great deal of information that you have to read and it was just easier to print it off and read it. 

Moderator: Okay, so you you were you were printing what was already I just want to make sure I understand So you were you were printing information that you had found on the website you found it easier to read. 

P2: We wanted to pull it off and make sure that I had all the documentation that I needed to send him for his Champ VA because also on his signing him up for Champ VA I had to have his information and you know I don't have all of his information on my phone so it was just easier to get on the desktop computer and then I could go back and forth from his Medicare account pull everything off of there pull his social security you know pull his employee information employer information and then I was able to plug it all in and write it down and print the forms off and do everything just sitting here. 

Moderator: Good. Okay. So you were gathering everything. 

P2: Yes.

Moderator: So the form you mentioned, I'm actually not familiar with, but is that was that something? Were you able to fill out the form online or did you have to print it out? 

P2: No, you have to print it off and mail it in.

Moderator: Got it. Okay. Have you done any applications or any any forms online? 

P2: Um, I don't know that they have sent me anything that I've been able to fill out online. Like a PDF that I could edit? No. 

Moderator: Yeah, I know not everything is yet available. So, okay. So, you have to print stuff out and gather things there. So, do you recall a timeline of when you had filled this form out for your husband? 

P2: Yeah, I just filled it out about eight weeks ago. 

Moderator: Oh, okay. So this is a fairly recent thing. Got it. Okay. So you mailed, printed it out, filled it all out, gathered information, mailed it in, because that was the only option that you had. How about any, what sort of communication were you given, if any, about any next steps? This one, like I said, I'm actually not familiar with, so I don't know what any sort of next steps might be. 

P2: I'm talking about the champion with Champ VA specifically. I called them and got someone on the phone ,and they're pretty clear that they're six weeks behind. So, and then when I mailed it, I got a tracking number. So I've been tracking it. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. Okay. And where are you tracking? How does that work? 

P2: On the USDS website. 

Moderator: OK, got it. And do you know about how often you're tracking this? 

P2: Um, let's see, I mailed it off and then I tracked it. And at first I went to Denver and because they've changed the office. And so they're forwarding everything from Denver to Pennsylvania. So I was tracking it about once a week. 

Moderator: Okay. Got it. And are you sent any information about this or is this all you seeking out what the next step is like with your track? 

P2: You mail everything off and then you don't hear anything until they mail you something. They don't even let you know that they've received the package. If you don't track it, you don't know. 

Moderator: Got it. OK, thoughts on that experience, what you just mentioned, that you don't know anything unless you're tracking. 

P2: Well, if you were the kind of person that had to have up to date, you know, you needed to know what was going on. You could always pay to have them, you know, send a receipt that they had to sign for and then you would get a notification but they don't, I don't know what to tell you about that because you fill out the paperwork, you mail it and they send you something back. It's pretty clear that they're going to communicate with you yes or no and send you your packet information if you get accepted for Champ VA and you'll get an ID card. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. 

P2: And, um, and then they do tell you that when they get your packet, if you haven't sent everything in that they will communicate with you. Let you know that they need something else, but we were pretty thorough. 

Moderator: Okay. In, let's say, an ideal world, since you say you are going to the website to track it, would there be anything you would rather have VA do in terms of letting you know what the status of everything is? 

P2: Me personally, no, I'm, I'm good. I'm fit, you know, it's just, it's a process. It's like anything else though, they'll get back to me when they've made a decision. 

Moderator: Okay. Got it. What do you have? Since you said you check it about once a week. What how how 

P2: I was tracking the package about once a week to make sure that it got to its destination. Oh, it's the package. Okay, got it 

Moderator: And would you, did you have any sort of method to remind yourself to do to check out every week? 

P2: No, no. Okay. Just that my husband was asking me. And so when my husband asked me, I would look and see where the packet was. 

Moderator: Okay, got it, got it, all right. Okay, so going back to any question about benefits, I know when you had received a letter letting you know what benefits you are eligible for, you've read about things on the site. Are there any other places that you have learned about benefits in the past? 

P2: Well, Oklahoma Department of Veterans Affairs also has a website and you can go on there and, for instance, they'll mail you a, oh, there's a form, and I can't remember what the name of it is, is a 970, a 574, something like that. Our card tags are $6. So, I, you know, I learned about that on the ODVA. 

Moderator: Okay. 

P2: I did extensive research when I first got my disability benefits. I was reading everything from everywhere. 

Moderator: Oh, okay. So you just found all the information. Got it. All right. 

P2: I found all the information, but I stayed on the government websites because most of it's attorney driven and there's some false information on those websites. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. So knowing that what specific resources have you found the most helpful to make sure that you're getting the right information? 

P2: The VA websites. 

Moderator: OK directly from there. Got it. Okay, and then so we're going to go to specifically about burial benefits. Can you tell me what you currently know about burial benefits that are available to veterans? 

P2: Um, that we can go to the VA administration. And I have a local one here, less than five miles from my house, uh, tell them, you know, that the veteran has passed away and then they'll help you arrange burial, um, a burial and ceremony, and you can be buried in them. VA cemetery. And then they will come and do the flag folding and play taps. 

Moderator: Okay. Got it. Do you recall how you first learned about everything you just mentioned, where you would go directly to them? 

P2: Oh, my father is retired from the Air Force 23 years, and so this is something that I've always known about. 

Moderator: Okay, so you learn different family. Got it. Do you recall if there's been any other place you have seen any mention of the burial benefits? 

P2: Well, I do Wreaths Across America, and so, you know, that you learn about the burial benefits there. When you sign up for that, they've got information about better burial benefits on there, and not specifically, and not exactly the steps that you take, but on the VA website, if you look into your death benefits, there's an entire section that explains to you about, you know, that the VA will bury you. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. And then have you been involved in the past on, on planning anyone's funeral could be either a veteran or not a veteran? 

P2: Yes.

Moderator: Okay. Did you know ahead of time, the person's wishes? 

P2: Yes. 

Moderator: How was that set up? How had you learned about their wishes? 

P2: Well, they're very pragmatic and, and we're medical people. So we deal with death every day of our lives. And so anytime you're in that, in that situation, you, and you see people, they pass away, their family doesn't know what to do with them. They, um, or, or, or people have a tendency to do things with your body after you're gone, they, you would not have wanted them to do. So it's important to express to the people around you what you want. Even though you're dead and gone, you're not going to know the difference. It's still, um, what if you do? 

Moderator: Got it. Okay, so, all right, so they've, they have told, was there anything specific, like with, with past burials that you were, past funerals you were involved with? Was there any information you had to look up? Or was there, had there been anything written down? What was the structure of the information that you had known? 

P2: No, just every single person whose death I've been involved with, they were pretty specific about if they didn't want to have a wake, if they didn't want to have a viewing, where they wanted their funeral to take place, where they wanted to be buried. If they didn't want to be buried, that they wanted to be cremated, so there was not a lot of guesswork. 

Moderator: Okay, great. Would have had people written things down for you? Is this all conversations? 

P2: Conversations. I've never had anything in writing. 

Moderator: Oh, okay. Got it. 

P2: I think my husband might have something in writing and have expressed wishes in writing because we've had, we have a trust and wills. So we, you know, you write those things down when you do a trust about how you want your death to be handled. 

Moderator: Okay. Well, that was leading into my next question was, yeah, what sort of thinking or planning you've done for your own wishes? 

P2: That

Moderator: Okay. 

P2: And I've expressed to everyone what my desires are. 

Moderator: Okay, good. And so do you have things? I know you mentioned that you've got a trust set up. Do you have things written down?

P2: In the trust. In the trust. In the trust. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. Do you recall, was there anything specific that prompted you to start laying out what exactly you would want? 

P2: Birthdays. 

Moderator: Ah, interesting, okay. 

P2: Yeah, I mean, the older you get, the closer you are to dying, so you have to start planning and thinking about these things. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm, all right. 

P2: So, and I mean, we've had people in our family that have passed away and loved ones that have passed away. And so, you know, you want, you want to have your affairs in order because you don't want to leave anybody with a mess because trying to make a decision during the grieving process is almost impossible. And you want to make things easy on people that you love. You don't want, you want them to concentrate on getting over the fact that you're gone, not trying to take care of business. 

Moderator: And you said so, so birthdays had prompted you. 

P2: Mm-hmm. 

Moderator: You recall, like, what, do you recall what it was their one particular birthday that stuck out? 

P2: I’m getting older and and going to do will do will my husband has a trust. We have a trust. I have a trust and then we have all we have wills and so when you're going to put something in your trust or your will you gotta sit down and think about it and how you want it to be worded because you know this gets passed on to your executor and it's their job to make sure that your wishes are carried out. 

Moderator: Mm hmm. Okay, got it. So everything is written in the trust and set for, for whoever is is will be will be working through through this. Okay, got it. So now we're going to discuss the specific benefit to veterans, the the pre need burial benefits. First, are you familiar with that benefit specifically? 

P2: Pre-need burial benefit?

Moderator: Yes. 

P2: Um, no, not, not as worded. No. 

Moderator: Okay. Can you say more about, you said, not as worded, is there something similar you're thinking of that you might be familiar with? 

P2: Well, I wouldn't. I wouldn't look it up as a pre-need burial benefit. I would just look at my burial benefits. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. Yeah. So as you can probably guess what it is, it's something you would fill out to find out if you are eligible to be buried in a VA National Cemetery, if that's something you choose to do, called a pre-need burial because it is before the time of need as funeral homes. 

P2: Okay, gotcha. Okay. 

Moderator: So you said if you were looking up something like that, you would look up burial benefits. Are there other ways that you think might be more clear, I guess, if you're going to be looking up something like that? 

P2: No, I think the, you know, the less words, the better. Burial benefits. Veteran burial benefits would cover it for me. 

Moderator: Uh-huh. OK got it. 

P2: Because I would feel like if I were looking for my veteran burial benefits that everything should be in there. 

Moderator: Uh-huh. Okay, got it. And if you were, let's say, interested in being buried in a VA cemetery, what information might you want to know? What do you think will be important to you? 

P2: Who I need to contact. The contact information, contact numbers, you know, any way to contact someone concerning being buried in the VA cemetery. 

Moderator: Okay, so just like a step by step that sounds like just okay makes sense. 

P2: Because, you know, you need someone to either probably most people are going to need someone to help them coordinate that. 

Moderator: Okay. So with this form, after you do apply, you'll receive one of two decisions, pretty straightforward:
A. You are eligible to be buried in a VA cemetery, 
B. You are not eligible to be buried in a cemetery. 

So going back to our discussion on the various forms you have filled out and waiting for information, what would be important to you once you received this decision, for lack of a better word, on, let's say, you know, you are eligible, you've been told that, what would be important to you in terms of what to do with that information? 

P2: Well, you need a step by step. You know, what's the, what's the first thing that you need to do? What's the second thing that you need to do? You need direction and guidance. 

Moderator: Okay. Yep. So with the, um, okay. So yeah. So, so guidance, it, it, it would, um, with this decision, it's generally a letter really of, uh, yes, or like, yes, you're eligible. Um, thoughts on what you might want to do with that letter, for example. 

P2: Well, myself, it would have to be part of my trust, part of my trust, part of my will. And then also, I think that a copy of those things need to go to your surviving family members and, you know, people that are going to be, that are going to be handling your business after you're gone. So, you know, I would make multiple copies of that so that everybody had the same information. 

Moderator: Okay, you would you send copies to everyone got it any thoughts on would there be anything that you would want the VA to do in order to help facilitate that? 

P2: Are you talking about what I want the VA to send the letters? What would I want? 

Moderator: Yeah. So let's like, let's say you've received this letter saying you are eligible. You've already stated you would make copies and send them to everybody. Would there be, in addition to that, would there be anything that you might want the VA to do to help in that manner in any way? 

P2: Well, I would think that at that point in time, the VA's job is to be informative. You know, how many veterans, how many veterans cemeteries are there where you're close, that are close to you? I just, I think that at their point, at that point in time, their job, the VA's job was, would be to give you all the information. I don't know that they need to step in and do anything.

Moderator: Okay. 

P2: Unless you're dealing with someone, a widow, and she's 95 years old and her husband's a hundred and he just died and she has no one to help her there. You know, that may be a situation where she said, where she says, you know, I have no assistance. Who can I contact for assistance? 

Moderator: Hmm. And is that something you would think the VA could assist with? 

P2: Well, I would hope so, or send her somewhere, you know, like I know where my local VA administration is, but everyone's not very good at sharing information. So the more information, the better, you know, if this, if this person needs to know where is the local VA administration, who can I go and have a sit down face to face conversation with, because, you know, people over a certain age, and some people, period, are not going to be computer literate enough to be able to navigate their way through a website, they may not even know how to get to the website. 

Moderator: Yeah. So, okay, so you'd want you want them to potentially assist, especially if people are not able to you are, you know, for some reason, not able to use the website. 

P2: Right. I mean, you can inundate people with information and they not read it. That's on them. I mean, we can't hold everyone's hand. And, you know, we can't force people to take care of themselves or to take care of their business. So, you know, you have to draw the line somewhere. 

Moderator: Okay, got it, got it. Okay, so I am going to send you a link in just a moment. Okay. Oops, sorry, I'm just bringing it up on my screen. Oh, yeah, actually, first, we're going to do some screen sharing. So do you know how to share your screen on your Zoom app? 

P2: Let me see if I might be able to. 

Moderator: If not, I can help. Let's see. 

P2: OK, you're going to have to help me because I don't have any icons. 

Moderator: Okay, so if you just tap once on the screen, there should be... Got it. Okay, on the bottom, I think if you scroll... Yes, share. Okay, share screen. Yes, I'll share the screen. 

P2: Got it.

Moderator: And then I think it'll give you an option that says, I think it should say like start broadcast, something like that. 

P2: Got it. 

Moderator: Okay, and then it usually takes like three or four seconds. Yep, there we go, perfect. Okay, so you can just tap anywhere outside of that. Yep, perfect. We're done. All right, now I'm going to send you a link. So yeah, at the very bottom where it says Emily to meeting. So this is going to be the VA Burial Benefit site. 

P2: Got it. Okay. 

Moderator: Maybe you've already gone here before. So now, so I know we've talked about you've gone here. Let's say you were... Go back to the discussion of, let's say you were interested in looking information on planning or preparing for your own burial. You thought that just burial benefits would make more sense than the pre-need burial we talked about. Would there be other... Now that we're on this page, can you think of other information that would be important to make sure that you have? If you're looking for planning information. 

P2: Other than these four categories? 

Moderator: Yeah, or maybe if this is sufficient, then that's fine too. 

P2: I think this looks sufficient from scrolling down underneath each category. You know, I do have, I do have a question. Is there anything on here that covers if the service member no longer has possession of their dress blues? Is there anything on here that covers them having a military uniform that they could be buried in? 

Moderator: Okay. Well, I don't know the answer to that, but it sounds like that's something you would want to know, just what happens if they don't have their uniform anymore. 

P2: Right. It says replace medals, awards and decorations. Um, you know, that is something that multiple people like to be married and married and buried in their dress blues. But you know, sometimes their dress blues are moth eaten and not serviceable. And you know, that's, it's a sort of surprise pride for a veteran. You don't want to be buried in your moth eaten dress blues. 

Moderator: Yeah, yeah. Okay, so you'd want that discussed somewhere in here. 

P2: Yeah, I would just like, I'd like to know if that's, if that is covered, that if someone needs, you know, what, once we would like to be buried in there in a military uniform and have their medals and decorations and honors affixed to it. Okay. 

Moderator: Yep. All right. You want to know all that. Other information you might be looking for when looking to plan to prepare for your own burial? 

P2: Oh, also, does it cover a hearse? Does it cover taking you? Do they come and pick you up? Because all of that is something that you have to pay for. You know, mortuary, if you die at home, they have to come and get you, they have to hold you, then they have to prepare you, and then they, you know, transport you to the grave. And, you know, is all of that cost covered? 

Moderator: Okay. So what cost recovered sounds like? Okay. Got it. Can you think of other... I know there's a lot here, so we certainly don't need to read everything, but other questions off the top of your head that are coming that... 

P2: Well, you know, they charge you to dig the hole, they're opening the grave, they charge you to uncover it, they charge you to lower you down, they charge you to cover it back up. So and then after that, once you're in, once you once you're buried, I think the VA takes care of all the maintenance of those areas, don't they? And that and that's something that the government takes care of maintaining the lawn, maintaining cemeteries. 

Moderator: I will say I don't know, but it also sounds like that's important for you to know. I'm just making note of that. Okay. Got it. So let's say we're going to say that you do plan on applying for the pre-need burial eligibility. Can you walk me through like a rough

P2: Cancel. Okay. Sorry. Thank goodness this is not a functioning website because I highlighted a number and I wanted to call it. 

Moderator: Oh, yeah, so I should have said this. My apologies for not saying it. We are actually on the real VA.gov website. I apologize. That was my fault. 

P2: That's okay. 

Moderator: So let's say we're going to pretend that you have chosen to apply for the pre-need burial eligibility. I'm not going to have you actually apply. I'm not going to have you enter in any information. But can you walk me through what steps you might be taking from here? 

P2: Okay. So there's, I see that there's a beneficiary financial counseling and online will preparation. Oh, this says if you're enrolled in VA life insurance. Hmm. Okay. Other benefits and services. I'm too far down. Um, so you want to know, like, the first, I'm burying a veteran. What the first, for which one of these I would look at first? 

Moderator: No, if you are looking to prepare for your own burial and you've decided to do the pre-need burial benefit, what information, where you might go here. 

P2: Um, plan a burial, schedule a burial for a veteran or family member. Pre need burial eligibility determination. Well, I guess that surely to God, I've got a DD-214 and an honorable discharge and I'm, um, so, um, do I really need to find out if I'm qualified, do I need to go through that step? What, um, I mean, I would assume that I have to go through this step. 

Moderator: Oh, got it. What information might you want to know if that is actually necessary? Since you said you already know that you have an honorable discharge? 

P2: Well, I would think that that would that may be a question, but they could go to eligibility. 

Moderator: So, okay, got it. Let me tap on the pre-need burial eligibility determination. And again, I'm not gonna have you fill anything out here, not even gonna have you sign in, nothing like that. So we've gotten to this page. Thoughts on preparing to even do so. Actually, let me back up. Since you said, why would I even need to do this? Does this page answer? Does this page give you adequate information to tell you why you might actually want to do this? 

P2: Well, it does. This is one of these must describe you. So the patient, the veteran didn't receive an honorable discharge. The the better service members passed away. Don't dependent child of a service member if you aren't married. Okay. Okay. So whether or not you qualify burial and being a cemetery on your service history, sponsoring your application of various best friends, best or unmarried child. Okay. So in other words, this is making me think that everyone needs a pre-need letter. Okay. Because the only reason not if a service member dies on active duty, they're eligible for burial without a pre need decision letter. So it sounds to me like this is something that you need to put in place before you pass away. 

Moderator: Mmhmm. 

P2: You know, actually a veteran who didn't, actually, you know, this is making me question this. Okay, so it only gives three instances to find, okay, find out if you're eligible. One of these must describe you.

A veteran who didn't receive, who didn't receive a dishonorable discharge when you separated from the military. A veteran who didn't receive a dishonorable discharge. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. 

P2: So that means everybody else is eligible to fill out a pre-need letter. Okay, that's kind of, you know, double talk. 

Moderator: Okay, how would be a more clear way so that yeah, you wouldn't have to read it multiple times over. 

P2: A veteran who didn't receive a dishonorable, and I know that there's multiple types of discharges. So why can't they just say if you received a dishonorable discharge, you're not eligible? Why can't they just say that right off the bat? 

Moderator: Okay, so you would you would prefer to know that right away and then yeah 

P2: Yeah and then any other in any other discharge categories or I can't remember what the wording is on my DD form 214 I'd have to pull that up here but um you know I think it might even say type of discharge I'm gonna look in my documents um so yeah here's my DD form 214 right here okay where does it say that I was a good girl for six years um okay character of service okay so a veteran who didn't receive a dishonorable discharge when you separated from the military so you know why can't they just use the same wording, veteran who whose um character of service was honorable is eligible

Moderator: Okay. 

P2: All other character of service, discharge, I'm trying to think how that could be worded so that it wasn't so confusing. 

Moderator: That's fine. I think overall the big takeaway is this is not clear. 

P2: Not clear. No. Not clear. 

Moderator: Okay, yeah, that's fine. We'll move on from there because yeah, it is it is word a little a little oddly so uh Okay. So going back to so you're saying at the beginning, you know, why would I why would I have to fill this out? I already know I have an honorable discharge Does this does this good do an okay job of explaining why you would need to fill this out or why it would be helpful to fill us out

P2: Well, actually, now that we're looking at this, I did not realize that this is something that I probably need to handle beforehand. And then this coming on down, it says you'll need to contact the cemetery about their pre-need program. Some VA grant funded cemeteries require that you live in that state or have eligibility rules.

Moderator: Do you feel the information here outside of the unclear part that we've already discussed and I know you're not going to I'm not going to read everything because it is a lot but does it does it look like this is providing all the information that you would want to know? 

P2: Um, Oh, I love this. We don't take reservations at the VA National Cemetery. You said you did. Okay. We asked where you prefer to be buried. So we try to help with all your final wishes. Boy, how does that make sense to fill out the application? Let's see this applying. We'll have to find supporting documents. We need to make sure you can get us to apply the best way we can be. Okay. Are you still there? 

P2: Yep. I'm here. 

Moderator: Okay. Sorry. I heard a beep, beep, beep like my phone and I have on you. Okay. I'm looking, I'm all I'm down to what information do I need to apply? Yeah. Okay. So also, um, getting a hold of someone's DD form 214, you know, actually this is very important information on here because everyone doesn't have their DD form 214. And you know, the state of Oklahoma is apparently very good at getting those back to you, but I, you know, I know that there's instances where other people have had difficulty getting like their father's DD form 214 when they're trying to get their mother nursing home assistance. 

Moderator: Oh, OK, yep. Got it. So if you were to apply now that you've seen what you need, it sounds like you already have access to your DD214. 

P2: Several copies. 

Moderator: Okay, so you are you are very prepared excellent 

P2: But it does say find out how to request the DD Form 214 on here. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. 

P2: So. 

Moderator: Any thoughts on the clarity of what's listed here in order to apply? Will there be more information that would be useful to you? 

P2: Well, it says you'll also need supporting documents showing you have the authority to apply for that person. Okay, appointment of veteran service organizations, claimant's representative. So there's some forms to download on here that you have to fill out that say, in other words, that you have the right to make decisions for the decedent. 

Moderator: Yeah. 

P2: Okay, but they gave you two choices. Okay. Appointment of veteran service organizations, claimant service organization, appointment of individual as claimant's representative. Appointment of veteran service organization. So that's maybe if that is, if you're in a VA home, you would be considered a service organization, but you as an individual have claimed. Okay. 

Moderator: Would there be, I'm just going to pause you right there, do you have a sense of how easy or difficult it might be to gather all this required information that you're reading about? 

P2: Um, well, it's pre-need determination available. Wow. There is all, there are lots of forms from your name, phone number, email address, and blog. Say my dad, my dad, he doesn't have an email address 33 B in the form and provide your name, address, phone number, and email address and blocks. Provide supporting documents can show why the person applying can't sign because they're dead. Provide supporting documents that show your relationship to the person applying. Okay. And then you mail this in. Don't send the originals of the DD form 214 and the supporting documents since we can't return them, send copies only, fax your application. This is what you want me to do, right? You want me to continue looking at this and

Moderator: I'm actually going to pause you right there. So now that you've seen there's a few different ways that you can apply to it. You've read about the facts, the mailing, and then online. Do you have a sense of what you might prefer, like what method you might use to fill out the application? 

P2: This, if you continue on down, it says get help filling out an application, which that should be up front. I mean, really, that, quite frankly, get help, that should be the very first thing they offer you. Okay, because this is, you know, I'm scrolling down through here. And I read everything. Okay, I've read this previously. But there are a lot of words on here. And if you're scrolling down here, through here, I mean, I've tapped my screen, what, seven, eight, nine, ten times before I get to get help. And that should be the very first thing they offer you the very first thing they offer you is get help filling out these applications. 

Moderator 
Okay, so you got it. All right. Thoughts on if you would prefer to, let's pretend you don't need help at the moment, but would you would do you think you would fill it out? Excuse me, mail in the application, fax application, do it online. Do you have a sense of what you might prefer? 

P2: Myself? 

Moderator: Yeah. 

P2: I would try to do it online. 

Moderator: Okay. Got it. All right. So I'm going to send you, um, copy this link. I'm going to send you another link and this will actually be a prototype. So, um, can you switch back to your Zoom app? 

P2: Okay, I'm headed back there. Okay. 

Moderator 
Yep. So that very long link right there. Tap on that. OK. And that can open up a prototype. It'll be just a moment. Sometimes it's a bit slow. There we go. All right. So this is so again, we are in prototype mode now. Nothing, nothing will basically nothing will work. But, 

P2: OK

Moderator: So this is a representation of what the actual application for the pre need is going to or does look like I've only included a few screens in here because it is it has actually multiple screens long. But maybe you tap on the the bottom part versus start the pre need eligibility application. 

P2: OK

Moderator: So there's there's only a few screens in here and it's it's already filled out part of it. Scroll down and tap the continue button. 

P2: OK, 

Moderator: There we go. And then once more, again, we're pretending you've already filled out your basic information, so scroll down all the scroll down to to continue. 

P2: OK

Moderator: OK, so we're going to pause here and talk about the the supporting files. I know we've talked about the DD214 and it's on the list. I'm going to say there was a Social Security card and there I actually never get what what else there was. But thoughts on oh, you know, one thing I didn't ask and I apologize if you were going to fill this out and you said you would want to do it online. Do you have a sense of view if you would prefer to do it on your on your mobile phone or on a computer? 

P2: Well, I would prefer to do it on the desktop. 

Moderator: Okay. Can you tell me why that is? 

P2: Well, because then I can save it to my documents.

Moderator: Oh, okay. 

P2: Because I'm not very good at saving things to my phone in a file and then being able to go back and locate them right away. But if I did this on a desktop computer, I could put them in a folder or save them to my desktop and they'd be easily accessible. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. So when you say saving it, can you say more about that? Like what exactly you are saving and then returning to? 

P2: I would screen save these things as I filled them out. And then, you know, I just create a file that would look exactly like what would be printed off. 

Moderator: Oh, got it. Okay, got it. All right. So this actually is a form that you can fill out directly online. There's actually no need to print something out. So it is different from the other form that you've mentioned. In case that changes things. 

P2: I would probably print it anyway. 

Moderator: Oh, okay. You would print it anyway. Got it. Can you tell me why that is, as opposed to filling everything out online? 

P2: If my desktop computer was to crash, I've got nothing. 

Moderator: Okay, so you're worried about losing information? 

P2: Oh, I'm not worried about it. It happens. 

Moderator: Technology does fail. I will definitely attest to that. Okay, it's a fact. You're, yes, you're not wrong. It is a fact. All right. 

P2: But if my house burns down, I lose my papers too, so there you go. 

Moderator: What do you do? You know, it's you can't be 100% anywhere. 

P2: Cannot get away from these disasters. 

Moderator: You really can't. Yes, I agree. So with this particular one, because you would be logging into your account, you wouldn't actually lose anything, even if, let's say, you lost your email, for example.

P2: Got it. I hear you. 

Moderator: So if that... Does that change anything in terms of if you prefer a desktop as opposed to your mobile phone? 

P2: Um, me, okay. I've got a couple of things to say about that. So I can use my mobile phone. My father doesn't have any fingerprints because he's, he was, um, he was on [REDACTED] and he's got [REDACTED]. He can't navigate a phone. 

Moderator: Darn it. 

P2: My husband doesn't have a lot of feeling in the tips of his fingers. He has, he has a difficult time navigating the face of his phone. I don't have any trouble, but someone who does, they would have a difficult time filling all of this out on their phone. 

Moderator: Okay. That makes sense. Got it. Specifically regarding gathering the documentation on your phone. We're going to look at this screen right here. It could be outside the VA, but have you done any sort of either application or form where you have had to upload anything? 

P2: Oh, yeah. Yeah, you know, we have to follow visas to go to different countries. Yes, we and also my husband just went on Medicare January the 1st – Excuse me. He retired January the 1st And so he just we've been signing him up for Medicare B signing him up for Tampa VA signing him up for health care signing him up for Cobra because there was he had an interesting He has an interesting so security card history, so we've uploaded a lot of documentation.

Moderator: Okay, got it. And how are you like, what device are you using to do all this uploading? 

P2: We have a printer, scanner, fax machine at the moment. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. Have you done any uploading of files from your phone with anything in the past?

P2: Yes. 

Moderator: You have? Okay. 

P2: Yes, I have. 

Moderator: Okay. Thoughts on potentially doing that here within this application, on the fake application? 

P2: Yeah, I have. Do I tap on upload file and see what it looks like? 

Moderator: That won't actually work, so this is more of just a physical activity. 

P2: You know, is it gonna allow me to pull it from my, is it gonna give me a choice to pull it from my photos, to pull it where? 

Moderator: Would that would that be what you'd want to pull it from your photos? 

P2: Well, it would depend on where I had it stored on my phone. 

Moderator: OK. 

P2: You know, or, you know, what if I don't remember where I have a sort of my phone? Is it going to have a search feature? You don't want to search for. 

Moderator: Got it. 

P2: You know what I mean? Because what if I do this now and then I die in 40 years and I'm old and I can't remember where I stored this on my phone. 

Moderator: Right, right. Okay. Got it. How about if you let's say like taking taking a picture of a document. Have you have you done that with any? 

P2: Oh yeah, I have everything on my phone. 

Moderator: Okay, so you're very familiar with that. Got it. Yeah. How about how about that? Since you mentioned it might be difficult to. 

P2: Well you know photos are fine. But, you know, here recently, I had a lot of things get sent to the cloud. And you know, I don't really pull things. I've never pulled anything back from the cloud. So 

Moderator: Okay. Let me have you click on the submit button that's on the lower right-hand side. I'm just going to pretend you have already filled out the application. Congratulations. And so just a couple of questions here, because I know we are almost out of time. So after, you did fill out the application online. What might you want to know in terms of any next steps that might be happening after this? 

P2: Okay, once you send online and fill it in, it would be nice to get a response back that they've received it. And then also, you know, just just for continuity. You know, if, if they've received it, to let you know, you know, we need more information, you've sent it, they don't need to say you've sent enough information. But if they, if you need more information, they're, you know, they need a way. And I know it's said it asked earlier for your phone number and your email address and everything. But I hope that there's a way that you can preference how you want to be contacted. 

Moderator: Okay, so you'd want to tell them how to send you the information? 

P2: Yes. Also, you know, for like, for my dad, he can't hear I do all of his business. 

Moderator: Oh, got it. Okay. 

P2: Everybody calls me. And so, you know, that's not necessarily his phone, his phone number that he puts on there. Sometimes mine. And I don't know, I think that that's something I really, honestly, across the board, and everything that needs to be something that needs to be addressed, because more and more people are handling their their elderly, or people who are incapable of doing business over the phone. And, you know, that, there needs to be a, oh, my brain's not working this morning. There needs to be a way that that's word is like, like, call, this is my phone number. Yes. My home phone number, but this is the preferred phone number. 

Moderator: Oh, I see. Yeah. 

P2: Oh, good. And who that person is, you

Moderator: OK. Yep, no, that totally makes sense. So when you, so I noticed that you would want confirmation from the VA that they've received this, that you would want them to tell you.

P2: Yeah. Yeah, that they received it. Yeah because, you know, I've, I've missed put phone numbers in before and got messages back from people that said, you inadvertently have sent me something. And if someone sent me something and I've had to contact them and say, I received something and I do not think that I'm supposed to. 

Moderator: Yeah, that's, I've had the same thing as well. Okay, so you'd want to hear information from the, from the VA, I forget if you already said how exactly you would want them to notify you that- 

P2: Well, what- your preferred means of notifications. Do they need to call you? Like my dad's got a flip phone, he wouldn't know how to get a text message, but they would need to call me. Or they need to email me. They need to use my information. And I know that you can just put my email address down on there, but... 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. 

P2: Um, 

Moderator: Okay. Would there be anything within either the app or your profile on the website that you would want to find this information, like the confirmation that you said, or if they, if you need to include additional information 

P2: On the form? 

Moderator: Sorry, not informed, like within.  

P2: Ask me that question again. I'm sorry.

Moderator: I didn't word that well. So let's say so again, we you have already, you have already applied, and you already said you would want them to give you confirmation somehow. My follow up question to that is, would there be any place else that you would expect to to see that information with without them, let's say texting or calling or emailing you as something within your account? 

P2: Oh, like if I was on my account on the, on the app or on my account on the website? Ooh, that'd be nice because then you wouldn't have to go back and forth looking for things because like I told you, when I'm on my, when I'm on the website, I, I just, I look at everything. Yeah. Okay. See if anything's changed, if there's any new information. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. Okay, got it. 

P2: For instance, my husband was not in there as my emergency contact, and I have tried to get that changed now for two years. And all of a sudden the other day when I was checking it, there is name is as my emergency contact. 

Moderator: I'm glad it worked eventually. 

P2: Finally, that took a minute. Yeah, I'm not kidding. Even at the desk at the front desk every time I go to the doctor. I have some things on it as my emergency contact. They're like, it is on our records. 

Moderator: Okay, well I'm glad it finally got there. Okay, so one more question and then I will let you go because we are and I do apologize.Once this application has gone through, it's been decided, you will receive a letter. So we did already talk about you would print out this letter and give it to everybody, put in your trust and everything. 

P2: Yes, that's important. 

Moderator: Yes, I agree. 

P2: Would there be any place would you would you also want that to have it also want to have that that decision letter somewhere within your account as well, just like we talked about. 

P2: That would be important. Okay. 

Moderator: Yes. Got it. 

P2: It would be important. 

Moderator: Do you think both the app and the website, I know you said you only use the app occasionally for appointments.

P2: I think that it would be, I think, why can't it just be posted everywhere? Because, you know, like, if you're, if you're searching for help, and, you know, you may be may have not been married to this veteran for very long, and you're at the VA administration, looking for some help, but he was, he was proactive. And he's done all of this paperwork. And you're sitting in front of the, the administration, the VA person, he goes, Oh, yes, right here, he's already filled out his pre need eligibility letter, everything's right here. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. 

P2: So this information, if it's done, it should be easy to find. Easy to find. I like that. No one's going to have to go looking for it. 

Moderator: Yeah. Okay. Got it. Great. All right. We are over time. So I'm going to end us right there. Thank you so much for everything, [REDACTED]. This is super helpful. It's always important to hear directly from veterans exactly what their experiences are. So thank you for taking the time and helping us make, slowly make these products better for you.

P2: All right. Well, thank you. And I hope it was helpful. 

Moderator: It was very helpful. Alright, have a great day. 

P2: You too. Bye bye. 

Moderator: Bye.
