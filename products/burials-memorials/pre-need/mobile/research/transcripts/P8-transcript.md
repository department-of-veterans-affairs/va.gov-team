Moderator: 8, 2. Alright. So to confirm, are you okay with us recording today?

P8: Yes.

Moderator: Okay, great. And are you okay? If we use any clips to show our Va partners? Okay, great.

P8: Yes.

Moderator: Okay. Now here we go. So first, st love to know just a little bit about you as a veteran, what branch of the military you served, and when you retired or separated.

P8: Okay. Separated in [REDACTED] 91 after desert storm from the Us. Air Force.

Moderator: Okay, great and tell me a bit about your like, how you are involved with the Va. Both in the past. And now.

P8: Me. Well, I actually started my benefits since 1992, not being aware that I was entitled to, I just was curious, and so I went in, and from then on it all started.

Moderator: Hmm, okay. So you said you went in. So sounds like you have been to some of the facilities.

P8: Oh, yeah.

Moderator: Okay, great and.

P8: 92, that is.

Moderator: Good. Okay, great and are you? Current are currently using the website or the app of the Va for anything.

P8: Yes, yes.

Moderator: Okay. Overall. What what sort of things are you using either of them for?

P8: My healthy vet I usually check my regular benefits, my prescriptions, X-rays labs, and so on.

Moderator: Okay, good. And is that all on the website is that what? Which part is? What sorry.

P8: Yeah, that's a Va app that they have. Does it designated for that.

Moderator: Is it? Okay on the app? Got it? So do you use the the website at all? Or do you just just use the app. the website as well on my computer. Okay, got it all right.

P8: Would be only on the phone and the tablet when I have a chance. I usually check it out once in a while, but I, normally, when I want like to print out benefit letters and so on. I, I use the computer.

Moderator: Oh, okay, got it. And can you tell me why you choose to use the computer as opposed to? Your phone for something like that?

P8: I feel more relaxed.

Moderator: Where was that? Oh, okay.

P8: Yeah.

Moderator: Got it. Do you know why? Why, you might feel, let's say, less relaxed on. If you're if you're on the phone.

P8: Not actually less relaxed. But since you know all I it's like when I want to take a peek if any prescription is coming in, and if I have any appointments coming around, and so on. Just for small peaks. I usually I usually check on it often.

Moderator: Oh, oh, you're you're checking on on prescriptions and stuff often. Oh, yeah. Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

P8: And my appointments.

Moderator: Okay, got it. And and all of that is on the app. Got it? Okay? Got it? Alright. Great. Okay. So since we you started to lead into my next question about benefits. You said you didn't know about what you're entitled to right away. Can you tell me? How did you come to know.

P8: Right away when I was discharged in 91. I basically not that I'm native from [REDACTED], but I ended up moving to [REDACTED] after I was discharged in 91. So I was, like, you know, like trying to get a job. And one of those things I actually found out is that I could probably have a chance of having medical benefits in the Va. Because I was honorably discharged, and so on. And so I just went on, and everything went ahead. After that. I applied for compensation because of the conditions, and so on. And that's where it all started in 92 approximately.

Moderator: Okay and and sorry I missed. How? How like? Where? Where? Exactly you you 1st learned about what? What you were eligible for.

P8: Where, in in a country or.

Moderator: Or is there like? Was it from a person? Did you read about it?

P8: No, I just I just. I was just curious and found out nobody. Actually. because I we I was married. I had kids and so on. I just happened to find out and on my own, and I just went in the the clinic where I went to, and and I submitted what I needed to, and that's when it all started.

Moderator: Okay, got it? And and how about now? Are there? Are you? Are there other places that you're learning about? Current benefits that you're entitled to.

P8: Yes, yeah, every day. There's something new to look at.

Moderator: Oh, okay, where? Where? Where are you looking at that? To find find that information.

P8: Oh, basically. I just I go through. well, I have an advocate which is through the Va. Itself. here in the county that I live in. and I go to my medical appointments in [REDACTED], Pennsylvania. So here and there, when when you basically like, you wait for your appointments or go to schedule appointments. Well, you actually, you know like. Look around and see things that are posted on the walls, and you know.

Moderator: Okay. So so, more, more. So in person, as you're as you're in the places. Okay? Got it, got it all right. and specifically for benefits related to burials. Are you aware of what I guess? What do you know about it? And do you recall how you 1st learned about them?

P8: Okay. I understand that there is a national cemetery which I would not hesitate on choosing at the time that my time comes. I've advised my wife about it. and she knows by all means here than Pennsylvania there that I would like to be when my time comes. You know. other than that. I know that there's a national cemetery. I'm not totally aware if, I would need to do that, how much time ahead of my time and so on. You know that those things you know they still exist. Those questions are in the air like, I say, but you know it's not. It's not that I'm not saying that I'm going to die anytime soon. God forbid! Because then you know, the longer the better.

Moderator: The longer the better. Here you go.

P8: So, you know there's a time to enjoy everything.

Moderator: Okay. And do you? Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

P8: No, no, no.

Moderator: Okay, do you recall? So I know you said like, when you go in for for appointments, you're seeing lots of information about other benefits. Do you recall ever seeing anything about burial benefits in those places, or have you? Have you come across the information anywhere.

P8: I think once or twice I've seen something, but I haven't like been after it, or. like, you know, like to go into any particular office like to say this. I would like this I would desire when my time comes, and so on. I haven't done that yet.

Moderator: Okay, got it? Got it? Alright.

P8: I've been advised to do so, but.

Moderator: Oh, got it! Alright! All right, we'll we'll we'll get to that part at this point. Have you been involved in the planning of anyone else's funeral before.

P8: Yes, I have.

Moderator: Okay? And did you know, ahead of time, the deceased wishes.

P8: not really, but in my experience and in this life I've I've seen people that they desire like like a special song, like some kind of music if they were like some kind of something to be remembered for, and stuff like that.

Moderator: Hmm, okay, got it. And so with with the stuff you just mentioned. Was that was that communicated verbally. Was anything written down? How? How did you come to know that.

P8: No something that I actually saw in regards to where I've been.

Moderator: That you saw

P8: And participated, and so on.

Moderator: Okay, got it?

P8: We.

Moderator: So since you brought up starting to thinking and or planning. So first, st have you done any any thoughts you said you had looked at or noticed a particular cemetery. But yeah, tell me about what your thoughts, if any, or planning you've done at this point for your for your own burial or funeral.

P8: Not much, because I'm totally looking to see if I can find out more information. Of course. About that in regards to that. But like I say, it's something like normally for me, for instance, I would not. It's not that I'm afraid of anything, but you know it's not. It's good to have it and know about it. When you have a loved one that lives with you. And so they could be aware as the same. My wife knows, that she has a I have my benefits and everything, and I assume that you would know to go to the Va. Office here, where I'm at right now and get like let's say, the flag. I it's gonna be if I'm going to have a cast message in our cast.

Moderator: Scan, or like earn.

P8: No, the cask, the casket, that's what they call it. the box, the the box that they put people in.

Moderator: Yeah, yeah, casket.

P8: Yeah, yeah, she I'm trying to, because we she's been married with me. I was divorced, and she I got married back in May of last year.

Moderator: Hmm.

P8: So I'm trying to get her you know, up to date, and things that she should know.

Moderator: Hmm, okay. So so when you say, get it up to date, do you have things written? Is this verbal communication.

P8: Verbal verbal, basically, yeah, making her aware.

Moderator: Yeah, okay, got it? So at this point, do you have anything written down? Anywhere, in terms of any, any wishes.

P8: No like I say, like I say, I have.

Moderator: Oh! Oh! You! You!

P8: Yeah, I think I think I have a document somewhere in the house.

Moderator: Okay, got it? Okay. And have you been? Have you communicated with with anyone else?

P8: Right, yeah.

Moderator: Yes, Andrew.

P8: My sense.

Moderator: Okay, got it. Okay, so we're going to be discussing a specific benefit of the va the pre- need burial benefit. So first, st have you heard of it? Are you aware of what it is? Okay. So what it is? So the the term pre-need comes from the funeral home industry. And it's literally means before your time of need, time of need being when you have died. and it is a an application you fill out to determine if you are eligible to be buried in a National Va cemetery. it's something you fill out. They go through the process of determining, and then send you a letter either. Yes, you are eligible or no, you are not eligible, and now that I've explained it, have you? Does that sound familiar at all? Had you heard it mentioned anywhere. No, okay. Got it all right. Now that I've explained a little bit of it. Thoughts on does. How does that sound to you. How does it sound useful, interesting? Any any thoughts that come up with that.

P8: Yeah, I'm interested in all has to do particularly with you. Have a handicap. really? Oh, excuse me, this lady wants to get on my case because she's handicapped, and I'm on my handicap. Go on, column. Go on! Got him! The people are starting to have some so so annoying, you know. Medicula.

Moderator: It.

P8: Redicula de la.

Moderator: Are. They are things. Okay. Do you need to.

P8: Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, no. She even said she was gonna call the cops on on the you know.

Moderator: Oh, okay. Oh, goodness.

P8: I have my, I have my, my plate, and everything.

Moderator: Oh, okay.

P8: Don't respect, don't respect privacy.

Moderator: Ryan. Okay. Well, hope hope everything is okay.

P8: I'm good. Thank you.

Moderator: All right. Okay. So back to back to pre-need can you? Can you say more about what? You know? Why, why, you might find that that interesting or useful.

P8: The me know in there the that this is available.

Moderator: Yeah, yeah, or just the the.

P8: It would be very easy for my family to cope with at the time that it's needed. And hopefully before then I'll be making sure that I I had the opportunity to you know, to make things easy for them as well as for me.

Moderator: Okay. Got it. Think of? Oh, sorry. Go ahead. Can you think of any any questions you might want answered like specific information you might be looking for in regards to the pre-need eligibility.

P8: Well, as far as I'm well informed of what I need to do. I would be good to to start off with that. To to be doing things, you know, in in time.

Moderator: Yeah, okay.

P8: Okay.

Moderator: It. Okay? And so I know you said you've there is a document in your house regarding regarding the wishes. Any further thoughts like specific sorry, specifically, with this pre- need. Well, there will be a decision. Letter. Thoughts on what you would want to do with this letter once once it is, once it hit, it has arrived.

P8: Once it's formalized and everything, you know. Hopefully, I'll get it to everyone. And it needs to be. I got to. Yeah. My sons, and have a copy in the house for my wife.

Moderator: In the house and the family members. Okay? And then any thoughts on, if there would be anything that the Va. Could do to make things easier in terms of getting that information to your loved ones.

P8: Of course I will appreciate that. Oh, yes.

Moderator: Okay.

P8: If there's any. If there's any way that it could be done, you know I would be willing to do whenever ever needs to be be done.

Moderator: Okay.

P8: Order to get it, you know.

Moderator: Okay, any thoughts on specifically what you might want the Va. To do in order to to make things easier for your family.

P8: Basically like, you know, if there's a way that I can, they can actually call my sons at least so they could rest assure here here. Hopefully. Personally, here, living in Pennsylvania with my wife, there shouldn't be no problem with that.

Moderator: Okay, got it.

P8: Yeah.

Moderator: Okay. So, stepping away from that for just a moment, have you filled out any forms through the Va.

P8: For that! No, no.

Moderator: Okay? Oh, sorry, not not just for that, but really could be for for any any kind of.

P8: Yeah, I have.

Moderator: Yeah, okay, got it? Do you has have they been online? Have they been on paper? Do you recall how you filled them out.

P8: Both.

Moderator: Okay, got it? For ones that are online. Do? Do you do them more on your desktop, more on your cell phone.

P8: Computer.

Moderator: On the computer.

P8: Yeah, because if I would need to like, have a copy of the whatever form I have like the in regards to anything I would like to keep in my files. It's better that way.

Moderator: Oh, okay.

P8: For me, that is.

Moderator: Get it alright. And and how is how is it better? Can you say more about that?

P8: Oh, I'm just doing okay. It's as long as I can rest assure having something that I could look at at a later time. Perhaps you know, to show someone if I needed to. Or take along with me that's that's the part

Moderator: Okay. So for for actually filling out the form, just the the application. So it was that you would still prefer to do on the computer.

P8: Yeah.

Moderator: Or, yeah.

P8: I would do that. I would do it if I got it mailed out to me that that would be fine as well I would be. I like to do things like that, you know. Although I have a little difficulty right now, like writing using my hand to write. But still, you know, I try to do things, you know. I try to take pleasure on what I do.

Moderator: Yeah, okay, got it.

P8: I like to. I'm not a perfectionist. But yeah, I'm seeking. I'm seeking actually to be one someday. Well.

Moderator: Got it. Have you do you recall? If you have filled out any forms on your cell phone. it could be with.

P8: Once in a while.

Moderator: Once in a while. Okay. do you? Any any thoughts? Or what would you say? The biggest differences are between when you're filling out forms on your phone versus filling out forms on the computer.

P8: No reason being that I fill the forms on the computer is that I have a copy for me of what I've done.

Moderator: Oh! Saving, so.

P8: Yeah, cause. Yeah, cause sometimes I have a chance to. But for whatever reason I lose, sometimes I have lost a document on the phone. And I don't wanna go through that, you know, less less frustrating for at least for me. That's happened with me, with my emails, for whatever reason they disappear and.

Moderator: Oh, okay, so that that doesn't happen as often on your computer.

P8: No, because I keep it on my hard drive, and you know.

Moderator: Got it.

P8: Or if I need to, just look it up and print it, if I need to. Well. Yeah.

Moderator: Okay. So with forms that you've filled out through the Va. What has been your experience after you've completed it in regards to whatever next steps might be coming in in terms of communication, or what like? What? What has happened after you filled out the form.

P8: Okay, the the deal is that I can rest assured that everything went through. And and with some, most likely I'll get an email, some type of confirmation that it's been done, anything besides the point being needed, you know, I'll be hopefully called upon or emailed or text. You know. That would be something nice, you know, to always have in in mind.

Moderator: Okay, so just a confirmation that it got to where it had to go. Okay, got it? And how about any sort of updates about I the status of whatever you had just filled out it. Like, let's say, there's a longer timeline before the next step happens.

P8: I usually try to have more patient than needed, you know, cause I understand I would not be the only one in line with the request.

Moderator: And also.

P8: So basically, you know, I'll wait, you know, and I'll just call once in a while to file to find out the status.

Moderator: Hmm, okay.

P8: You know that would be something I would be doing all the time. I'm very persistent on things I do, and I keep on. Try to keep on track as well.

Moderator: Okay, do you have a sense of how often you would call in to check up on something.

P8: Depending how urgent or how important it would be for me.

Moderator: Hmm, okay. Got it.

P8: How would you? Which would? I'm sorry there, which would have been the the deadline of any of me turning in any documents and stuff like that, you know, in order to not to put any stress on me, of course, but.

Moderator: Yeah.

P8: It's basically to follow up on whatever's needed if needed.

Moderator: And do you have any system to keep track of that? In in terms of when you might want to next, check up and and call whoever you're calling.

P8: Yes, yes, I normally keep the numbers and any messages that I could try to keep. I take a picture on my phone. If it's on my phone so I can have it handy. And you know. things like that.

Moderator: Yeah, okay, so.

P8: That's why I prefer to have a doc, a printed document, so I can keep, and my files whenever I need them.

Moderator: Okay, get it. And with something jumping back to the the pre- need. If you let's say you would be applying for the pre-need eligibility. Thoughts on how important that would be in terms of finding out next steps like if if there, if there was a long wait. For example.

P8: I would I would be highly interested in what needing would be needed to do in time, in time being, you know. not waiting for leaving anything for nobody else anybody else to do. You know, when I'm you know, why not do it now that I'm here, you know, and take care of those matters now. because I had an experience with my parents. They both passed, and they were. I was with them until the very end, and and then we had to go to a lawyer because the deed of the house or not was not presented in regards to who's going to be the for the inheritance, and so on, and things that we can do. If there are any any other children or whatnot you know that might be showing up, you know, somewhere, and then they never. They never set that. They never set that up, and I would not ever want to go through anything like what we went, as you know, surviving children after they passed. Yeah, yeah. I would make sure that everything, if there's anything having to be known before the time, you know, although death is something very unpredicted, you know that it's always, if you have a chance to do it. You know why not do it before anything. only God only God knows, of course. But God forbid! Anything happens, and people have to. Oh, well, he didn't do that, and so on, because, even though I passed, I could have to blame for whatever.

Moderator: -

P8: Because I didn't do, and so on. Because that happens, I've seen it in movies. I've seen it in real life. Oh, yeah.

Moderator: Yeah. So you you mentioned like, after your parents passed you, you saw that you you realized oh, I don't want to put my family through. This was, do you recall was that the 1st time you had that thought about making sure that it was okay. So it was seeing your parents passing. Okay.

P8: Because I had. Personally, I had to deal with everything. Yeah, my sister, my sibling was, you know, one of those out there. One of these, anyway.

Moderator: Okay, got it. Okay? So we're gonna move to some screen sharing. Do you know how to do the screen share on your zoom app.

P8: I think so. We can try.

Moderator: All right. So yeah, if you just tap on it should should be at the bottom. Should be a little share thing. Go, share a button rather.

P8: Screen sharing. Yup. Okay, you want me with the one with the arrow.

Moderator: I think. Yes, I think there is. It's it's such a.

P8: No, that's a share like to share with somebody else.

Moderator: Oh, oh, I see. Yeah, yeah, there should be, I think. Does it? Say screen? I I thought it said, share, actually try, try, share, see what see what happens.

P8: Shares like. It's the same symbol that you see when you're gonna show you when you're gonna share like like an email or something like that.

Moderator: Right, at least on it does so. It does say that I never connected that. But you're absolutely right, but it that that should be the button, the little box with the arrow going up.

P8: So it should be so. You want me to touch that now.

Moderator: Yep, tap that, and then.

P8: Can see screen photos. So screen.

Moderator: Want to share a screen.

P8: I got you, okay.

Moderator: And then it should be a should be a start broadcast. See what you're seeing.

P8: You want me to play push, start.

Moderator: Yep, the start, and then I think we'll do a little countdown. There we go, all right, perfect. And so you can just tap anywhere outside of that center black box. There. Perfect. Alright, we have. We have gotten that all right. I'm going to send you a link.

P8: Yes, ma'am.

Moderator: Moment this is gonna come up in the the zoom chat. Okay? So right at the bottom, Emily, to meeting group so you can tap on that, and that's just going to open the browser of the Va.

P8: One moment.

Moderator: So yeah, so we're so we're on the the actual website. But I'm not going to have you sign in or fill out any information.

P8: All right.

Moderator: Just to facilitate the conversation.

P8: Okay.

Moderator: Yeah, just look at. Yeah. So this is the burial benefits. As you can see, I'm not going to read everything, because there is quite a lot of information. But we're going to pretend that you are like right now, you are potentially are looking to see about preparing for your own burial. Skim through this page, and just see what information you might be looking for, like what questions you might want to have answered answered. As you're looking through this.

P8: Okay, one that really okay, basically like, let's say, that's in like in a good order, like, you would need to know if you're eligible, which what I would understand if you qualify because of the honors you got when you separated, not medals, and nothing. But you know, mainly because you were honorably discharged to start off with. and then the pre-needed eligibility, anyway eligible.

Moderator: It is documents.

P8: Can be. You know that that would be done when you like. Want to submit the paperwork whatnot and the allowance. I didn't know there was some kind of allowance there to help pay for a veteran's funeral services. I didn't know that which is interesting for me, and of course those are left behind benefits for the local or yeah, the headstone. I'm I'm aware of the headstone. There's like a marker, and probably perhaps a flag and stuff like that because I used to be a chaplain assistant in the army, and before I went into the Air Force.

Moderator: Oh, okay.

P8: And you know I'm more or less know more like that goes. I was able to arrange a funeral service, and so on. So in reference to that of what I recall. You know I would be alert for that.

Moderator: And.

P8: Come schedule burial for veteran. That would be something for my wife, at least for her to know, at least my children. The cemetery. I'm not. I'm not fully aware of where would the closest would be for me here. I understand that I have my original 2 14 in my house. It's in my files.

Moderator: Okay.

P8: And

Moderator: So thoughts. I know there's a lot of information, but.

P8: Yeah, there is. There is.

Moderator: Yes, I won't have you read. Yeah, I know there's lots. But just from your super brief. Look here, does it seem like, does this seem like it would answer any questions you have. Does it look clear, is it? Look not clear.

P8: For the for what I see, as I see it pretty much. If there would be any other questions, I would make sure I get in touch with the appropriate person or people. Yeah, cause I see that's just a matter of taking a little time and go over. It's not a subject that everybody wants to talk about. But.

Moderator: Yeah. okay, got it. So for jumping back to one of my 1st questions, I just wanna make make sure when you're like reading and researching something. Is that something you you ever do on the phone? Or do you mostly do it on your computer?

P8: Yeah.

Moderator: Sorry on the, on the phone, or on the computer.

P8: My computer.

Moderator: On the computer. Okay? Got it. Okay? So we're gonna pretend that you are going to apply for the pre- need burial that we have mentioned. Walk me through what? From here, where you might go, what what you would be, what you'd be, what your thought process was on like how easy or difficult it might be.

P8: Well, if I would try to at least hear that in the county that I live there's a Va. Office, and I would probably go in there and ask to see what they know about. If not, I would end up going to the Va Hospital to see if they have any office pertaining to this subject.

Moderator: Hmm, okay, good. So you you go talk to folks in person.

P8: Yeah.

Moderator: Okay, so let's say you've we're pretending that you you have already talked to them. And then you want to actually fill out the application from from here. Can you walk me through what you'd be thinking into in terms of next steps for filling out that application.

P8: Well, since I have an appointment on Monday, I'll probably look into that real quick, or if I since I'm closer to the office here that I was talking to you about. I'll probably take a peek in there to see what they know about it, and probably started from there. Cause that's always been something that I've had in in the back of my mind. Of course, you know.

Moderator: Hmm, okay.

P8: So I would. I would look into that pretty soon, and I've tried. I've tried, you know. I've tried to like to go into some some kind of program that they have here locally when a funeral home. But I've always been a little skeptic on that, you know. They I don't want to fall into any kind of scam or whatnot, you know.

Moderator: Oh! Is that?

P8: Because I know. Huh?

Moderator: Oh, I was just gonna ask you to to say say more about that.

P8: Then I've been a little skeptic on going into a funeral home and to see what they have to offer for veterans or how would they probably have one? Any what type of of services they might have, or what cost, and so on. I've tried to do that, but I've haven't have not had the opportunity to succeed in it. If I'm not mistaken. About a couple of months ago. pro, probably at the beginning of the year. We had some people, I mean a lady. Go to the church and advise us about that, and I actually filled out a form she never call back or anything, and I probably perhaps I perhaps, was the only one. Probably she was waiting for more people to fill out more papers for her to take and call. She never ended up calling me so.

Moderator: Hmm, okay. Got it. Okay, excuse me. So do you. Since you mentioned a few times you would. You would go into a place to for information on the pre- need? Do you think you you would ever fill out the form on your own, or do you, or do you generally prefer to talk to someone 1st about it?

P8: No, I would probably fill it out on my own, and and as well talk to someone, you know.

Moderator: Okay, got it. Let me have you tap on the the pre- need. Burial, eligibility, determination. Here.

P8: Where.

Moderator: And under the the the get veteran benefits, the yeah. A few, a few below the 5 stars.

P8: Okay.

Moderator: Pre. Need, bery.

P8: Indian Burial.

Moderator: Yeah, let me have you tap on that. And again, I'm not going to have you type anything in. I promise.

P8: Okay, you can apply and find out in advance. If you can be buried, international yep

Moderator: Is there any thoughts on how clear or not clear this introduction.

P8: What it says. Okay.

Moderator: Is it? Is it? Do you? Do you feel like this? This answers basic question on what? Yeah. Okay? Great.

P8: Yeah, of course,

Moderator: And if you were let's we're gonna pretend that you are going to be filling it out. Let me know your thoughts on how how easy or difficult it looks in order to actually fill it out in terms of what you might need to do. So.

P8: Well, I by all means could rest assured that I was honorable this church to start off with, and you know I would go further, knowing that by all means not going like to, you know, like be on the guessing part of whatever things we do in life, because by all means. If you need to do something such as this, you need to be sure of what you're doing. So you know why. Go and have somebody's time be wasted, and even yours as well, you know, and if you know by all means you might not qualify because of the of the ineligibility you might have because of the discharge you got when you got up.

Moderator: Okay.

P8: In a veteran's case.

Moderator: Yeah, yeah. Okay. So you know, you are. You had an honorable discharge. Any any other thoughts in terms of preparing to fill this out.

P8: Well, by and if I haven't talked, I mean said anything before I would take my wife so she would be there as well. She would be a witness of whatever would be done in that day that I go in and do so.

Moderator: Oh, to so to to fill this out like at at 11 location. Okay.

P8: Yeah, yeah, we will both go. I mean, anyway, we end up going any everywhere. So there shouldn't be no problem with that. So she, she should be aware.

Moderator: Yeah, okay. Would. Do you think you you would ever fill this out? At home? Let's say, without without going into.

P8: There could be a good possibility of doing so. Yes.

Moderator: Okay, got it. If you want to scroll down a little more, just to see any further thoughts. On preparing to do this again, how easy or difficult it looks to do so.

P8: It's telling me here the the doubt I had in which cemetery I would be. but it all depends how much people before I end up going whatever. At least I would have a I have a glance of where the locations near.

Moderator: If I haven't relocated. Of course you know it all depends on that, and I understand that this is specifying.

P8: That there's there could be one or 2, probably more cemeteries that wouldn't apply for soldiers, and of Airmen's Home Cemetery, and if there would be any other than this in Arlington National Cemetery directly. and there's a way to contact, and so on, going on the web, or I don't know if they have a phone. That's something, Arlington. I really don't know where that would be that and.

Moderator: Okay? And how about? And if you want to scroll down to see under the the supporting documents that step 3 thoughts on gathering, gathering information in order to do that. How how easy or difficult that might be.

P8: Just letting me know that if there's anything other than the basic paperwork, I assume that would be needed, I would be told, and the way things will be looked at quicker, and to find to finalize any decision to be made. that that someone would be calling me up or emailing me whatnot, and not even know.

Moderator: Okay.

P8: And and not only includes me, and it includes any person that would apply.

Moderator: Yeah, okay, got it.

P8: Although I have a question, I don't know if it's out of the subject. Would my wife be qualifiable for that as well.

Moderator: I know their spouses can apply. I don't know about eligibility, but yeah, their family members can can apply that. That includes your spouse. So the the bottom of that page where it says, what information do I need to apply? Can you scroll? Yeah, scroll that. And just look at the list here, and and let me know thoughts on how easy or difficult it would be to. I know you had mentioned that you have your Dd. 2 14. At home, I think you said in in a file. I want to say.

P8: Yeah. Yes.

Moderator: Is that is that something that you, you would be able to to include from from the phone thoughts on. If you were to fill up.

P8: Yes.

Moderator: Yeah.

P8: Yes, take a picture, and send it as a How do you call that.

Moderator: Jpeg, or picture? Yeah.

P8: Yeah, yeah, I I there's some other word for that. But I don't remember. Now.

Moderator: Oh, oh! There's a number, a number, a number of.

P8: It's like a little paper clip thing that you actually attachment attachment.

Moderator: Oh, attachment. Yes, okay, yes. Got it. Okay. I'm gonna send you another link which should open up in the zoom app, and you may get the notification, or if not, if you can switch back to the zoom app.

P8: The zoom, now.

Moderator: Yeah, if you could. Switch yeah, there we go. So that very, that very long.

P8: Oops. I went too far.

Moderator: I'm not sure what we're on now. Okay, scroll. Yeah. So.

P8: This one.

Moderator: Yep. Yep.

P8: This one.

Moderator: So yep. So the bottom link the very long link that starts with figma.com if you can tap. and that's gonna get you to a prototype. Give just a moment and gonna ask some of the other questions. Okay, here. So oh, you can tap the little tiny little opt out on the lower left. either that or the little X. Yeah, there we go. Perfect. Okay, so this is a prototype. Not much is going to be working. This is just a couple screens from the actual pre-need application. So have you tap on the start. The pre-kneed eligibility application at the bottom there, and we're jumping ahead many steps. We're pretending that you've already filled out much of the form on your phone. we've gotten to this. And so so actually, this, this you've already discussed that you have. You can take a picture of the Dd 2, 14, and then up.

P8: Yeah.

Moderator: So great. So scroll down a little more, and there's a i think it says, Submit, yeah. So submit at the bottom, right there tap on that. Okay? So we are pretending that you have finished the application. We're going to stay on this page just for a moment. Thoughts on what you would any next steps you would want from here. Now that you've just finished filling out the application.

P8: And nothing right there is giving me, not acknowledging that I could print the page for records with a specific confirmation number. and the form that was submitted, the date and the name. Of course that would be me hopefully, God willing.

Moderator: Those are the things I like, because I used to be.

P8: Okay. I used to be clerical in many ways when I was a chaplain. That's only back then, and when I had my formal job in [REDACTED], where I used to be a service rep so pretty much, you know. I like to handle things the way they are supposed to be handled.

Moderator: Hmm, okay, got it. And so what would there be? Would would there be anything else that you might expect in terms of next steps after after you have filled out the application.

P8: Basically be patient. Of course, you know, acknowledging there are other people like me submitting the application. And we reviewed the way things go, and there could be possible waiting time, waiting days, waiting weeks, waiting months, hopefully, not hopefully. Not a year. That will be too much.

Moderator: Okay, so you would want to know just how long to wait.

P8: Yeah, yeah, perhaps you know, perhaps you know not not to not to be like, has it? Not been able to. you know, like to lose the interest of anything, you know, you know, would be like a a good time, you know, for decent, a decent time to wait for the response of this.

Moderator: Hmm, okay. Got it.

P8: And would there be

Moderator: Anything you might want from the Va. In terms of any sort of communication. Before the next step.

P8: Which one the one actually waiting for the response.

Moderator: Yeah, yeah, like, yeah, waiting.

P8: At least at least some kind of text or or email, letting me know that the application was admitted and that they're working on it. At least, you know, giving me hopes that everything has been processed the way it was supposed to, and you know, giving me hopes on whatever comes after.

Moderator: Okay, and how important would that communication be to you?

P8: Very very important.

Moderator: Very important, all right.

P8: Mary.

Moderator: Great. Okay? And so we're going to now pretend that the decision has been your. The application has been finalized. They have determined you are eligible to be buried in a national cemetery. Talk to me about how you would expect to be notified that the decision has been made that this has been finished.

P8: By mail email. Well, either either of those.

Moderator: Okay, and then what would you be doing with that information? Either if it came by mail or email.

P8: Our way as soon as I would, I would be notifying my sons of what I did, and things that are be to to be expected in regards to that application. And looking forward to know more about the subject, you know, so they could be on on top of whatever, and you know.

Moderator: Okay, and so outside of receiving an email and something like something through the physical mail, would there be any other place that you would want to be able to access the that decision.

P8: I could be. There's a good chance of me looking into email.

Moderator: Okay.

P8: You know that like, if I had to like, look into the actual, perhaps in the the document, the documentations of or the copies of the application, and so on, that I would need to look into.

Moderator: And so I'm sorry, that would be through through your email, or through something else, I missed that.

P8: Email email or you know, whatever happens. First, st if I get them in the mail you know just keep them on hand and

Moderator: Okay? And then any any further thoughts on communication you might want, or communication and or help from the Va. That you might want in terms of that that decision, especially for for other people.

P8: Yes, well, definitely, I would be one of the I mean, it's not because I got it for myself, but I'll be hopefully promoting anything having to do with veterans as I am, you know as well I'll be one of the promoters letting people know what's what's available for them, because I've had opportunity to see even homeless guys that have been honorable being honorable with an honorable discharge, they they better. They'd end up. They ended up being buried in the National cemetery as well because of the honors. They had an unfortunate way of of being delivered there, but at least you know they they would be able to re rest. The A Christian way of being buried, you know.

Moderator: Okay, got it? Let me have you tap on the continue. Button on the bottom gonna look at a cut and then tap on the go to my Va, the pink button at the top. So we're gonna pretend is. Is is this a page you've seen on the web.

P8: Yes.

Moderator: Okay. Cool.

P8: Yes.

Moderator: Thoughts on learning either learning the status. Yeah, we'll start there. So learning the status, would that be something you might expect to find here after you've applied. But before the decision has been made, thought so.

P8: I would assume the it's. It's a good possibility, because here's what I mainly see. Everything, mostly.

Moderator: Okay. So is, is this generally where where you go when you log.

P8: Yes.

Moderator: Okay.

P8: Definitely, I would be inclined, more inclined to look here and to look any other place, you know. Cause I you know I understand that it would be the right spot to to put this information, because that would pertain for me through the process I went through, even to get into this page. At the beginning when it 1st started. You know that's everything is right there in order.

Moderator: Everything's here. Got it? Okay? And would that be both for status update and for final letter? Got it? You would. Look here, okay, great scroll all the way down. Let me get to. I'm gonna get you to one more screen all the way down to the bottom and the the yellow go to Va app. Alright. We're gonna pretend that you are on the app now. So same question would would the app be a place that you might look for.

P8: Guys.

Moderator: Let's say status where? Where do you think you might be looking? Let's say, for be.

P8: Where would I look at? To be honest? The only place I look the most other than my appointments and my claims? Anything having to do with my benefits any updates or whatnot they would be there.

Moderator: Okay, you would, you would. But I'd be printing my letters, and any documents would be there. And I use this page a lot. Oh, you do. Okay. Got it.

P8: Oh yes!

Moderator: Okay, so and and are you, are you often pulling up letters? Under.

P8: Upon request. I usually I usually check if there's any updates on anything, you know, just, you know. maybe habits are developed.

Moderator: Okay, got it? And then, any now that we've looked at both the my Va and the website. And on the app, any further thoughts on getting that the that decision letter to your loved ones? In in regard to it, it being in your app now, or or that you're.

P8: Yes, definitely, that would be good.

Moderator: Okay, and any thoughts of how you might want to do that, or or how how you'd want that to be facilitated.

P8: It could probably be sent to them personally to their address.

Moderator: Okay.

P8: Everything you know, everything having to do with my sons is in in the Va. System. So, and I also have a cousin that lives in Louisiana hers. Her information is there? So it would be nice if there's no trouble with that. That would be all right to do for me. I would be, I would be feeling nice and good to know that they they would would be able to get, because they're pre-authorized. In anyways, you know. they're the closest that I have other than my wife.

Moderator: Okay, got it. Got it? Okay? And it sounds like you. You would. You would want also that final decision letter along like with along with your other letters. Okay, got it. You'd want all those together.

P8: Yeah.

Moderator: Okay, got it. And those are all my questions, Natasha and Natalie. If either of you have any questions here, you can unmute and ask them now. just some last have. And okay, looks like, no. So is there anything else that you would like to share regarding burial benefits that we have not gone over today.

P8: All, I think is you guys, for letting me know the latest on this at least, making me acknowledge there's something out there for us veterans. Even at our last moment, you know, and when we need it, you know that's that's the best of all. Thank God Almighty that there's, you know, we're at least what we did was not in vain. You know we did it for our country, and at least you know the honors are still there for us.

Moderator: Yeah, yeah, excellent. All right.

P8: And I just wanna confirm once more. Now that we've gone through the whole conversation are, are you still comfortable with us? Potentially using clips from this session for our Va, okay, great. Of course, I would be happy to help in a way, in any help I can probably provide. Yeah.

Moderator: Great appreciate. Well, this is has been very, very enlightening. It's always good to talk directly with veterans about their experiences. So thank you for taking the time, and it looks like there wasn't any other trouble with you with your parking situation, so.

P8: I don't know.

Moderator: That.

P8: They don't really pretty much. They don't have nothing else to do but bother. I mean, she saw that I was here in the car. I mean.

Moderator: Yeah, yeah, so.

P8: You know, knocking on the window. She you know it was her. It was her nerves, not mine.

Moderator: Okay, yeah. Well, you certainly handled it. Well, so well, thank you so much. I know Paris is gonna be.
