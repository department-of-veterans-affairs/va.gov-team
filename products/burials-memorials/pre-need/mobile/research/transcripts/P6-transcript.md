# P6

Moderator: Okay, so to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? 

P6: That's fine.

Moderator: Great, thank you. And also, are you okay if we potentially use any clips from this to share with our VA partners? 

P6: That's fine. 

Moderator: Okay, thank you very much. So first, I'd love to know just a tiny bit about yourself as a veteran, what branch the military did you serve and when did you retire or separate?

P6: I was in the Air Force from 1977 to 1982. I worked in the missile field.

Moderator: Great, and how about any involvement you have with the VA, both past and now? How, if at all, are you involved with them?

P6: Um, well, they do my medical care, um, um, and what else I'm a VAVS representative for the DAV. Um, so I work with [REDACTED]. Um, and that's about it.

Moderator: Great, great. So you do have your medical through there. So I'm assuming you've been to their facilities then? I assume that's 

P6: Yes

Moderator: Okay, good. How about using the website or the app?

P6: Not the app, but the website, yes.

Moderator: Okay, great, and what do you use the website for?

P6: Um, boy, all kinds of things, but I use, I use my healthy vet, which is going away. Um, but I use VA.gov for, um, various things. I'm also a [REDACTED] for the VA. So I do a lot of stuff to help other people get the benefits. VA.gov for that too.

Moderator: Mm hmm. OK, got it. And when you are on the website, are you more often on a desktop computer or more often on your phone?

P6: Desktop computer, or laptop, yeah.

Moderator: Got it. Are you ever on your phone for anything on the VA website?

P6: Rarely, because it eats up so much memory that I, yeah, I don't have a fancy phone.

Moderator: All right, got it.

P6: I have a few apps on my phone as possible.

Moderator: Okay. All right. So generally, don't use things in your phone for that. Have there ever been any reasons that you can recall that you have got onto the VA website on your phone? 

P6: Never. 

Moderator: Never? Okay. Easy enough. Great. So first, so speaking pretty broadly about benefits through the VA, can you tell me how you originally learned about what you are entitled to?

P6: Um, that's an interesting question. Um, I've been, I, this might be too long, but, um, I'm in the era, that's invisible, basically. And when I got out of the service, they told us a little bit about, you know, that we had housing benefits and, and, but it was, it was just, um, not a lot said, you know, I think we were handed some books or something. Um, and then fast forward to 2010. And I was, um, I was in school and I hurt myself and, excuse me. And they, um, Oh my goodness. Sorry. And, and the one, I went to the, the, um, school hospital or clinic or whatever. And, and the one gal there, she said, you're a veteran, you should check out and see if the VA will, um, if, if you can go there and get some medical care. Cause we didn't, we were [REDACTED]. We didn't have any medical insurance or anything. Didn't have a way to really pay for all the things. And so that's how I found out about the VA medical care.

I didn't even know that I was entitled. Um, we were, um, like I said, kind of invisible. That era is, it hasn't been until recently that, that even Congress has recognized it as a, as a, um, as a, uh, you know, an era that, that should be allowed, um, to be allowed into the VFW or the American Legion or any of that. It's been an invisible era. Um, it's during the cold war, but you know, nobody recognized it as war times, so I guess we were in the, I don't know.

Moderator: Okay, there'll be like no no act of conflict. I'm assuming that's well

P6: Grenade happened during my time there. But but the Cold War was still going on. Right. No one really recognized it at that

Moderator: Okay, got it, got it. Okay, so you weren't didn't we learn much at that point someone told you in 2010. How about, how about since then, how, how have you learned about what you are entitled to..

P6: A lot of it's been through DAV, they've been really helpful. That's probably the biggest one is DAV and research, you know, a little bit of research here and there and honestly helping other people, doing research for other people more so than myself.

Moderator: So okay. And are you, are you having people locally or is it a national? Who are you?

P6: I am a local for here in our area. Okay, good. And then I'm [REDACTED], I help them get all their paperwork together and then I send it to the National Service Officer up in [REDACTED]. 

Moderator: Oh, okay, got it, okay.

P6: So they have it there and then they help the people from there.

Moderator: Mm-hmm, okay. What, so you've learned about a lot of resources, learned through the DAV. Are there other resources that have been helpful in terms of learning about your benefits?

P6: Nah not really. No.

Moderator: All right. How about any barriers specific, sorry, benefits specific to burials? How have you learned about what is available there?

P6: I learned a lot when my dad died, because he was a Korean war vet. So I learned, I should say a little, not a lot, but I learned from the, the, what's he called the, the funeral guy, you know, at the, you know, at the mortuary, I learned from them about kind of some of the steps that need to need to happen. And then that's really about it. I mean, well, and I, I think I've talked to some of the people at the National Center, the state cemetery. That's okay.

Moderator: Well, in what context were you talking to the people at the state cemetery?

P6: Well, I was I was there and also the chaplain for the envy for the state. So and so I just kind of talk just learning about, you know, kind of just about what it's what it's about or how to, you know, how people go about the process, you know, but I didn't. It was a very, very short, you know, brief conversation. So I try I try to lean on, you know, as many conversations as I have.

Moderator: Have there been any places that you would have liked to have seen burial benefits mentioned?

P6: Um, it would have been nice from the beginning, you know, to know that kind of stuff. But you know, when you're in your twenties and thirties, that's the last thing you want to think about, you know, it's just, but, um, so, but it was, um, you know, it's, when you're young, you just don't want to think about dying and, um, and so I, you know, I, I'm sure I've brushed things off over the years, just like, yeah, this is not cool.

But then when your parents start dying, it's like, okay, yeah, we better think about this. And I've been through both sides of, of somebody being prepared and somebody not being prepared and it's nicer for the people left behind if you are prepared.

Moderator: That leads me directly to my next question of like you're reading my mind. I'd love to know like how you've been involved in the planning of anyone's funeral in the past.

P6: My dad, my dad was very unexpected. And there were there were no directives. There were no, there wasn't even a will, I don't believe. Okay. It was, it was, it was an experience that I've never been through before. And it was, it was just, I guess, you don't know if it's wrong or right, if you're going through it, and you've never been through it before.

But fast forward a few years from there. It was so well, let me back up. Sorry. So anyway, my brother and I and my dad's wife, we sat down and we had to, you know, sit there and go go through, okay, do you want this, do you want this, you know, this and this and this and all these, you know, things that happen with with funerals. And, and then you fast forward a few years and my husband's father passed away. And he had done pre planning. I mean, he had pre purchased a lot. He wasn't a veteran, but he had purchased a lot he had, he had planned the entire ceremony, you know, everything was, was pre planned. He even picked out the little, the little cards, you know, that you get that have the pictures on them and and and what what casket he wanted, you know, everything was out. So all we had to do was go down there and just do the final couple of steps in, you know, to finish the process of the of the funeral. And it was the contrast of my father and my father in law are night and day. And, you know, when you're under stress, and you got to make all those decisions. And it's, it's pretty challenging. Yeah, yeah. So having it all done is just really nice. Yeah.

Moderator: Yeah, so when your father-in-law passed, did you both know where to look or what the next step was?

P6: Oh, he had it all set up at the certain mortuary. I mean, it was, yeah, it was, it was all done. I think he even had his own flower arrangement picked out. So when you talk about a done deal, it was super, super easy.

Moderator: Yeah, got it. So you knew you just had to call to call them.

P6: Yes.

Moderator: OK.

P6: Got it. My brother-in-law was, he was the executor. He kind of, you know, he kind of controlled the whole thing, but it was just nice to sit down and talk about the program. That's about all we did. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. And then how about any thinking or planning you have done for your own wishes? Tell me about how you started thinking, what sort of planning, if at all, have you done?

P6: No planning. I thought about it periodically. But nothing, nothing really, you know, established just kind of a little bit.

I know it kind of it kind of hit me the other day, because I got a thing in the mail from the VA for advanced directives. And I thought, what are they sending this to me for? So, you know, because I feel like I'm pretty healthy. And, you know, the idea of passing is, is far from my mind. Yeah. So I haven't really given any, you know, hardcore thought to, to the, to that process.

Moderator:
Okay, got it. So you said you would start to think about a little bit. Do you recall what prompted that initial thinking process, I guess?

P6: Um, I you know, I don't even know what prompted it I think I think one time we got to go see a free movie if we went and listened to this mortuary talk about very old stuff, you know Why not listen to it for 20 minutes, you know Um that that might have been part of it, but I remember years ago. I was pretty young I was in Portland and I said, oh, this is a beautiful cemetery because I saw the national cemetery I said it's a beautiful place that I think I'd like to be buried somewhere like this.

It's so pretty You know, and then I just went well last memorial day. I was at the The one in Boise and it's absolutely beautiful cemetery and I thought well, this wouldn't be such a bad place. But you know, I um I haven't really thought that far Yeah, I you know, it's just a place In my mind a place to just to hold your your mortal body, you know, so it's really more about The people you know that um You leave behind I think some of that's more about but about that than it is about your personal self. 

Moderator: Hmm. Okay. Yeah, and then so have you have there been any communication at this point with anyone around you about what potential wishes might be?

P6: Um, I think my husband and I have rushed on it periodically. Yeah.

Moderator: Has there been anything written down or is it purely a conversational so far? No, okay. Got it. We're going to move to a specific benefit available to veterans, the pre-need burial benefit. First, are you familiar with it?

P6: No.

Moderator: Okay, so what it comes from the funeral home industry, for lack of a better term, pre need meaning before the time of need of the meeting. And so it is an application to to see if you are eligible to be buried in a national VA cemetery.

And so you apply. And you once they've made a does that or I before have like now that I've explained it had had you heard of anything like that before.

P6: No, I haven't. I just assumed that it was an automatic thing. You're a veteran, you can be buried in a national cemetery.

Moderator: Okay, got it. Got it. Okay. Yeah, any. 

So now that I have told you about it, any any thoughts on what information you might want to know about as much as since you've mentioned, you've seen a couple of cemeteries that maybe you might like to be

P6: Yeah. Well, my understanding, let's see. I do want to, well, I do want to be buried in a, in a military cemetery, for sure. And I just always thought that my, my military funeral would be of no cost to the family. So that list, that's always been kind of in the back of my mind, but I never moved forward on anything. I didn't really know what to do. 

Moderator: Sure. Sure. Okay. Got it. Any thoughts on why or why not you might want to apply for the pre-need eligibility?

P6: Well, I think, like I said, having gone through with my father and my father-in-law, it sure takes a lot of the plight for those in the behind.

Moderator: Okay, got it. So, and like I said, like, once, when someone does apply, they get a decision either, yes, you know, two, two, two options. Yes, you're eligible. No, you're not eligible. Thoughts on how you might like your loved ones to have access to that information, that information. Let's say, yes, you are eligible.

P6: Mm hmm. Well, I would tell my kids.

Moderator: OK.

P6: My husband would know, and I'd tell my kids what they knew.

Moderator: Yeah, got it any and thoughts on would there be anything that you would like from the VA in order to make things easier for them to to access. Let's say the fact that you had that you already were determined to be eligible.

P6: I don't know. Um, I'm not sure. Okay. Um, yeah, I'm not sure. That's fine. All right.

Moderator: Okay, so jumping, jumping away from that just for a moment. Have you, super broadly, have you filled out many forms or really any forms through the VA?

P6: Nothing. 

Moderator:
Nothing? Okay, so let's do I'm gonna we're gonna do a little screen sharing. Do you know how to screen share on your zoom app?

P6: Oh, I think I have to hit me. That's a horrible picture of me. Oh my good. Then I tap it. Um, yeah, there's a.

Moderator: Okay, yeah, so go ahead and share your screen.

P6: Okay, what, oh my screen. Okay. Start recording or captioning with zoom. Yep.

Moderator: Yeah, there might be a start broadcast, I think, usually what comes up.

P6: Okay.

Moderator: Okay.

P6: Let me. Oh, my goodness. OK, I don't know what this is. Oh, it's what am I? Oh, it's asking me to draw over other apps. What am I?

Moderator: Oh, that's right. Yeah, that's the oh, is it the display over other apps permission?

P6: Must be.

Moderator: Yeah, so yeah, is there, I forget if there's a yes or something.

P6: Well, they're all turned on, all the deco pic. I don't even know what that is. I don't know what deco pic are. 

Moderator: I do not know what deco pic is..

P6: It looks like I can share everything with you. OK.

Moderator: Okay, and then you may have to go back to Zoom after you do that.

P6: Am I there?

Moderator: Not yet.

P6: Well, it went back to the face piece, I mean to me, but in my, uh, I don't know what, I don't know what I'm supposed to share.

Moderator: Well, so are you on? Are you within Zoom? Excuse me. Now, is it? Are you trying?

P6: I'll share my screen. You want me to show you my screen?

Moderator: Yep.

P6: Start recording or casting with Zoom. We'll have access to the info on your screen or played from another phone. Oh, password famous. Okay, so we're going to take me back to that same screen. Let me see. Maybe I have to do an okay at the bottom.

Moderator: Yeah, I know when I was testing out the display over other apps permission, I had to select like there was something where I had to select zoom specifically.

P6: I did. It wasn't on. Yeah, let me turn all this stuff and then we don't have to worry about it. Okay, so now I'm on Zoom and so that, oh, maybe I just have to tap it.

Moderator: Um, yeah, if you want to tap and then go back to share, if you're not already there. Okay. Oh, yes. Yes, it is. It says you started screen sharing. Okay, great. Yay. It worked. I love when things work. Sometimes it takes a little bit, but that's okay.

Okay. So, um, oh, if you, I think you can, um, swipe my video, the little rectangle, swipe it off to the right. It should do a little minimize thing. Um, yeah, yes, exactly. I think I discovered that one by accident. All right. So now I'm going to send a chat message that should show up within a zoom chat. Um, there we go. Yes. Emily to meeting group chat at the bottom. We have you tap on that. This is just going to send you to the VA sites. So we're not going to a,

P6: Where did it go?

Moderator: Oh, tap up in the black area just to get rid of that. Yeah.

P6: That went away.

Moderator: Yeah, where oh, I think where it says more. There's a little red one. So we want to get to the captions. I know. Tap again. Tap again on the top. This is chat chat there. Oh, there. Oh, that was rather hidden. Okay, yes, chat.

I do saw that. Okay, yeah. So tap on that website. And this is just going to send you to the VA. So again, I'm not going to have you fill anything out. This part is the actual application. But I know there's a lot of information here, so I'm not going to have you read through everything. This is more just a brief overview of, as you see, the burial benefits. So we're going to pretend that you are looking information for preparing for your own burial. Thoughts here on what you might be looking for, specifically when looking for information for your own burial.

P6: Probably the first thing I would want to say is, um, um, let me see. Oh, well, I guess get the benefits. Yeah, that would be the first one plan then. Yeah, that's probably get burial benefit. Yeah. Get burial benefits probably the first.

Moderator: Yeah, and then thoughts on what questions you might want answered as you are looking into preparing for your own burial?

P6: Well, I guess the eligibility is is a big one. I just assumed everyone that was honorably discharged was eligible. 

Moderator: OK, got it. Okay, and then how about, and again, I know that I don't want you to read everything, but thoughts on how clear information is presented here for preparing for your own burial?

P6: Um remain better and burial allowance oh yeah you know what I remember that for my dad

Moderator: Mm hmm.

P6: Because they they did the headstone that's all they provided was a headstone for my dad because i know his wife didn't want to put him in a national cemetery we you know we offered to help with that and she didn't want to do that okay and then the same thing with a spouse's the spouse as well because i know my uncle and his wife are both buried in the in the in a in a in a in a national cemetery okay yeah and i and but i don't know anything about how she she passed before he did and so i know that she was buried there before he was okay i don't know anything about how that went about okay got it

Moderator: So since you, I'm going to go back to your mention of you assume you would be eligible because of your honorable discharge. Thoughts on the information included here? Is it helpful? Is there more information that you would want to know right here specifically in regards to eligibility?

P6: Well, can I click on the eligibility button?

Moderator: Uh, sure. Yeah. Yeah, this is this the website.

P6: Because I'm just curious what it says who's eligible sometimes they get it gets really convoluted when you start looking at it okay the person qualifying veteran who did not receive oh okay wait a minute reread that. Veterans if they meet one of these person who didn't did not receive it oh boy that's so backwards. Wow okay that was that I said I had to reread that that was confusing people qualified for benefits service members that I did not know that your minor child very a married adult dependent child okay all of that reads well except that first one seems so backwards

Moderator: Mm-hmm. Okay, they did not receive a dishonorable discharge. Yeah.

P6: Yeah, that's very confusing, almost like a double negative, it's really confusing.

Moderator: Got it. All right, let me have you go back to the previous page.

P6: I think that's right, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Moderator: That's right. And then, so we're going to pretend that you have chosen to apply for the pre-need burial. So first, now that you're seeing any additional thoughts on how it could be helpful to your family members by applying for this.

P6: Well, I'm sure, I mean, it's not easy to plan anything, and especially I would imagine it to get into, it's not just like any cemetery on this, you know, down the street, it's, you know, I'm sure there are things that have to be considered and those kinds of things. And with the pre-need, I would imagine that possibly, you know, the plots are already picked and things. And then that way, it just makes it so much easier for the family. And it would just, you know, they would have all that information while the office at the cemetery and say, hey, this is what's going on. And then however that works out.

Moderator: Let me have you tap on the pre-need burial eligibility determination, and again, not going to have you fill anything out, I promise. So just a quick overview on here, so again, we're going to pretend that you have chosen to apply for this, thoughts on what you would need in order to apply or maybe questions that you might want answered once you've decided that you would like to apply for this?

P6: Okay, all of the steps alone. Okay, find out if you're eligible now that was before we did the other eligibility thing. Oh, you can pick your cemetery. That's kind of cool. I know Arlington has very strict restrictions. Yep. Oh my gosh. Now there's three documents. Oh, this is if you're fine. Right. Okay. And then be sure to fill out an application for some questions. Oh, okay. And then it tells you me. And, yeah, pretty seems pretty There's about. Some new personal information. On this is if you're helping somebody else. That seems pretty straightforward.

Moderator: Okay, great. And then thoughts on if you were to choose to apply how you might start start the application process.

P6: Well, it's got a button right there at the bottom. You just click on the button.

Moderator: Okay, do you have thoughts on if you would choose to do it on your phone or on a laptop?

P6: Yeah, I'd probably do it on a computer because the screens are bigger. That's another thing. 

Moderator: The size. Okay. Got it. Yeah, all right. With might there be any reason that you can think of that you would you would choose to start it on your phone instead? 
P6: Not really. 

Moderator: Okay, great and any thoughts, would you ever need to or what do you think you would be asking for help from anyone while filling this out?

P6: Um, only if I got stuck.

Moderator: OK.

P6: But you've got pretty good information here on what I need to do it, so I don't think I have to worry about that.

Moderator: Okay, good. And since you saw the the list of required information, sense of how easy or difficult it would be to gather everything that's needed.

P6: It seems pretty simple, pretty straightforward, you know, because it says need your DD-214, your golden ticket, or everything. I've never heard that described that way. I like that. That's, you know, it tells you exactly what you need. I saw the list somewhere here, but wherever it was that it said.

Moderator: Yeah, and do you I'm going to use your term of golden ticket is a is that something you you keep on the ready or what how do you how do you

P6: In all the moves and all the places and all the things in my life that my my brown folder from the military is the one thing that I have always kept track of and then when we moved in this last move it got misplaced and I was in frantic panic for about a year and all of a sudden there it was and 

Moderator: Oh my goodness after a year 

P6: After a year well yeah and it was probably it was in a you know wherever it was it was an obscure place it was safe I think it was just in a really obscure place and it was like this relief and and I just I even moved my eyes and I said I can't believe after you know 40 something years I I finally lost it

Moderator: Well, it's back now, so...

P6: Yeah, no, we have it, absolutely, yeah.

Moderator: All right, I'm going to send you another link over the Zoom chat, so let's see if it comes up, or you may have to switch back to the Zoom app to see the message that I just sent. So I'm going to switch to your Zoom app. There we go. There we go. The very long link there. Okay, so we'll just take it up.

P6: We don't have to type all that in. Oh, you know.

Moderator: I would never expect you to do that, I promise. All right, give it a moment to load here. So what we're gonna be looking at, now we're into a prototype, so most things won't be working. So what you will see momentarily is really a couple pages of the online application for the pre-need that you just saw. And so wait for that to load, load, load, load, load, load. So almost there. Almost there, there we go. Okay, you can X out of that. We don't need you signing in for anything. All right, excellent.

So go ahead and tap the, so again, this is the application here. We're gonna be pretending you are filling it out on the phone, even though I know you already said you didn't want to. Yeah, so pausing here on this page of the documentation you would be needing, any thoughts on potentially uploading from your phone here? I know you said you, of course, you know where your DD-214 is, but any thoughts of potentially uploading it here?

P6: Um does it tell you let's see um I'm thinking about people that are older than me um and how much um they struggle with things because you would have to take well with your phone that would be nice because you just take your phone and then you send it from your phone um into this um but a lot of people don't know how to do that older people don't know how to do that kind of stuff i do if my husband were to do this he would have no clue what this means and i know several veterans actually in my dav unit i'm the only one that knows how to use a computer

Moderator: Ah, OK.

P6: So, um, it's, it's really, it's really tricky. DAV has gone to all electronic, um, communication. They don't, you can't send any paperwork in that way anymore. And, and I, it's just, it's, it's thrown everybody, you know, for a spin because they don't have a clue on how to use a computer, something like this. So that's just a tidbit of information.

Moderator: Um, that's good to know. Okay. 

P6: Uh, older vets really struggle with, um, with the use of, uh, doing this kind of stuff, you know, especially on a phone. We still have guys with flip phones. So anyway, um, okay. Just so you know, um, for me, this is easy. I just take a picture of whatever. And, um, yeah, it's straightforward for me.

Moderator: Got it. So yeah, so you said it certainly would be easier to take a picture to upload everything. Thoughts on potential problems with using your phone? I know we've talked about often things are too slow, or sorry, too small and not slow.

P6: Screen sizes. Is this is the app set up to use both on phones and tablets?

Moderator: I think so? I'm actually, you know, I don't actually know the answer to that. I should know that.

P6: I've been to several different apps to put them on my tablet and they say you can only use them on your phone. My recommendation would be that it's available both on a phone and something like a tablet because I tend to use my tablet most of the time. It would be so much better for me to use my tablet to take the pictures and do it simply because I have a small phone and the screen is challenging and like I said the memory and all that.

Moderator: Got it. Well, I just got confirmation that it is available on both tablet and mobile, so that is my colleagues told me so. That is good to know.

Okay, where was my next question? Okay, so let me have you tap the little submit button on the lower right. We're going to get to the next page. There we go. Okay, so we're going to pretend that you have completed your application. Um, so we're going to stay on this page just for a moment. What would you expect the next steps would be after you've just submitted this?

P6: Let's say to print this page, is there an automatic, does it say there's an, oh yeah, you'll get an automatic e-mail and I guess you just wait at that point. I mean, there's not much that can be done until you have an answer.

Moderator: Okay, got it. Since you said you would just wait, would there, would you be looking for any additional communication while you're waiting?

P6: Well, the confirmation email that you submitted is important, and then hopefully it doesn't take six months to get your answer. I would think if it was more than a couple of weeks, it would be nice to know, hey, we're in the works, you know, automated or what, but it would just be nice to know that it's not sitting on someone's desk.

Moderator: Got it. OK, and then any thoughts of how exactly you would want to know that, yes, it is in progress, and here's where it is.

P6: Well, an email would be fine for me. Some people would probably want a letter, you know, but for me, an email is fine.

Moderator: Okay, got it. And thoughts on how important would it be to you to know where in the process this application is?

P6: Um, well, I guess that kind of goes back to the, uh, what I just said about getting something, you know, so in, you know, as it goes through the different steps, if, if, if there was communication to say, you know, first we received it, then, you know, this is in this place in that place. I think it's important to know that, especially if it's a long process, you know, sometimes people tend to feel forgotten.

Moderator: Okay, got it. So now we're going to jump ahead in our pretend timeline, and we're going to say that a decision has been made on your application. Talk to me about how you would expect to be notified that, yes, the decision has been made, you are eligible, let's say.

P6: Um, an email would be a good start, but I do think that there needs to be, um, some sort of documentation, mailed. So they mailed, you know, something to keep in your files so that, you know, when you do pass your family has it.

Moderator: Mm-hmm. Okay. That's one of my next question. What would you want to do with, you said files, any other thoughts of anything else you would want to do with, let's say this letter, as you said?

P6: What? I'm sorry, I missed.

Moderator: Let me rephrase. So you were saying you would expect a letter to be sent and possibly also an email. Are there other ways you might want to be able to access that decision?

P6: Um, well, it wouldn't do me any good if I were dead to be able to access the VA. Um, so, um, I mean, I guess it would probably be in where I'm just thinking that, you know, that, um, happens, um, just like where you go in and get your eligibility letters and all that kind of stuff that it would be in that spot. So with, with other letters? Um, yeah, I would think that it would be there, but the documentation, I just think, you know, some sort of certificate or something that, that something tangible that the family will have that makes it easier.

Moderator: Okay. Got it. And you had said  you would put it in some file for others. Would there be any other way that you would want to make sure that others, your loved ones, would have access to the information?

P6: Well, I'd probably send them a copy so that they would have it or, you know, yeah, or let them know that where it was or something like that so they’re aware

Moderator:
Yeah, okay, got it. And then thoughts on any support or communication you might want from the VA, especially if, let's say, others would need to find that decision?

P6: Um, I would imagine it’s in your records, I don't, I don't know it, it would be nice in like the letter, you know, confirmation or whatever, or some sort of communication from the cemetery that you, you know, that you chose that they write and, and say, you know, this is Jake from the, the Boise veteran cemetery and we, you know, we've not received your reservation, but you know what I mean.

Moderator: Okay, so just some acknowledgement, it sounds like that.

P6: Exactly. Yeah.

Moderator: They're aware.

P6: Yeah, and they could even, you know, they could put, you know, you, this is, you know, these, this is the plot you chose or, or, you know, if, well, at that point, you wouldn't have had a plot chose. But anyway, just something that acknowledges that they know, and, you know, you come on down and we can do whatever it is you need to do or whatever the case may be.

Moderator: Got it. Okay. And now let me have you scroll down to the bottom of this page and then tap on the continue button. There we go.

So now we're going to tap on the go, the pink go to my VA. All right. So we're going to pretend that your name is Sammy Smith and this is your my VA. So really same questions as we had before. We're going to go back in time in this pretend timeline of you have sent in the application, it's in that waiting period. Any thoughts here on, would there be places here you might look for where, like the status of the application?

P6: Oh, that's education. I would think right here it would be in this part benefit applications and forms.

Moderator: Okay, and what exactly might you be looking for if you went to this section?

P6: Just, um, status, you know, like it said on the, your benefit, I mean, where you get your benefits up here or your claim, something along that line, so that it knows.

Moderator: So right there, got it. And then jumping ahead again in our pretend timeline, that the decision has been made. Thoughts on where you might find, say that letter or certificate that you mentioned, would there be a place here you might look for it?

P6: Probably, this is just applications. Debts. Probably, oh, this is claims and appeals. Why? I would imagine somehow right in this area right in here, where it would say, yeah, something, I mean, probably a new header and something that would say, you know, pre-burial or whatever, whatever the terminology would be, something along that line. Yeah, so it's right there.

Moderator: Okay, got it. And then again, going to the question of, you know, making sure that your loved ones had access to it, thoughts on from here, any, any way that you would want to make that easy to make sure that your loved ones had access to the to the decision letter.

P6: I don't know. I mean, that means you give them your password. I don't know. I don't know if that's necessary. I mean, maybe I don't know that it's necessary for the family to get into my VA. I mean, it seems like there's a lot of steps that would have to happen. You know, unless I share all my passwords with my kids, and I don't know if I want to do that. Yeah, okay. Yeah.

Moderator: Okay, so since you wouldn't want your loved ones logging into your account, would there be other ways that you would want to make sure that they had access to the information?

P6: Well, gosh, it sure messed everything up, I was going to say. I would hope that they could call the VA and it would be easily accessible.

Moderator: Okay, got it and then the yellow go to VA app at the bottom tap on that and this will be the last page we look at Okay, so we're gonna be this is the pretend app. Nothing is nothing is real, of course. So so same question. Let's pretend you are on the VA app. Going back in time in our in our fake timeline of you have applied but you are in the waiting period, thoughts on where you might want to see the status information of where the application is?

P6: Well, you could put it right in here. This looks like My HealtheVet. Activity, but if, um, let's claim that it would have, yeah. yeah, if it said somewhere in here, um, another one of these blue boxes, probably Applications or something along that line, or, um, I don't know how you would word it, you know, non-medical applications or.

Moderator: Okay.

P6: I don't, I don't even know what you would, your pre-need buriall, whatever you want to call it. It might be really nice to have something like that.

Moderator: Okay, good. And thoughts on how often you might want to look for an update?

P6: I probably wouldn't. 

Moderator: Okay. Got it. 

P6: I mean, unless, unless I was like, just really, um, I, you know, once or twice, I'd probably go in and look, but it wouldn't be something that weighs heavy on my shoulders, you know? Maybe if I were infirmed in the hospital or something, I might want to, but that's about it..

Moderator: Got it. And then one last thing, you know, jumping ahead in the timeline, the decision has been made, thoughts on where in the app here, you might want to have access to that, that information that yes you are eligible.

P6: Same thing in a little blue box, you know, where you can say whatever, you know, burial benefits or something.

Moderator: Mm-hmm. Okay. And thoughts for what you might do with that information if it is on the app here.

P6: Well, it's something to have that I for myself I would I would just know and I would be able to tell my family. Okay, this is, you know, it's been approved and this is the plan, but it wouldn't benefit anybody but me.

Moderator: Okay, got it. All right. Okay, so those are, no, the screen just went black, but that was actually all my questions I had.

P6: I'm afraid I'm going to turn them off. Ah, there it is.

Moderator: Yeah, totally fine. You are our mind reader because we had just gotten to the end of that part, but I'm just going to ask Natasha and Cat, were there any questions do you want to ask of [REDACTED] here? If so, you can unmute and just ask them. Okay, I'll take that as a no.

[REDACTED], is there anything else you would like to share regarding the burial benefits that you have not already shared with us?

P6: I don't think so. I've learned a lot over the years. And I wonder, having, I don't know how to ask this. And it may come down to funeral home directors, but getting, having military honors at, at funerals. And if there's a way to, gosh, a way to put that as part of the pre-need, I know going to a national cemetery, it's automatic. But if there's a way for people to know how to access that, that information, you know, you, you might have a veteran who's not a part of VFW or, or American Legion or any of those organizations. And that, you know, that passes and their family has no way of knowing where to go or what to do.

Moderator: Hmm

P6: Like I said, I don't know if that's a funeral director thing or what, but just that's something I think about sometimes, you know.

Moderator: Okay, so you'd want to have that clarified, it sounds like.

P6: Well, something simple for people, like I said, the older, I really work with a lot of older vets and it's a whole different world than the younger vets. I mean, it's two totally different mindsets to be, I'm kind of on that breaking point where I can use computers and more modern things, I'm still behind, I mean, my little granddaughter can probably tell me more than I know.

But then you have, like I said, the vets that are probably Vietnam era and older are just, and they're the crux of our population right now, I think. And they are not a lot of, a majority of them, I don't believe are computer savvy.

Moderator: Hm, okay.

P6: Got to be a way to get these people comfortable with that kind of stuff. So I don't know how to, even how to address that. That's not my, I'm not a computer person.

Moderator: It's a good thing to bring up though.

P6: You know, I just, I, it's really, I really see it all the time. And, and, um, it's, it's a, it's a huge challenge, you know, I'm grateful that I know what I know, you know, because, um, even as little as it is, it's better than some others.

Moderator: Got it.

P6: So, yeah.

Moderator: Well, thank you so much for your time today. Really, really appreciate it. I just want to confirm once again, now that we've had the whole conversation, are you still comfortable with us potentially sharing a clip from today's session?

P6: Absolutely.

Moderator: Okay, great. Thank you. So yeah, this is it's always so helpful to talk with veterans about your actual experiences about what you need, what you want. So thank you much so much for taking the time.

Perigean will be sending you a thank you note, following up with you there. And yeah, I really appreciate you taking the time and hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.

P6: Thank you so much. You have a great day.

Moderator: Alright, thanks. Take care.

P6: Bye.
