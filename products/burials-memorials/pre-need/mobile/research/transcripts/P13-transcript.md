# P13

[Moderator] : there we go. So to confirm, are you comfortable that I record audio and video as we talk today?  : Yes, ma'am, okay. And are you comfortable if I potentially share any clips from the session today?

[P13] : Yes, I'm comfortable.  : Great, thank you. Okay. So first, st I'd love to know just a little bit about you as a veteran. What branch of the military did you serve? And when did you retire or separate?  : I was both Navy and Air Force?  : Navy was 1996 to 2,008, and then Air Force was 2,009 to 2015.

[Moderator] : Okay. Great.

[P13] : Just separate a veteran.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. And what has been your involvement, if any, with the Va.

[P13] : Most all of my primary care. Health is done through the Va.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P13] : Yeah, I am a Federal employee. So I also have private insurance, too. I use everything through the Va, and I also have disability benefits.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? Got it all right. And how about the the website and or app of the Va, are you using those. And in what context? If so.

[P13] : I have the app on my phone. [REDACTED]

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P13] : So you know, I I'm used to navigating, you know, the va.gov website and the app calls, you know both.  : I'd use it, for, you know, to renew my prescription. Send secure messages to my help team.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. And are you? With the Va website is that are using that on your phone, on the on a computer, a mixture of both.

[P13] : I mixture of both. I have the app on my phone, and I also have the va.gov saved as a favorite on my my laptop at home.

[Moderator] : Got it. What sort of instances? Are you choosing to use the the phone over the the computer.

[P13] : The phone. I use if I'm at work, and you know, I have to look something up like if  : I know I'm within 2 weeks of you know my prescription running out, and I haven't received nothing yet. I'll use the, you know. I'll use the the app  : at work while I'm at work, just to see if it's tracking, if it's a refill and in progress and everything.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P13] : And when I had, when I had claims in, I was using it to  : follow the claim process and everything but  : as far as that, you know, I don't use it for that anymore, because  : and I'm happy with the percentage I have.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?  : Okay? Any any other instances where you would choose to use the phone over your computer?

[P13] : No,  : if I got, if if I have to do something where I have to send documentation like when I did, the pre approval for the the burial. I use my laptop, but the phone is just if I'm out and I have to do something, send a secure message to my doctor, or respond to a Re. A secure message from them.

[Moderator] : Okay. Good.  : Okay. So, speaking pretty broadly about any sort of benefits that you are entitled to. How have you learned about them over the years.

[P13] : I've I belong to  : a couple of Facebook groups that are veteran geared, you know, towards benefits and everything else. I get the emails from the Va  : like weekly emails. And then I also get weekly emails from the Maryland Department of Veterans affairs, too. That kind of, you know. Lets me know what and self education.  : you know, as far as the claims process. I I did everything myself, you know.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P13] : I learned how it worked, and you know what I had to look at so.

[Moderator] : and what resources have you found to be the most helpful? As you mentioned a bunch of ways that you find out.

[P13] : With with the disability part.  : learning the 38 Cfr and the M. 21. Because that is what raiders use to rate your. You know your your diagnosis and and your disabilities. So if you know what they're using the rate, you know. And you also know what medical records and documentation. You need to get to that. You know that 10 or that 20%, you know, based on where you feel you should be at.  : Lovely.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it, got it. And specifically about burial benefits. I know you already mentioned something you've done. Same question. Do you recall when or how you 1st learned about burial benefits.

[P13] : I'm a person, you know, like I said, I'm a Federal employee.  : I'm a person that will sit, you know, when I have some time during lunch, and I'll look at Opm. Just click the down buttons and read.  : because if you're in the government you gotta learn how the government works. And I did the same thing with the Va site.  : Go to the bottom and find, you know, and there's a lot of stuff you can click on, and when you're on the site, it also, you know, allows you to navigate on the left to, you know all the dropdowns that  : and I just click. And I learn. And  : I kinda you know, I kind of when I find things out that other veterans don't know. I work with a lot of veterans because I work for the army.  : I try to pass on the knowledge.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay, got it.  : So you said so you had. It sounds like you came across the burial benefits with all of your reading. Have there been other places that you have seen specifically burial benefits mentioned.

[P13] : Well, I I know we're eligible for them, and  : I've done on occasions where I've shown, you know, gone out to cemeteries for unaccompanied veterans. So you know, you learn that way. I belong to the Vfw. I belong to the dav, so I you know I learn a lot through them and what you know, the emails they send, what we're eligible for.  : And and just, you know,  : personal responsibility, you know. Learn learn what you're eligible for, and a lot of people don't.

[Moderator] : Okay, a lot of people may not know. Are there places that you? You would like to see these burial benefits mentioned?  : So that more do know.

[P13] : Not edit.  : If you're a veteran.  : I'd like to see the Va. Send out something to veterans, and you know I mean they have the Welcome Guide, which is pretty good. But a lot of it surprisingly  : that it's also a military side, too. The Military side's got to educate people when they're getting out.

[Moderator] : Hmm! And.

[P13] : That's a little lax. It's it's gotten bad.  : Where? I'm seeing like on the 3 veterans, Facebook groups. I belong to  : seeing a lot of people getting out, and they don't. They don't have a taps. Class.

[Moderator] : You're welcome.

[P13] : You know they don't have. They don't don't have knowledge of the Bdd program, you know, which allows them to file for disability when they're in as they're getting out. It's just a lack of education and coming down from the top.  : you know, when people are getting out when they're becoming veterans.  : That as far as my personal thing.  : I knew where to go. A lot of people don't know where to go, and a lot of people.  : It starts not with the health side. More disability side when they get turned down.  : It's the Va's out to get me, you know that kind of, added they. They quit.  : and they don't, you know, they don't follow through, and  : the Va. Is very good at explaining why a claim was denied, why a claim was approved.  : and everything in them 8 pages of them letters set tell you everything that they use  : your evidence. The Federal regulations that they looked at.  : and they also tell you, if you're denied how you would qualify.  : Everything's explained, and a lot of people.  : There's a lot of people that don't want to do the work.  : and a lot of people don't get past the 1st page as far as for disability, where they say you rewarded or you're denied, and they don't look at the other pages, and read the whole letter.

[Moderator] : Hmm.

[P13] : That's where I think the Va. Lacks is  : something on that top letter should say, hey, read the whole thing.  : you know, or you know, if you're a veteran  : a lot of people know to go to the Va. Hospital to the Eligibility Center and Enrollment Center.  : And you know, look okay. You may not have a disability rating, but you're still eligible for health care.  : You know, and there's there's just a lack of  : lack of put. I guess you know a push to educate veterans as they're getting out, or even while they're in, you know.  : And I you know I've I've seen, you know. I worked near an you know, one of the armories for National Guard  : and the family services does have some stuff related to Va. But not a lot.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay.  : Got it.

[P13] : Some services. Just you know. Okay, you're getting out. Boom. You're on your own.

[Moderator] : Hmm, got it. Okay.

[P13] : So.

[Moderator] : Okay. Got it? Switching gears a little bit slightly for a moment. How have you been involved in the planning? Excuse me, the planning of anyone's funeral in the past.

[P13] : No, no. I just see like I said, the Maryland Department of Veterans Affairs sends weekly emails out.  : and they'll have an article that there's unaccompanied veterans, veterans.  : and if you know I'm I'm fortunate Mondays off, so if if it falls on a Monday, I'll go you know. I don't want to see anybody get buried. You know a fellow vet without the honors that they you know they deserve.

[Moderator] : Okay, great.  : And tell me about what sort of thinking or planning you have done regarding, your own wishes for for any potential burial?

[P13] : Well, I mean for me and my wife.  : I do have a will a living will, and you know and you know  : can't can't remember the medical, the medical form, you know whether to resuscitate or not.

[Moderator] : Oh, yeah.

[P13] : And and you know, and I also have in my lockbox  : all my, you know, like my Va home guarantee.  : you know, for the home loan. I have my pre approval for my, you know  : for burial at either a State or a national site, and then, you know.  : I live in Maryland now, but I'm originally from Philadelphia, so my 1st choice would be to go home to Washington's Crossing, so I've also made that known that, you know I would like to be very Washington's Crossing, if not.  : than you know, somewhere in Maryland.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. And do you recall what had prompted you to start all of this planning that you've done.

[P13] : Well, I'm a recovering alcoholic who just celebrated [REDACTED]. And  : we're not promised tomorrow. So you have to be prepared.

[Moderator] : okay, got it? And and you had mentioned that? So you're, you've discussed with with your wife, have you have you informed other people of? Of wishes for? When you're gone.

[P13] : Yeah. My brothers and sisters know.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P13] : My wish. I want to be buried, you know, in a military veterans cemetery.

[Moderator] : And is that how? How have you communicated to everybody those wishes.

[P13] : I mean with with my wife, you know we when we sat down to do our will and everything, you know.  : we were sitting there with the, you know, with our attorney, discussing everything, and then with my brothers and sisters when we you know family family functions.  : You know I may I? I tell them I served the country? I would, you know.  : want to be buried with, you know. With military honors, and  : and you know go to a veteran cemetery.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it.  : And then, so you had mentioned you you it, sounds, like, you have the the pre need form filled out. That you wish to be buried in.

[P13] : Yeah, I did the form online. Detach my Dd, 2, 14. And then they sent me a letter saying, You know I I have the pre. You know I have the approval.

[Moderator] : Okay. Great. Do you recall when you did this.

[P13] : I started like 2 years ago, and I think I finished it. You know, I finally uploaded my Dd, 2, 14, I think.  : like last May or June.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?

[P13] : So.

[Moderator] : Do you recall what

[P13] : If there was things

[Moderator] : Holding you back from from completing it? All at once, or did, did you? Were you? Were you waiting for things to complete it later.

[P13] : I I was at the time I was going to school finishing school. I was also using the  : The veterans readiness and employment pro program.

[Moderator] : Okay. Yeah.

[P13] : Finish my degree. So I, you know, kind of preoccupied. And one time when I was in work, okay, I see the application. I started it.  : And then I realized when I would go on the Va website, it would tell me I had an active application. I needed to finish.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?

[P13] : And I knew it was just a matter of uploading my Dd. 2, 14, and I finally got around to it at home, where I keep it on a an external drive.

[Moderator] : Oh, okay, got it? Yeah, that's gonna be my next question of, if so, it sounds like you were doing that on on a computer and and not a phone.

[P13] : Yeah, I did it, you know, with my laptop at home.

[Moderator] : Okay, and was there, talk to me about why? Why you chose doing things doing that form specifically on on your computer as opposed to your phone.

[P13] : Because documents like that, even though I redact my social to the last 4.  : I like to keep those documents on an external drive at home in my lockbox. Don't like to save, you know any pii on my phone or on my laptop  : keeping it, you know, like keeping it on. And okay, when you work for  : the government and you work, Pii is very important. So yeah, just put in your head from the time you're in the military. Don't send anything, Pii.

[Moderator] : Okay, all right. Got it. And do you recall, how you specifically learned about that form.

[P13] : the the application I learned on the on the website when it was on it, you know. And it's just you click, you click on it, and it pulls it up and tells you what you have to enter, and  : you know which and like, I said, the last thing is uploading your documents and then just waiting for them. They have to do their part to make sure. Yes, you are. You are eligible, and they then they send you the eligibility. Letter.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. Do you recall how much time had passed between when you finished the application to when you received the letter.

[P13] : It wasn't long. It's less than 2 months.

[Moderator] : Okay, about 2 months. And what sort of communication was there after you filled out the application? If, before the the letter arrived.

[P13] : I I did get an email saying they received they received my documents, and you know, and then they have to, you know. Just just stand up. Letter. We re received your documents. We'll be working on your file, and you know, and then expect a decision.

[Moderator] : Okay? And were you given a timeframe? Do you recall.

[P13] : Not that I recall. You know I don't expect anything. You know anything fast from the government.

[Moderator] : Got it okay  : with with any sort of forms. Are you? Are you ever made aware of of any sort of timeline.

[P13] : Yeah, I mean, I I know the timelines for when I was, you know, doing this the disability part, you know how long certain claim would take. How long this is but I also know that.  : Yes, those timelines are, you know,  : standard timelines. But everything's changed because in 2022. And  : President Biden signed the Pact Act. You know there was a flood of disability claims that backed up the system. There's also, you know. Not enough raiders.  : you know. That's up until the hiring freeze. That was a job that was always on U.S.A. Jobs.

[Moderator] : Hmm.

[P13] : Readers and ratings examiners.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. And how about so like, so with the the the claims used to you've been mentioned, you had filed. You knew roughly rough timelines. What about any sort of updates? Or like? Sorry status updates? With that, were you? Did you receive any? Did you? Were you looking for any.

[P13] : Yeah, the  : I. I laugh because they they send out, you know now, because they're so far behind. Even, you know, with the active duty people that can file while they're on duty. The Bdd those timelines are fall behind and you get the standard, you know, copy and paste letter saying, Hey, you know we haven't forgotten about you. We're working your claim, and you know.

[Moderator] : Certainly.

[P13] : And I know it's a standard letter. Because I started. I started my claims process in 2017 and finished finished it. You know, last year, August of 2024.  : So I I know. I know that  : you know the Va. Is not fast. But  : I I you know you get both sides of the argument when you deal, you know, when you talk about the healthcare.  : and I'm fortunate. I started in Philadelphia in the healthcare system. Now I'm with you. You know the Maryland side, and I have outstanding doctors, and I don't. You know I don't want for any kind of want or need any kind of care.  : So but you know everybody's got their own individual. Take with the Va  : and the thing is is  : you gotta learn how the system works.  : Once you learn how the system works, you know how to work the system.  : And you know, you know, and you know what you have to do.  : To get around. You know a primary care, doctor, sometimes.  : or you know how to expedite it, you know, and the avenues you have to check on your, you know. Status claims the Va app tells you, you know if you have active claims. If a claim decisions been made, it's all on the app. Everything's right. There.

[Moderator] : Yeah.  : okay, any. So since, since you talked about status updates and things on the app, what is what would be ideal for you in regards to statuses of of really anything you are applying for.

[P13] : Well, like I said they. They have timelines  : that they they need to follow  : But realistically, everybody's situation is different.  : You know, on the claim side every claim is different.  : You may, you know, flood them with, you know, a hundred documents for that particular claim where somebody else.  : you know, has one document in a record. And then, you know, treatment records. And it's not as much so  : on the rating sides, like the raiders are overworked. You know, they're under a lot of pressure, and  : you're realizing now they're throwing a lot of zeros out where it's service connected. And then it's up to you to fight for the percentage you need.  : or that, you know, you should have gotten. But  : with them they're clearing stuff.  : And and you know, I mean in today's environment right now.  : Come Friday night, you know, I may be coming in. I'm off on Mondays. I may be coming in on Tuesday to sign furlough paperwork. Because I'm not, you know I'm not essential.  : Whereas one job I was essential. So.

[Moderator] : Yeah, yeah.

[P13] : Yeah. So you know it. It's  : the old adage to government doesn't work fast.  : and the Va. Is no different.

[Moderator] : Yeah.

[P13] : And like, I said, if you  : educate yourself to what the Va. Has to offer and what you're eligible for.  : you know everybody's journey is different. Everybody's situation is per, you know. It's all personal.  : I, you know I'm not like the veteran that sits in the cubicle next to me.  : His situation's totally different.  : But I also, you know, since I educated myself, I do talk a lot with a lot of people I work with, and you know, and  : tell them where to look, tell them what to do and everything. But  : and that's what the service organizations are for. But you know some are lazy, some are not.

[Moderator] : Really.

[P13] : Just like that, doctor. You gotta find that you know that that one good doctor, or you know that one good Vso that can help you with your claims process, or you or you could do it yourself.  : I did mostly everything myself, and I would just send the paperwork to a dav rep.  : just to make sure it was filed correctly because I didn't want anything coming back, saying, This is the wrong form.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? Just gonna jump again to the the Pre need form that. Of course, you've already filled out. So when you and I'm sorry was that 2 years ago I've lost track of time. And when when did you finish it?

[P13] : I started it like 2 years ago, and I finished.

[Moderator] : She just like, yes, ma'am.  : Okay. So Lester got it. So when you and was that you just received a physical letter? Is that right?

[P13] : Yeah, yeah, I do.

[Moderator] : Got it? What would be? I guess. What  : is that? Is that physical letter enough, would you? Is there? Are there other things that you would have rather rather have. In. In addition to the physical letter.

[P13] : No, I I feel it's enough, because it says I'm eligible. And then so in my documents  : depending on you know who does. My, you know, funeral services.  : Most funeral homes. Know how you know.  : and my wife knows where a copy of my Dd. 2 14 is. She knows my disability rating. She knows where the paperwork is. God, you know. God forbid! I go before her.  : You know th, this is the stuff you have to give to the funeral home, so that you know. And then also  : she also knows that that document also, you know, we have to make sure that  : if something happens to her. She's also eligible to be buried with me.  : And also it's a it's been communication.

[Moderator] : Yeah. And have you have you? Have you also filed for her as well.

[P13] : Do I have to file for her.

[Moderator] : It's an option. I don't know if if it's required. I know that is an option for spouses to file.

[P13] : Yeah.  : I don't know if it asked if you know you were married, and I had to put our information in.  : because, you know, like I said it started so long ago.

[Moderator] : Yeah, yeah, it was what I'm not sure if things have changed since then. I've only looked at it recently.

[P13] : Probably pull up my information, because, you know, they keep everything.

[Moderator] : okay, okay, got it? And so yeah, so you said, your, your wife knows, where I was where it is, you've got it with documents within a lock box.  : any. And are there are there any other? Either copies of the letter or any other references of it anywhere?

[P13] : Well, I mean, you know, on my external. So of just you know somebody plugging it in. They can see my documents.  : you know it's the one thing the military teaches you is, you know, make copies of everything.  : They're good at losing things.

[Moderator] : I, probably. Yeah, unfortunately.

[P13] : That's a definite, lovely.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay, I am going to we're just gonna go do a little screen sharing so I'm gonna have you share your screen through the zoom app.

[P13] : Okay.

[Moderator] : Screen sharing. Is it still going? As I know? Sometimes it takes a bit.

[P13] : Yeah, I'm just, you know, like it, seeing it like it was before.

[Moderator] : Oh, is it? Is it not showing any option to do the screen share.

[P13] : No.

[Moderator] : Let's say, if you if you tap on your screen, are you getting the the share button at the bottom.

[P13] : yep! Hold on! Hold on! Yep, there it is!

[Moderator] : Okay.  : And usually it's just a couple steps after that.

[P13] : Okay, it's pulling up a bunch of things. The onedrive Google drive.  : Okay? So.

[Moderator] : Could be a screen just sharing screen.

[P13] : Okay. Yep, okay, so I just allow permission.

[Moderator] : Okay, there we go. Yay, all right. Okay. So I am going to.  : Since you mentioned this is, this is a site you have been to before. But I just want to get a couple of thoughts on there.  : I'm gonna have you go. Let's see. The chat should come up. Try tapping on the phone to go. There we go, Emily to meeting group chat.  : So this is the the burials page of the Va. Which it sounds like you've already gone to.  : But let me have you tap on that to open it.  : Alright. Excellent! So I'm not. Gonna have you read through everything? A. It sounds like you already have read through everything. But also, of course, there is. A lot of information here.  : so going, you know, going back.  : we'll play a little like time jump. Pretend here of let's say you're looking for information on preparing for your own burial.  : Like, how how does this page do for that, and in terms of giving you information and answering any questions you may have.

[P13] : It, you know. I mean, it says, get veterans, burial benefits, and then plan the burial, and then it also gives you an option,  : more information and resources.  : So everything's there. And then it also allows you, if you don't know about your other benefits, to click on that.  : And most likely that's gonna take you to  : disability health care and stuff like that. So.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?

[P13] : Yeah.

[Moderator] : And then how about the since? Of course, you've already applied for for the pre-need thoughts on, just in case you haven't read this in a while, but thoughts on just how this is this is presented in terms of giving people rough information. First.st

[P13] : It's it's very easy. I mean, you know, it's got the eligibility button the pre need, burial, eligibility, determination. What your benefits are, and you know what and the benefits of the you know the burial or memorialization.  : and then also it all it lets you know.  : there's bereavement counseling, for you know other members and benefits for the spouse and dependents.  : So I mean, it's kind of a 1 stop shop.

[Moderator] : There we go. And do you recall? And I admit I can't remember if I asked this already. Do you recall when you were 1st exploring this years ago. If it was clear what the pre-need eligibility was, and why you might want to look into it.

[P13] : Yes, yeah. When you click on that pre need burial it it's pretty self explanatory. You know what what you have to fill in what information they need. And then you know, what documents they would need. So yeah.

[Moderator] : Alright great!  : And do you recall, was there anything that could have made it even easier.

[P13] : No, I mean the their site is pretty easy site to navigate.  : The toughest part now is, you know, since a lot of people just dealing with the login.gov or id  : and but  : I've been in the Government for almost 12 years, and I've already done login.gov and id me, and you know and  : I can't, you know some. Sometimes I can use my Cac. Reader at home, and it will acknowledge my cac, you know. Come in, Dod, but sometimes it won't, and then I have. I use the login.gov, but  : I've used the login.gov, for you know U.S.A. jobs So  : so I mean when I came for that study I pretty much already had everything because I you I've used it before.  : They're requiring the Va. To go to that, you know 1 1 sign in method.

[Moderator] : okay, great. Alright, I'm gonna send you another link through the zoom chat, we'll look through a prototype, so you may have to switch back to the zoom app. If the notification doesn't come up.

[P13] : Okay.

[Moderator] : If you want to see a switch back up there we go. Yep.  : The the fig.

[P13] : W dot FIGM a.com.

[Moderator] : Go ahead and tap on that one.

[P13] : Okay.

[Moderator] : Alright. Give it a moment just to load here.  : So what this is 1st gonna come to again. This. So this, this right now, is all prototype. Nothing, nothing real. Here.  : Is is going to be just a couple screens of the pre-need application on on the phone.  : And I know, since since you had filled it out on the computer. Maybe this won't. This will look a little different. So I'd still be curious just to get your thoughts on one of the page. Sometimes Sigma is a little slow, so we'll just wait.

[P13] : Yeah, well, that's what low bid gets. You.

[Moderator] : This is, this is, not the 1st time this has happened.  : That's okay.

[P13] : Well, you know, I noticed after I signed up. I got the email saying it was cancelled. So I figured you. You know, you guys might have been a contract that was Doge.

[Moderator] : That.

[P13] : And then all of a sudden.

[Moderator] : And it's.

[P13] : You were back.

[Moderator] : And then it came back. I was very happy when I came back. So yes. Now I'm happy to be able to talk to people.  : Yeah, I I know that our parenting person. She said she was able to get most of the original people back on. So I I don't know who you know how, who might have been new, but  : alright, almost there, almost. There, there we go. Okay.

[P13] : Fucking.

[Moderator] : So here we go, all prototype the actual pre-need application. From that. How it would look on the phone. Let me have you tap the start, the Pre need eligibility.  : This is just going to take you to one of the screens because there's a bunch of screens.  : So go ahead. And then there we go. Yeah, so we're pretending you've skipped ahead to step 6, of course. And yeah, this is just the the uploading. I know you said on your computer, you have an external drive where you had kept your Ddt 14, and maybe other other documents. But  : so so it sounds like the the. It was correct. Me, if wrong is, it is the the primary reason you wouldn't want to do something like this on the phone. Is for the Pii.

[P13] : Yeah, I just don't keep anything like that. In any of my documents on my phone.  : Yeah. Rather do it in the in the comfort and privacy of my own home with my laptop phone can be hacked and you know  : I mean, laptops can be hacked, too. But I just feel more secure and privacy of my home.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?  : And so outside of that, of course, do you do you see any any benefits for potentially filling this out on the phone.

[P13] : yeah, I mean, it's there. There are people that just have their own. They just have a phone. They don't have a laptop or a home computer or a work computer that you can, you know, go on to and do it. Yeah, there are people I I know people that phone exclusively.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P13] : Everything's done through their phone. So yeah, I mean, it would meet the need.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay, got it.  : And then let me have you scroll to the bottom.

[P13] : Yep.  : Okay.

[Moderator] : And then the little submit button on the lower right.

[P13] : Click, that.

[Moderator] : Yep.  : okay. So we're pretending that you have applied. And this would be, I'm not sure if this is what it looked like when you applied. But  : yeah, any any thoughts on what you had expected next? Or if this looks totally different, like, what? What would you expect next?  : Reach this page.

[P13] : This is what I saw when I hit. Submit, you know, and same thing. Print the page, you know, just to keep for your records, so that if you had to check, you know if I called the regional office and said, Hey, you know what's the status? I have a confirmation name. I mean a confirmation number.  : because I've called my regional office, you know, to get stuff.  : sometimes they tell you can't do it. So then you, you know I go downtown, Baltimore and I stand there in front of them and say, Well, you know, this is what you do here at the regional center.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?  : And then how do you? I I it's is that you said this list looks the same. So so you had received an email confirmation as well.

[P13] : Yes, yes, yeah, you you do when you do it. Online stuff on a laptop or something.

[Moderator] : Okay, yeah. And you said that did not include a timeline right of when you'd expect next steps.

[P13] : I I don't recall.  : Yeah, I I don't tell you. Yes, because, you know, like I said it was so long ago.

[Moderator] : Yeah, I don't know.

[P13] : Call them, saying, You know, given a timeline.  : But, like everything else with their processes, they probably do have a defined timeline.  : And it's just, you know, the amount of work and who's doing it? And  : you know whether they get to it or not.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay, good. And then, since we're, we're looking at this page now, any further thoughts on what sort of status information you might want to know, and how you'd want to access that.

[P13] : No, I mean, it tells you right there, you know. Print it for your records, and if you're doing it on the phone, you don't have to print it. You can just take a screenshot, and you know, and you have saved  : and everything you need. You know your name, if you call like, I said, a regional office you call, and then you have a confirmation number. And  : you know, once you give them that that's important. That's the most important information. They can pull your stuff up and and look you up in the system.  : So. No, I wouldn't add anything else. Tells you that it tells you the form number, and I mean, that's probably half the you know, problem is figuring out the right form number to do some things with the Va.

[Moderator] : Got it. Got it.  : Okay? So it sounds like you and just confirming you wouldn't want any any additional information from the Va. In terms of status Updates.

[P13] : Yeah, I mean, I guess it would be nice. But you know I also know that it would be. You know it would be a copy and paste standard letter  : telling you that, hey? We're working it, working on your, you know, working on your claim, and you know, we should be getting it, you know, done in a certain amount of time, and you know, thank you for your patience. I've gotten plenty of those letters.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? Alright. And let me have you scroll to the bottom of this page here and press the continue button.  : Yeah. And then do the the pink go to my Va.

[P13] : Have a a fake profile here.  : Oh, there we go!

[Moderator] : Yep, there we go. We're gonna pretend you are Sammy Smith.  : So that I you know pretty pretty standard.

[P13] : Yup, that's everything I see on my end.  : Yeah, yeah, I'm sure it's fairly fairly similar.  : I see on my app. Yep.

[Moderator] : Thoughts on. So let's say you had, or really it could be with with any any form that you filled out. Thoughts on, including status updates for any forms you filled out here within your account.

[P13] : Well, I mean that. Would that would help, I mean, like, I said. You know it says on the bottom there application for educational benefits.  : application expires last, you know, last saved and tells you it's a draft, and  : whoever did it with didn't finish the application. That's what I saw when I went back, you know, for my eligibility, I would see that continue our application, and the continuation part was just me uploading my Dd. 2, 14.

[Moderator] : okay, got it and it and do you? And I forget. So you you go to this page a lot is that is that right.

[P13] : I mean, if I open it, you know, if I have to talk to my doctors.  : I don't have to look, you know, at. You know anything for claim for compensation. I do for my appointments. I I use the app to renew medications.  : I use the app to go to  : my health and the secure messaging. So it's convenient, you know, having my phone. And I could do this stuff.  : you know, while I'm on lunch, or while I'm on break.  : Where I don't have to log into a computer. You know, I just hit the Va app, and everything is just like this.

[Moderator] : Okay.  : so there's a lot more convenient. Got it, and switching back to again the the Pre need application. Obviously, you've already filled it out. But thoughts on how important it would be to just to to know the statuses, especially since you mentioned you like having your phone where it's just easy to to look at. You know what what all is current in your account.

[P13] : Yep, yeah. Status would status would definitely work. I mean, when when you know, hey? Okay, we expect, you know, to have an answer to you.  : It it always makes you makes everybody feel better when you can look at something and say, Okay, I expect to receive this, or I expect a decision by this time.

[Moderator] : Hmm.

[P13] : And then, you know, if you don't  : you give or take a look, you know, probably  : with with the Government about a month or 2.  : but yeah, I mean, it helps, because then you know that it's being worked.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay.

[P13] : So, yeah, yeah, any information more information is is good.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay, got it more.  : And then so for I know, obviously the the letter you have was something mailed to you. Thoughts on having a digital copy within your account here for the the pre need eligibility. Would that be useful.

[P13] : That. Yeah, that would be nice.  : considering that, you know. Back in  : 2019, we were, you know, the government was supposed to be paperless.  : Supposed to be all digital, and it keeps getting kicked down. You know. They can keep getting kicked.

[Moderator] : Yep, alright.  : and thoughts on what you would. I guess, do with the with the letter, knowing it is. It is here in your, in your account.

[P13] : Well, I mean I have the physical one. It would make it easier to save it and then put it on. You know, my external that I have underneath my, you know, military files and Va files. So we also know where it's you know where it's at, so that  : God, you know my my wife knows my login for my va app  : so she can get into it.  : But you know something should happen. Does she have the mindset to sit down and actually do it.  : You know, whereas she knows in that that fire you know that lock box, that fireproof box.  : pull out an external. Every document's there.

[Moderator] : Hmm,

[P13] : Plug it in, you know. Plug it in pull, you know. You go to the files and see that file that says you know military Va information and  : all the documents would be there. And you know it. Yeah, digital definitely makes it easier to see.

[Moderator] : Yeah.

[P13] : It's what you mentioned. Oh, sorry. Go ahead.  : Yeah. We all lose papers.

[Moderator] : Yeah, true.  : And since you mentioned so your wife has has your login thoughts going on long lines of other people having access to this pre-need eligibility. Thoughts on, say, other people having having access to the pre-need eligibility and and.  : I would want that.

[P13] : I I wouldn't. You know my wife? Yes.  : you know because she you know, she might need it. But  : I you know I also. You know my my sisters and brothers, just like I know you know, with them, you know they have a will, and you know they know. I tell them you know I keep it in my lockbox, and  : you know my wife. She knows where it's at. God forbid and then  : they also know that I keep. You know  : I keep stuff on the external I I am up  : true believer in keeping, you know, saving documents.  : You never know when you need something.

[Moderator] : Yeah, got it? And so thought so on this page here, thoughts on where you might want to access the letter.

[P13] : I mean benefits and applications. So that's I mean, that's where it would be  : applications and forms it says it right there. So.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it and let me have you tap on the go to Va. App at the bottom the little yellow box there.

[P13] : There we go!

[Moderator] : Okay. So a little fake app here. So same questions as before. In terms of status updates. For let's say, if you were applying for the pre- need, and in the waiting period.  : If here, if it might be a place that you would look for status updates.

[P13] : Probably under messages.

[Moderator] : Message, okay.

[P13] : Messages, or even click on the benefits down the bottom, you know.  : somewhere somewhere in there. Because with the benefits it's probably gonna  : show what you know, what benefit like the last screen, you know what's what's there and what's in your file, and for you.

[Moderator] : okay? And and since you mentioned the you know, the the app is something, you just like it's it's very easy and quick thoughts on having the the status of the application here in your app.

[P13] : Yeah, I mean status. Yeah, I mean, it would be good, you know, because.  : like, like, I said, the the app now is a 1 stop shop.

[Moderator] : So, okay, and how about thoughts on having the final decision letter, the eligibility letter here in the app.  : Would that be useful?

[P13] : Yeah, I mean, it would be useful, because, you know, like we discussed before, it's a digital copy  : that you know, you can click on open, save, you know, save and print, and if you need it to be, and.  : Good evening.  : I mean, like I said. My my wife knows my login, and you know, she knows how to get in my phone. So.

[Moderator] : Okay, great. So she can also.

[P13] : Yep. Get in here. Then. Okay.

[Moderator] : Great believe that is everything. Let me just check in with my team here. If  : Sean, Jonathan, Natalie, if any of you have any questions  : for Anthony here you can unmute and ask them.

[P13] : Am I okay to close this.

[Moderator] : Oh, yes, yes, you can. Thank you. Okay, so no questions there, all right. And is there anything else that you would like to share about burials and burial benefits that you have not already shared.

[P13] : No like, I said.  : The Va. Is easy to navigate. If you you educate yourself

[Moderator] : Got it.

[P13] : And like, I said, a lot of people get frustrated with the Va. And.

[Moderator] : Hmm.

[P13] : I tell them it's a it's new kind of Va. And I mean, I've heard, you know, because I belong to the Vfw. I you know I'm with Vietnam. Vet guys that are just.  : They just refused, you know, to use the Va because.

[Moderator] : To.

[P13] : They just soured the way they came back.  : Some golf 1st Gulf War. They feel like they were lost. And you know the current people know. And this generation is more tech savvy? So they're they're they know more what they're eligible for.

[Moderator] : Yeah.

[P13] : Yeah. So you know, I'm I'm 60 years old.  : But  : I kind of knew along the way in the jobs I had that. You know, you got to stay up with technology, and you know, technology can be your friend if you know how to use it.

[Moderator] : Yeah.

[P13] : So yeah, it it makes life. Life now is so much easier than it was before.  : I mean, it was simpler back then. You know we didn't have all the problems we have now.

[Moderator] : Yeah.

[P13] : You know you could pay a bill. You can. You know. You can talk to somebody halfway across the world, you know, on an app. And  : you know, it's just yeah, everything it it would make it. It makes it so much easier.  : yeah, it's just.  : you know, you have to know you have to know where to look to. And you know, since  : I've have a lot of knowledge with the Va. I try to educate as many people as I can.

[Moderator] : Yeah, that's great.

[P13] : It's kind of like, you know, when you know. When I said, you know about my sobriety, I talk about that. And some people, you know some people say, why do you talk about it all the time? Because  : somebody may be in that room that I'm talking to? That may may have overheard what I said, and it may, you know, like a light switch, click, a light bulb  : same thing with the education, you know. Hey? Do you know you're eligible for this. Do you know you're eligible for that?  : There are a lot of people in the Federal Government that don't know that they are eligible for disabled vet leave their 1st year.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P13] : Medical appointment.  : You know the government gives you an extra 104 h, because your 1st year you're  : slowly, accumulatingly, where you don't have a lot of time.  : And a lot of don't tell you that.

[Moderator] : Hmm.

[P13] : I, you know that's something I found out on my own, you know.

[Moderator] : Yeah.

[P13] : Going through Opm. And reading and educating.  : It's a matter of, you know, education. But, like I said, these  : many computers in our hands make life a lot easier for a lot of people.

[Moderator] : Yeah, indeed.  : Okay. So I just wanna check once more again. Now that we've had the whole conversation, are you still comfortable? If I potentially share clips from this session with our Va. Partners.

[P13] : Yeah, that's fine.

[Moderator] : Great, great! Thank you. Well, really appreciate you taking your time. Oh, sorry! Go ahead.

[P13] : I said, it's all about education.

[Moderator] : Yes, it is all about education, it's true. Well, I really appreciate taking your time to share with us. It's super important, of course, to talk with veterans, and I'm so happy that we got to hear your experience. This is definitely helpful, as we work to designing things for veterans. I know Perry Jane will be reaching out to you, sending you a thank you note and a little blurb in case you have other veteran friends who may want to also help with the research there.  : but that is it from us, and I hope you have a great rest of your day.

[P13] : You, too, ma'am, have a great day.

[Moderator] : Thank you. Bye-bye.

[P13] : Bye.
