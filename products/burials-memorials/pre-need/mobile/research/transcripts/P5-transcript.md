# P5

Moderator: Okay, so to confirm, are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we talk today? 

P5: I am comfortable. 

Moderator: Great, thank you. And are you okay for us to potentially use clips from this to share with our VA partners? 

P5: I am okay. 

Moderator: Thank you very much. Okay, so can you just start, can you tell me just a little bit about yourself as a veteran? What branch of military do you serve and when did you retire or separate? 

P5: So I am a 47 year old veteran. I was in the Navy for 24 years and I retired in 2021. 

Moderator: Okay, great. And can you tell me how you interact, if at all, with the VA? 

P5: With the VA, I would say mainly for appointments, my medication, those type of things. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. And do you do you go into any of the facilities? 

P5: I do. I go into a James Lovell facility, so I live pretty close to that. So I do go in person. 

Moderator: Got it. Okay, great. And then how about any use of either the website or the app? 

P5: I do. I do. Actually, recently, I did use the VA website to order my medication as far as VA benefits. Some of the things that I've had to do lately is proof of service, or service verification letters. This is why I used to be an app for that. 

Moderator: Okay. Can you tell me more about that, about specifically using the app for the proof of service? 

P5: Oh the app is really easy. Because you have to do it. I normally do a ID me check. That's really quick. And then once I get into that, it takes you right to it's on one of the front pages. And I'm able to pull up my VA benefits letter. And it has all my information, I get to pick how much information I want to put out, depending on who I have to give it to. 

Moderator: Oh, OK. Got it. In what instances are you using the app for that? 

P5: I think the last one, I didn't move into a new home. So I had to use the VA verification letter to show proof of service. I didn't want to put how much I was getting, because it gives you all of your information, but you get to choose what to put on, what to keep on, and what to take off. So that's one thing I do like about that. 

Moderator: Okay. Okay. Okay. Got it. Okay. So you, you use the app for verification with the home and any, any other instances that you use the app on a regular basis or in any instances. 

P5: I think that's one of the main things that, yeah, that, again, order medication and also talking back and forth with my provider. 

Moderator: Okay, you're communicating through the app. Got it. Okay. And then medication through the app and so are any of those things. Do you also do that on the website or is that 100% on the app that you do the medication and talking with your providers. 

P5: So as far as the providers, it'll start off by the VA and then it'll send me to the actual website. I always forget the actual medication website. So that kind of helps me. I would just go into that VA spot. Okay. Got it. So it'll, it'll redirect me when I have to order medication. 

Moderator: OK, so you're so you're starting on the app and then that it's redirecting over. Sorry, redirecting. OK, got it. So when you're on when you're on the website, is that mostly on the phone, mostly on a desktop computer. Is it a mix? Tell me about that. 

P5: If I have the time, then I'll sit down and do it on the computer. But honestly, most of the time, it'll be from my phone, I'm on the go or doing something and I'll need that information sooner than later. And so it's easy for me to pull that information that way. 

Okay, so what you're Oh, no, I was just saying, I know, when I was in school, I know I was using it to pull up information as well, as far as verification, and yet right verification, and then it'll actually let me know it'll pretty much like, let me know if for that month, for school, if I was going to get the actual stipend or not. 

Moderator: Mm hmm. So, okay, got it. And you said that, correct me if I'm wrong, I think you said you would, if you have time, you would sit down the computer or like, in what instances would you actually go to the computer, as opposed to being on your phone? 

P5: Right. If I'm already at home, if I'm already sitting down at a desktop, then I'll search it then, but is this faster? I think just click onto that. 

Moderator: Okay, go on the app, got it. All right, and any other times that you would choose to do things on the computer as opposed to on your phone. 

P5: Probably when I'm, like I said, if I'm already doing something, maybe then, but most of the time I'm out and about doing something. And it's just easy just to click on that, just that one click and go that way. Or if already had my phone on me, I would do a similar search, I would do on my laptop anyway. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. all. Great. So speak so we're going to talk about benefits. So just broadly could be across any benefits. Can you tell me how you originally learned about the benefits that you are entitled to as a veteran? 

P5: Well, I would say I originally learned just being in the military and it's a, it's a common, uh, common language. It's a, I don't want to say common knowledge, but you know, as you, uh, as you serve, you just have to learn more and more about it. It's like, and so you know about your, uh, benefits, you have active duty. And then of course, before you retire, uh, did you find out about all the benefits that you'll have on retirement as well. 

Moderator: And do you recall they said so it was in service was that talking to people was that reading was it a mixture? 

P5: It was a mixture. And especially when you retire, you have some mandatory classes. And, and they really do explain it and break down the things that you are entitled to. So 

Moderator: Okay, and these are classes that you had taken to learn to learn about the benefits. 

P5: Right. Before you get out of military or before you retire, they do make some of the classes mandatory. The way you do you don't just check out and you do learn a lot about things that you would you wouldn't normally know because most of the people sometimes you're talking to are active duty. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. Okay, cool. What resources do you feel have been most helpful in terms of learning what your benefits are since you mentioned talking to people and reading in the classes? 

P5: I would say probably one the most helpful things are probably talking to our DAV upon retire. Well, I'm on getting close to retirement, taps classes. That's a whole whole wealth of knowledge and TAPs. So I would say that's probably probably one of the biggest probably biggest forms of education I've had as far as VA benefits. 

Moderator: Okay, okay, so within TAPs, got it. And then specifically about burial benefits. Well first, how much do you know about what benefits you're entitled to in regards to burials? 

P5: I know from what I know is, I guess I would have the ability to be buried in a national cemetery and then after that I'm not too familiar with all of the entitlements. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. And have there been places that you recall, seeing any mention of burial benefits could be either something you learned in person or anything you've read anywhere. 

P5: I wouldn't say recently, I know probably 10 years ago I was a [REDACTED] during active duty so I did have to look up a lot of information and know about that but since then, you know, 

Moderator: Okay, good. Are there any places that you might like to see burial benefits mentioned that maybe you haven't come across yet? 

P5: Would you say like on an app or on a website you mean? 

Moderator: Yeah, I just like where you feel it would be useful to come across. 

P5: Um, I guess I'm thinking, I guess, I mean, when it comes to burial, I don't know, it's one of those things, I guess, until you actually need it, or to some, I don't know, it may be right there in my face. And, but I think it's one of those things until you're actually really thinking about it, or looking for it. Because, you know, when it comes to like, VA loans, or education benefits, you know, they they're kind of up everywhere. Yeah. 

Moderator: Yeah, go ahead. 

P5: I'm thinking, I'm thinking burials is one of those things that I guess, unless you're actually looking for it, because I know I've had some family members that probably in the last couple of years passed away. And so they didn't need some information. And so I was able to like Google it and it would take me to, you know, different sites. And I was able to find information that way. 

Moderator: Okay, so that perfectly leads me to my next question. Have you been involved in the planning of anyone's funeral before? 

P5: Yes. 

Moderator: Okay, and did you know ahead of time the deceased wishes? 

P5: Actually, I say yes. Dear God, 

Moderator: You're good. Yeah, go ahead. 

P5: Oh, yeah, I had it. So a good buddy of mine, probably two years ago, he was a Marine Corps. And, yeah, he had always talked about it. And so, and so we kind of had like, we knew that we would contact the VA, you know, when something like that happened for him. I would say other people, we had no idea. 

Moderator: Oh, okay, got it. 

P5: He had an uncle probably the year before that. We had no idea. He was army. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. Okay, so your friend who said that you would talk about it, was there anything written down or was it all conversation? 

P5: Conversation-wise. 

Moderator: Okay. Got it. And when he did pass, was there anything that you may have found that had been written down in terms of direction or guidelines? 

P5: If it wasn't anything written down, he had already talked about it. 

Moderator: Oh you talk about, OK, got it. Any thoughts, I know you've mentioned like an uncle who passed who you didn't know anything. Thoughts on what might have been helpful in terms of planning that person's funeral? 

P5: Uh, probably, um, yeah, probably a, uh, one, just, just like you said, reading directions or, you know, this, this something, something put in place with that person's wishes. 

Moderator: Okay, got it, got it. And then tell me about any thinking or planning, if at all, for your own wishes, for your burial. 

P5: I would say for myself, I would say cremation. 

Moderator: Okay, so do you recall what prompted you to start considering what you might want? 

P5: Actually probably planning, dealing with other funerals. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. 

P5: And, you know, I guess it kind of makes you think like, you know, you know, how do you last want to be remembered? 

Moderator: Okay, got it. And have you have you told people about these wishes? Or like, what's what sort of communication has there been so far, if any? 

P5: I've told a few people, uh, my friends, my, my oldest sister, uh, my parents. And, you know, in the case, of course, but. 

Moderator: Yeah. And anything written down? Has this all been conversation? 

P5: You know, it's all being conversation. 

Moderator: Okay, great, got it. Okay, so we're gonna be discussing a specific benefit. It's called the pre-need burial benefits. So first, are you familiar with it? Have you heard of it? 

P5: I have not.

Moderator: Okay, I will do a brief intro. So the name, the pre-need comes from the funeral world. It basically means like before the time of need, time of need is being when you're dead or when the person has passed. And so it is an application you're filling out to see if you are eligible to be buried in a national cemetery. And so it's a form you do at any point and it comes back with a decision of yes, you're eligible, no, you're eligible, sorry, no, you're not eligible, but here's the next steps you could take. So thoughts on, so now that I've given a super brief intro to that, thoughts on where you would expect and might want to find that information. 

P5: So I hope to find that under, maybe under the VA, hopefully on the VA app, maybe under search. So under burial benefits or 

Moderator: Okay, I got it. And then any thoughts on the benefits overall. If that's something you might want to do if it's if thoughts on any any any sort of questions you would want answered with it. 

P5: Uh say that again i'm sorry my headphone kind of bugged out 

Moderator: No worries. Yeah, so thoughts on if you were looking into this pre-need burial benefit, what sort of information you might want to learn about the application, maybe as you are applying. 

P5: So of course I want to know, am I eligible and how much of a, I guess from like start to a finish, how much the VA would be involved? 

Moderator: Okay 

P5: Because I know, of course, there's certain things that would be covered and certain things that the family or the outside of the family would be responsible for. 

Moderator: Okay, so what's covered? Got it. Other things you were thinking you might want to know? 

P5: Um, I would probably like to know, I guess like, uh, locations or, uh, I guess like maybe like, uh, national cemeteries, um, possibilities. I would say like, like, like national cemeteries that are like available. 

Moderator: Okay 

P5: Um points of contact with those or I guess the point of contact would have that information so yeah 

Moderator: And then thoughts on why you might want to apply for this pre-need? 

P5: I would say kind of like we just discussed before, just this is one of those things that kind of, because I have seen planning for funerals. I know sometimes when someone passes away, sometimes you don't know anything. It kind of started from scratch and I think that's the, once the ball is rolling, then it makes things easier, but sometimes it's just hard to get started. I've had, again, family members pass away and we're digging through paperwork. I mean, they're gone. You can't ask them anything. And we're digging through paperwork in the house and I just had to do that and we didn't know anything. So

Moderator: Okay, got it, got it. All right, so I think I mentioned this super briefly, but after you apply, you would receive one of two decisions. A, you're eligible, B, you're not eligible. Thoughts on what you would want to do with that information once it arrives? And I said you, like, you would just, you've had instances of searching for a sort of paperwork from people. What, yeah, what would make it easier once you have received the decision for the pre-need eligibility? 

P5: I think that it would be cool to just be attached to your information, maybe like, was that deers or somehow be a be attached in a way that I don't know, you know, sometimes some of the information come up, you know, you'll know if they're an organ donor or not, or you know, maybe some way to say that that's been completed. I don't know how that would work out, but

Moderator: Mm hmm. Yeah. Okay. So somehow attached to your I guess your your information somehow. I'm trying to. 

P5: Some type of permanent for all is like when your information comes up and your address is there. 

Moderator: Okay. Oh yeah, go ahead. 

P5: Oh no, I was just saying when the information is pulled up in your, say like your social or whatever, and then your address and phone number is there. I don't know, maybe that may be part of the information. 

Moderator: Hmm. Okay. Yep. And anything that you can think of that you might like the VA to do and in terms of making things easier. 

P5: I guess, like you were saying, if there's like a system already, like I said, what's your name, what's your name is entered, information is entered, then that's something that is just kind of like if I wanted to check the status of my education benefits, then there's a system that they know how many months I've used and what I've used is just there. 

Moderator: Okay, so like within your counter profile or something like that. Right. Okay. Got it. Got it. And then, more broad question. Have you filled out any forms, we'll start really broadly, within the VA in the past? It could be either online or any paper forms you filled out and sort of app. 

P5: I, I have I've filled out a when I was going to school, I did, I filled out some information to get contacted from a education or I think BRME representative. Okay. And then I've done that before. And if I had like any questions, I've done that on the VA, like ask the VA, I think I've done that and it was easy. And then I got responded to in a couple hours. 

Moderator: Okay, great. And was that were these forms you had filled out all online? Were they something you had to print out? 

P5: On the phone

Moderator: Okay, got it. Overall, do you generally prefer to fill things out on the phone as opposed to on a desktop or a laptop? 

P5: I think it's, it's actually, I don't mind doing it on the phone now. Some of the information is like your name and stuff, I'm sorry, pre-filled. And then I do a lot of like voice to text. 

Moderator: OK, yeah. 

P5: So that'll be it. 

Moderator: Great, got it. And then with previous forms, I know you said you'd filled things out for education. After you were completing it, what was your experience like in terms of what next steps were gonna be coming? 

P5: I think the forms, you may have to fill out the forms that I completed already. 

Moderator: Yeah, like, did you know what would be next? Are you waiting? Do you have to do something else, something like that? 

P5: I think it was pretty straightforward once I filled it out, kind of got the it's been submitted and someone would be contacting me shortly. So and it did. So it was pretty straightforward. 

Moderator: Okay, so some people, and this was something that people had to, were, were contacting you for. 

P5: Yes. 

Moderator: Okay, great.All right. So we are going to moving into a little screen sharing. Do you know how to share your screen with your zoom app? 

P5: I have done it before but uh 

Moderator: You just tap once on the screen at the bottom. There should be, you may have to scroll a bit to the left. There should be a share button. 

P5: Oh, there we go. Okay, I'm sharing the screen. I'm not sure if I... Okay, I did something else. 

Moderator: It's coming up. There we go. And if you want, you can move my video out of the way, kind of swiping it to the right a little bit if you want it. Might be easier to see everything.

Yeah, that's fine too. OK. I'm going to send you a link to the VA site. So we're not going to prototype yet. This is going to be the actual site. But also, I'm not going to have you fill anything out. So no information. OK, so if you go, oh, there we go. Yes, Emily to meeting group chat. So tap on that. We're just going to go to the VA site. 

P5: Can I have my screen, I'm trying to see where. 

Moderator: You just tap it, let's see, yeah, tap it once to bring up, oh, on the lower left, I can see a tiny row. Yeah, try tapping it again, just to get to the chat. Oh, there we go. Yep, yes, I know it's really tiny.

Yeah, click on the chat. Yep, there we go. And then just tap on that. Open up the VA site. There we go. So I'm not going to have you read everything because there is a lot of information there. This is more just skimming and getting a sense of how things are structured here. So let's say you are looking for information on preparing for your own burial. So skimming this page, I know in terms of information you'd be looking for, you had answered before that you want to know what will be covered. Yeah, thoughts on other information you might be looking for as you are skimming this page. And again, I want you to read everything because there is a lot here. 

P5: Let's see... Well, it looks to have a lot of information, kind of like some of the things that I've brought up, like find the cemetery records. Yeah. As I'm reading it, this is kind of some of the things that we were thinking about, how do we find the records? 

Moderator: Right, right, yeah. 

P5: So it's already there. 

Moderator: Yeah, okay. Yeah, so you said things are already there. Thoughts on how clear the information is here? And this is more if you are preparing for your own burial. 

P5: Right. Yeah, I think it does have a lot of good information. I guess, is there a search within this page? I mean, I know if you took the time to read it, you would probably find it. But is there an actual search, I guess, within that page? 

Moderator: Oh, so would that be something important to be able to search just within this section? 

P5: Right. Like, like, I know the information is there, but sometimes those pages that you'll have, if you start typing something, it'll just take you there. 

Moderator: Mm hmm. Okay, got other things specifically in regards to preparing for your own burial. Are there other things you might be looking for that you would help to find here besides what will be covered? 

P5: I guess for the question that I would have, because I would, again, I would want to know the cemeteries, which is there. There's a point of contact I saw down here. Then of course, how much that was there. There's actually even a burial schedule. So that just makes it easier to plan something, plan as well. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. 

P5: Just off the top of my head, I can't really think of anything else. Anything else from the top of my head, the allowance, so yeah. 

Moderator: Yeah, OK. So we're going to pretend that you have chosen to apply for the pre-need burial. Yeah, well, now I see at the top of the page there. Tap on that. Again, I'm not going to have you fill anything out, I promise. But if you can tap on the pre-need burial link. OK, so just super briefly here, are there other questions you would want answered that you would hope would be covered here? 

P5: Let's see… I think that's straightforward as the actual application. Okay. Yeah. Go ahead. If you scroll down, it takes you right there. 

Moderator: Okay. And if you were to choose, I know before you said you'd generally like to fill forms out on your phone, do you think it would be the same here? Would you choose to apply some other way? 

P5: Um, I mean, of course, if I was, if I was at a desktop, I would, I would apply there or like on a tablet, because now I know I have a couple of friends as well. You know, I have the phone that kind of like a tablet as well. So it just makes it it's like a little bit of having both. So. Yeah, that'd be, you know, I guess if I didn't if I didn't have like that type of mobile device, then then I probably would. I'd say that at a desktop if I had like a smaller phone, maybe. 

Moderator: Okay. And can you tell me what reasons you would have for going on a desktop instead? 

P5: If it was like a lot of information I had to fill out, sometimes it's, I know sometimes some apps don't, it'll look different. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. 

P5: So that would be like, if I was having, if I were having trouble moving forward on the mobile device, then I would move to the desktop. 

Moderator: Hmm, okay. 

P5: But if it was easy to fill out, then I will continue to use the mobile device. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. And then thoughts on how easy. So let's pretend you were maybe at least started on the mobile thoughts on how easy or difficult it will be to gather the information that is needed for this application. 

P5: How hard would it be to have that information? 

Moderator: to gather the information that you would need. 

P5: Um, yeah, I, yeah, I would say it wouldn't be a problem. Um, let's try to see. Yeah, yeah, it shouldn't be a problem at all. 

Moderator: Okay, so everything here that would not be a problem to apply on the phone. 

P5: Right. It shouldn't be, as long as you're able to, like, I have my DD214, I keep it saved in an electronic file on my phone as well.

Moderator: Okay, got it. 

P5: So if that was, like, I'm looking at it now, if I had to, if I'm able to attach it and paste it, or just attach it to, like, a mobile device application, then it shouldn't be a problem. 

Moderator: Okay, so you've got things set up already. Got it. Okay. I'm going to send you another link. So this next link will come up in Zoom. See if it comes up as a notification. It looks like you may need to switch back to your Zoom app. Yeah, there we go. That long link right there. So tap on that. So this will open up a prototype. Just a little bit slow. All right, there we go. So this is, I guess, a prototype. Nothing is real in here. This is a representation of the actual application as it may look on a phone. So I wanted to want to get a couple more thoughts on potentially filling it out on the phone. If I can have you scroll down and just go to the start the pre-need eligibility application. Okay, so scroll down a bit. So this, like I said, this is just a representation. So we've jumped ahead quite a few steps. Upload supporting files. Any further thoughts on now that you see what it might look like on gathering the required information? Originally you said it looked fairly easy. Just want to see if that is still the case. 

P5: It does look, it does look, look straightforward. So, and as long as it'll, I know sometimes mobile, sometimes the files won't, it could be the program too, but sometimes I think some things, if you don't have certain readers or something, or you're mobile, then that may be a, be a problem. But other than that, other than that, it should be straightforward. 

Moderator: OK, got it, great. All right, let me scroll down a little more and then click on the Submit button. OK, and then so this will we are pretending that you have already submitted. Congratulations. So we're just going to stay on this page for a moment. What would you be expecting the next steps might be now that you have just finished the application, sent everything off on your phone? 

P5: Yeah, once I hit submit, I would be hoping maybe like a confirmation email as well. 

Moderator: Got it. 

P5: And maybe like next steps, you know, what to other than the, you know, the receipt of the confirmation. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. 

P5: Okay, maybe like next steps 

Moderator: OK, do you want to go to the next steps? Got it. And I said confirmation you would want via email. How would you like to learn any next steps? 

P5: Probably like right under it, what to do next. For this, I mean, if you're trying to prepare, you know, for, well, hopefully it's not like a burial, like too soon, but if you just like it as of right now, trying to submit, is that what we're talking about? Just trying to apply for the pre-need? 

Moderator: Yes, correct.

P5: Okay, yeah, then I would just say like next, maybe next steps, what to do next. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. Got it. Yeah, go ahead. 

P5: or like maybe have like a time frame. 

Moderator: Okay. Got it. And how would you want the timeframe communicated? 

P5: Again, under the submit application, someone will be in contact with you within, I don't know, four or five days or that way I'm not just sitting here waiting, you know, I don't know if they're going to be in contact with you today or in the next couple of weeks. 

Moderator: Okay, so you'd want to somehow be told when the next time you'd be contacted. 

P5: Right, just like this is sometimes a timeframe I can just look forward to it's like, okay, you know, I have a two or three days or I have a week to somewhat contact me that way, you know. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. And so now we're going to jump ahead in time again in our pretend timeline here, saying that your application has been processed and a decision has been made. So again, the two decisions are yes, you are eligible, or no, you are not eligible. Talk to me about how you would expect to be notified that the decision has been made. 

P5: If it's an app, maybe notifications, email. I know when I have a message from a provider, I will get an email or maybe a text message to say to check my VA. 

Moderator: Okay, something tells you go, so go and check your VA, get it?

P5: Right. I have a message or something. 

Moderator: Okay. And then in terms of the information and how would you want to access it overall? So you said you wanted to find it within your VA account. Any other way you might want to find the information or to have access to the information? 

P5: You mean once it's been approved? 

Moderator: Correct, yes, once it's been decided. 

P5: I'll be hoping for a link. The link, okay. The way it was probably taking me somewhere. I just maybe had to have the site in and my information should be there. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. And then any thoughts on in terms of sharing, sharing with other loved ones, who may be in charge of your burial thoughts on how you'd want them to have the information. 

P5: That's a good point. Maybe set up an attachment, kind of like, I saved my DD 214. Maybe it's something that could be forwarded or easily attached to forward it to family members that have it. 

Moderator: Okay, something that you would be able to send to them. Got it. And then any thoughts on support that you might want from the VA in terms of communication. 

P5: I would just say I think the best thing would be like that email link or that link to click on. That way it just makes it, I think it would just make it easier with the information and then kind of like we talked about earlier, maybe somehow within your information is something that we know that is already filled out, that is already done. So this is something that's attached to your name. 

Moderator: Okay, so something, yeah, attached to you, got it. Okay, let me have you scroll down to the bottom here on this screen here, a little more, and tap on the continue.And then we'll go, so let me go, have you go to the pink, go to my VA. So a fake portal for someone named Sammy. Since you've talked about you'd want the information of the pre-need decision within your account, any further thoughts on where that might be, what might make sense in terms of, excuse me, in terms of you finding it later. 

P5: I would say kind of like in that benefit section I was talking about way earlier in that verification letter that has all the information, I think it would just be really easy to navigate. That way you're not really digging for it, it's just right there. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. And then similar question, but in terms of any updates, so we talked about the timeline before where you would want to know, hey, how long is it going to be till someone reaches out to me. Thoughts on any of that communication here within VA, if that would be helpful or not? 

P5: As far as that's online? 

Moderator: Mm-hmm, yeah. 

P5: Um, I think, I guess if you build it out, maybe it's something that says, uh, completed this and awaiting, um, communication or something like that. That way it kind of shows that, that you did do it or that you did fill out the application. 

Moderator: Oh, okay. 

P5: So it kind of has this application for benefits. 

Moderator: Hmm. Okay. Thoughts on how important it might be for you to always know the status and to know the timeline. 

P5: I think it's very, very important, especially, you know, if you actually took the time to fill that out. Yeah, yeah, I think that's extremely important just to know, just to get it just to get it taken care of. Yeah, I think it's one of those things that, again, I think most people don't plan for. And so I think if you do take that time out to kind of to do that, and I think it's one of the things that can be easily forgotten. 

Moderator: Mm hmm. So, okay, so you would you would want to, to be to be kept up, it sounds like with the with the status is, okay, got it. And then any question I've already asked, but now that you're looking at this, we talked about like once a decision has been made, and let's say you are eligible, you talked about wanting to maybe text or email someone the final information, any thoughts on how that might look within this page here, like like a final letter, for example. Excuse me. 

P5: Yeah, I would just, I would just say maybe it'll just be like his own little section. And kind of said that just maybe just like this, you know, burial benefits are and they have maybe maybe I don't know if it was a burial instructions or reworded some other way. That way it just makes it, you know, it just makes it easier. The way that something you can click on, kind of like the review details here, you can click on something already fed up and it's easy, you can attach it and send it. 

Moderator: Yeah, so provide a pretty easy way to send it on to whoever you want. 

P5: Right. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. And then for any further thoughts on anything you might want the VA to do, let's say after you pass in terms of making sure everyone else has that information. 

P5: I guess maybe the VA, of course, the VA finds out before certain family members, I guess, I don't know, I don't know if that, you know, meets something that a VA they could do but maybe have points of contact with the VA. 

Moderator: Okay. Okay. Yeah, that's fine. Maybe scroll down to the bottom.

There's going to be one more link we're going to go to. So now the yellow go to VA app. And so this is a... We're pretending this is... Can you scroll down a little more? That's fine. Yeah, no, that's fine. Yeah, thoughts? So this is, of course, a pretend app here. So same questions as asked before. Thoughts on if you were looking for updates, since we just talked about that, would there be a place within the app you might want to have that information in terms of while it's still being processed? So it's like the timeline and status, as we discussed. 

P5: You sent in any of their places on there as far as. 

Moderator: Yeah, so same question as we were asking before, but this time just on the app. Thoughts on would the app be a place you might go for or would want to go for information on where the application is in terms of the timeline and status? 

P5: Oh, okay. I guess maybe under messages or claims, maybe they'd be like a pending claim. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm, okay. 

P5: Maybe in that area. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. And then the second question is of once the decision has been made, and we talked about the, there being like a letter or something you'd want to forward on. Would that be something you would, you might want to keep in the app as well? 

P5: Yes 

Moderator: Yeah, OK. Thoughts on where that might be? 

P5: I would say probably in that veterans status, because there's a whole breakdown in there. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. 

P5: Yeah. Or maybe even spot on his face like an extra, you know. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. 

P5: Yeah, yeah, probably on the better of standard. 

Moderator: Uh-huh, okay, yeah, that makes sense. Okay, I think those are all my questions. I'm gonna check in with my team here. Type. Is there anything else that you might like to share about the burial benefits that you have not already shared? 

P5: Um, I guess I don't have anything that, uh, that, uh, I want to share this for. Yeah. 

Moderator: Okay. Yeah, nothing. 

P5: Nothing personal, I guess. 

Moderator: Yeah. All right. Let me just and Natasha, Carly, Brandon, Brian, sorry. If there's anything that you thought of you'd like to ask, you can unmute yourself and ask now if you so choose. Okay. I'll take that as a no.

So just want to, excuse me, goodness. I want to confirm once again, now that you've, we've had the whole conversation, are you still comfortable with us potentially sharing a clip from today's session? Again, with your identifying information removed? 

P5: I am. 

Moderator: Okay, great. Thank you very much. But that is all we have. I really appreciate you taking the time. This is always extremely helpful to talk with, with veterans directly about what they want, what their experiences are to help us build better products, make things, make things better for everyone. So I know that Perigean is going to be sending, sending you a thank you note, having a little blurb, you can pass on to other veterans who might want to help participate in these research studies. But that is all we have for today. So I appreciate your time. And I hope you have a great rest of your day. 

P5: Thank you very much. I really appreciate the opportunity. 

Moderator: All right. Thank you. Take care. 

P5: Thank you. 

Moderator: Thank you.
