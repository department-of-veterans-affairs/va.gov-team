# P10

[Moderator] : Yup. So to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

[P10] : Yes, that's fine.

[Moderator] : Okay, great. And are you okay? If we use any clips just from this session to share with our Va partners.

[P10] : Yes, that's fine as well.

[Moderator] : Okay. Great. Okay. Now to the actual discussion. So first, st I'd love to know just a little bit about you as a veteran, what branch of the military did you serve? And when did you retire or separate.

[P10] : I was active duty from 1982 to 1990. [REDACTED]

[Moderator] : Yeah.

[P10] : my last 6 years I was either a member of, or at the end of my time in the Air Force. I was [REDACTED - job title], or out of a 365 day year 377, were what we call details.  : and the majority of those being funerals.

[Moderator] : No.

[P10] : So I've literally literally buried over a thousand people in my military career.

[Moderator] : So, wow, all right. Well, you have a lot of experience in that. In that case.  : Yes.  : so in and so, and then talk to me about any sort of involvement do you have had with the Va. Both past and currently.

[P10] : The past very little, nothing at all, while while we were active duty. And  : I didn't even step foot on any Va campus until 2019, when one of my therapists insisted I should try to get disability  : for mental issues, that I was getting full social security disability for.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay, got it?  : Okay? So you've been to facilities since then. How about any use of the Va website or the app.

[P10] : The website almost daily. The app. I loaded it up last night just to see what it, you know, looked like in the difference.  : So that's it. That's as far as I got. I've also been in usability studies about the retooling of some of the Va. You know. Website stuff, too.  : Oh, okay, got it.

[Moderator] : There's no that got it. So you said you are on the Va website daily. What? What are you doing on the website?

[P10] : Mostly trying to track prescriptions or get prescriptions. Make sure appointments and everything are up to date.  : just not.  : Yeah. Like, I said. I have to have to micromanage my own life, because I do have add, as part of my whole package of you know, stuff.

[Moderator] : Okay.  : got it? Got it? Okay? So you're on there on the website, daily, is that on your computer? Is that on a phone  : computer, 99.9 9% of the time. Like I said, the only time last night, it's like one of the only times I've loaded through website on the phone or the app on the phone.  : Okay, and talk to me about why? Why, why, most of your Va website usage is on the computer.

[P10] : I've been a techie since the late eighties.  : I,  : well, president of computer, local computer user groups back in the day when that used to be a thing, and I went from working, you know, being on Bbs's. I was crawling the world Wide Web before there was a world wide web  : when it was the old Internet using unix and links and stuff like that to get from place to place. Bounce files all over the place from the libraries and whatnot. I had an a plus. I went to get out of aerospace because I saw it as being very detrimental to my health and mental state.  : So I proceeded to get an a plus certification  : for computer repair in 1998  : I've been mostly self taught. I've only had one class in my entire life, and I trust my  : capabilities on a desktop better than I trusted on Android or apple phones.

[Moderator] : Oh, okay, can you say more about that? Of why? Why you trust the capabilities more on the  : on the.

[P10] : I know. I know when my VPN is working. I can track. I can watch what's going around where it's going around. I can. You know, I use a security key to log in on my desktop  : and into the into the Via website, because now they get the you know, this new secure login and stuff. And yeah, you can spoof phone numbers and stuff and get around that real easy. But you can't get past that key. I don't have one. It's supposed to work with phones, too. But I need to just get another one strictly for using with my phone. So if I have to go that route.  : But yeah, I've been very play.  : I used to write horror, dark fantasy back in the nineties before I had my mental break, and my thing was being as realistic as possible, and get things concisely told.  : And so I may talk forever in 2 days. But when you read something I'm writing.  : the knife is gonna drag across the bone really quick. And it's gonna get to the point.  : you're going to feel that that the visceral, whatever.  : and I can do that on the computer better than I can a phone, because I can't even find you know the the file system just just totally lose me on on the phone, even though I have rooted them and done rootkits on them and all that stuff in the past. But yeah, I just really  : I don't know. I trust desktops. I trust my abilities here.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. And yeah, you said, maybe there's was point O, 1% of time you are on the phone on the Va site. What is that minuscule amount of time? What? At at what point are you on the phone? On the Va site?

[P10] : Just last night.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. Okay.

[P10] : That was it that I don't use it other than that.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? Got it?  : Okay? So we're going to talk about overall benefits that you are entitled to as a veteran. Do you recall. What ways have you learned about what benefits are available to you over the years.

[P10] : It's been a very slow process.  : The opening for Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The filing cabinet in the basement, guarded by the panther really describes how you find out things about the Va. Or somebody within the system telling you, Hey.  : you need this done. This is how you do it.  : But there's no site that tells you how to do this. There's nowhere that. Oh, it's Dd gov blah blah blah blah! And I have to dig for it for 3 days, and the frustration level just goes through the roof, and I'd prefer to.  : I'd prefer to stick my head in a wood chipper.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?  : Have there been any resources that you have found to be helpful for learning about your benefits?

[P10] : And typically social workers.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P10] : Became homeless in 2019. I've been exclusively using the Va. Since then.  : I finally got into a place and stable, not because of the Va. But because the Va. Just really even their social workers in the system didn't really help me do anything.  : Their communication was sporadic.  : The the secure messaging is a joke. I have a primary care, doctor. I can't even send a message to. I have to call some guy on a Tuesday, or whatever to have him added to my list of message. If if it's permitted.  : You know, I understand the need for security and everything but the frustration. Just. I'm pretty much just okay. No, I'll walk away.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay, got it. Okay? So you learn largely from a social worker. It sounds like.

[P10] : Oh, yeah.

[Moderator] : And then and then specifically for burial benefits. So you've already stated, you've done what 1,000 or 8, many benefit or  : yes, over over a thousand  : over a thousand. All right. Do you recall? And I'm sorry was that while you were

[P10] : Duty.

[Moderator] : That was okay while you actually got it.  : How about any  : Any additional benefits to to veterans? Do you recall where you might have heard, like what what people are eligible for after they

[P10] : Not much.  : I didn't even look at the Va. For any  : like I said any assistance or anything until 2019, when I tried to file so.  : I know that I do have a plot of land back in [REDACTED] with my name on it and a cemetery.  : but it's 1 of those places. I wouldn't want to be buried if I was going to be buried. To begin with.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay.  : Got it. Thoughts on where you might like to see any burial benefits mentioned that either might be helpful to you or might be helpful to anyone.

[P10] : It  : when I started look trying to look it up online. And I went to the to the website on my desktop  : it, you gotta kind of tap dance around a bit. And things, you know are kind of jinky.  : Yeah, I understand they're they're running things a certain way that you've got to select the State, know? What are you trying to do? What are you trying to find? And whatever? And  : even on the website, I changed the state to see what was the. You know what cemeteries were open and stuff, and it just  : I had to reselect things like what I was looking for, and you know, did did.  : I couldn't just change one factor in the search and not have it.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P10] : Refresh.

[Moderator] : Yeah.

[P10] : I had to go through the whole thing all over again.  : and that's a lot of things I've seen with even the ova site.

[Moderator] : Okay, that's yeah, I agree that does sound frustrating got it.  : so well, it's funny, my next question, is have you been involved in the planning of anyone's funeral. So we've already discussed. Yes, I guess  : So outside of the over a thousand that you've already mentioned. How about any planning of funerals for people that you had known more personally? I guess I should say.

[P10] : 0.  : 0. Okay. Got it.  : too much about it from the other side. That I, you know, but also all my family lives in Memphis, and I live in Atlanta.

[Moderator] : Got it okay.  : and tell me about any thinking or planning you've done for your own wishes. I know you've mentioned. You're the plot of land in [REDACTED]. Was it  : one of the M. States.

[P10] : Correct.  : Sorry. Okay. Yeah. What sort of planning slash thinking have you done?  : I I have a friend that she's a debt she works in, you know.  : end of life planning. She does a lot of death. Talk a lot of, you know. End of life. Do a lot of, you know, work and stuff.  : She's very death positive and trying to to get a lot of things, you know, I guess, put out there. And I really haven't thought about, because I just want to sign on the line and donate it to science. But now I'm seeing all these things of oh, they took the body, and they chopped it up, and they're giving it to such and such here and such and such there. And  : yeah, I'm pretty much bring me under a tree somewhere. But at the same time it's like, you know. The only thing I have is a record other than this stuff on the Internet is my time in service.

[Moderator] : Hmm.

[P10] : So, you know, I remember when we used to do graveside services in the locations we would go to  : and  : where we stationed was in New Jersey, and we covered all of New Jersey as far west as Harrisburg and as far north as Connecticut, which meant  : we covered the most populated area in the free world.  : And a lot of times there were national cemeteries that we would do normal, you know.  : going out to. And you know.  : And then things started changing. They started having these little areas where we would go to that they would do the service, and then the casket would be wheeled off and they'd be buried somewhere, not where the we did the service.  : 6 and one half dozen the other. It wouldn't bother me if there wasn't even a service, but you know  : a supply. I can come and get.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay, do you? Any recollection of what? Prompted you to just start considering  : what you might want, if you know, if if anything, as you stated.

[P10] : nobody lives forever.

[Moderator] : I mean anybody here. Everybody's fooling themselves, you know.

[P10] : We're we're lucky we survived a lot of the things we have, even if you're you're young and in the civilian sector and never touched foot in the military.  : I don't know. I I guess I  : confronted my mortality a long time ago, but  : I have [REDACTED - medical issues].  : So there's a lot of things going on. And  : you know, as I say, I could wake up dead tomorrow like you're gonna wake up when you're dead.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P10] : But.

[Moderator] : Yeah.

[P10] : So yeah, just facing the the numbers. I've always been an odds person, you know, know the odds of what you're dealing with and work accordingly.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?  : And have you started to have any discussion or set things aside for like laying out particular wishes for those around you, or those those.

[P10] : The closest family member I have is my little sister, and  : you don't want to talk about none of that stuff.

[Moderator] : All right.

[P10] : So I know this is something I'm gonna have to do on my own and have things documented, things filed. And  : so it's gonna be a process.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? Got it?  : So we're going to discuss a specific benefit, the pre-need burial benefit. First, st are you aware of that specific one.

[P10] : No, not completely. Just a little bit. I saw on the  : the web page. Yeah, I think.

[Moderator] : Okay. Do you? Do you recall at all anything that about it? If not, I'm about to tell you what it is but wondering if you've.

[P10] : No, no, nothing. I just saw the name.

[Moderator] : Got it. Okay? Yeah. So the pre-need eligibility benefits might be switching some words around. There is an application that you would do to determine or to find out if you are eligible, to be buried in a Va. National cemetery, and it's good like the veteran themselves can do it.  : Also can be done for spouses and some other family members. And so it's a way of seeing, you know the term pre-need as a funeral home  : term meaning before the time of need before before you're dead.  : So it's a way to see if you are indeed eligible to be buried. If that is something that you want. And so, once you put in the application, once a decision has been made, a letter comes back with either. Yes, you are eligible or no, you are not eligible, and maybe here's why or here are some next potential steps.

[P10] : Okay.

[Moderator] : So now that I've explained a little bit about that. Any I I know we've talked about like, you know, making sure you wanted wanted to have things in order, but any thoughts on  : Why, that might be useful, important, interesting. Any of the above.

[P10] : Given the number of suicides by veterans and stuff. Most of us just want to check out.

[Moderator] : Hmm,

[P10] : And but having helped  : other friends clean up after suicides and such, it's always the people that are left behind that suffer. So, taking all that out of their hands. They don't have to do making decisions. No, no extra step of anything. Yeah, that's my mindset on it, just, you know, and also  : what I want done will be done.  : My grandmother did that completely.  : She died of a heart attack at her kitchen sink. Washing dishes wouldn't found for 2 days.

[Moderator] : But it was her own home.

[P10] : And everything. She had the dress picked out that she was going to be buried in the coffin, everything, the flowers she wanted on it, and nobody got to say a damn word about any of it, and I thought that was just the most awesome thing at the time.  : That was her completely at her core. She was our pasty, she was, she was our matriarch.

[Moderator] : Got it with with your grandmother, do you? So, since you said she had laid everything out, do you recall how that had been communicated to those around her.

[P10] : The closest one to her was 1 1 of my aunts, not my mother. My mother.  : I won't say my family's dysfunctional. We just all. We're all broken in different ways. I'm a lot like my mother in certain ways to where I don't feel love. I don't understand it.  : but she and my grandmother said she never could love her. She couldn't reach her. So my other aunt.  : the eldest next eldest, took over for you know, for things like this, and she made her wishes well known in advance that this was this, this was this, this, and this she even wrote notes off to the side. Give this kid this much money, this kid, you know, all of them equal and such and such, has already gotten this.  : So you know people bicker over little things that don't mean anything, but you know they shouldn't have to bicker over anything at all when when something like this happens, because that really screws up families.

[Moderator] : Yeah, yeah, okay, got it.

[P10] : We all knew what she had already written in stone, and you know that was it.

[Moderator] : Yeah. Got it. Okay?  : So very, very clear. Cut. All right. So with the the pre- need burial benefit.  : Any thoughts on what questions you might want, answered regarding that.

[P10] : know that they're not doing it. I don't think they're doing it yet. I didn't like people I'd like to know about biodegradable options.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P10] : don't really care what kind of casket is. I don't really care. I'm like, I'm gonna be supervising.  : I have seen literally. I have seen solid oak baskets and stuff at some elaborate funerals that we did over the years.  : Up the steep steps into a church. They weigh a ton. The middle ones are so much nicer to carry.  : and it was a lot.  : No, I really won't hang on other than that. I I'd like to be able to see what their their process is gonna be. And that's about it.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P10] : You know I don't  : like, I said. And and is it I can't remember what comedian said, and you asked the question, what happens after you die. Oh, lots of things, but it doesn't concern me because I'm dead.

[Moderator] : Yes.

[P10] : I kind of feel that way.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it.  : So with again going with returning to the pre-need I mentioned earlier. When you do apply a decision comes back, either. Yes, you are eligible to be buried in National Cemetery or no, you're not, and that does come in a former of a letter.  : Thoughts on like what you would want to be able to do with that letter to make sure that it gets to the right people. It it serves to be useful once  : once you have passed.

[P10] : I understand the the need for the paper documents and stuff, but this is the most ridiculous thing that the Va. Still does. I get postcards for appointments that that are gonna happen in 2 days. How long did it take you to send out? How much did you spend on, you know that's a cost cutting thing.  : The letter comes. It's another thing I have to keep track of and keep secure. And oh, my God, if it gets destroyed. You gotta you gotta fight the panther down in the basement to get that filing cabinet.  : So it's it's kind of ridiculous. It just needs to be something.  : you know. Documentation wise. That's an annotated somewhere that can be referred to. But of course they need their paper trail  : and.

[Moderator] : Got it so that, like so much, so much paperwork everywhere. What would be ideal if not A physical paper letter.

[P10] : I thought it was neat that when I signed on in the the  : I tried going on to some of the Va. Web apps before on my phone  : when I was in between places and everything, and  : it was just the most convoluted Bs I had ever seen. And I thought, this is just pretty normal  : with the last update, I guess, and the new rollout at the beginning of the year.  : I hadn't even tried the new new Va. App. But the 1st thing it did was it showed me what my disability rating was and how much I was getting, and all this type stuff it should be able to be tied to that account just like that. So anybody needs that information. It's all right. There.

[Moderator] : Pardon me.

[P10] : Yeah.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P10] : Didn't do anything.

[Moderator] : Oh, yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.

[P10] : Having things like that, having a copy of your Dd. 214 stored. Have a copy of your birth certificate stored, you know these are. These are the beneficial things that that vets kind of need. It's 1 thing to carry your own paper records and have them secure someplace.  : but at least having it through a government agency, could say, Yep, that's him, that's all his paperwork. We we verified it. There's no more questions about it, and it could be just another 5  : Kilobyte file in there.  : That's the letter. 2.  : What I am entitled to, and whatnot. And you know.

[Moderator] : Yeah. Okay. So so something that the that the Va would have would be holding on to that doesn't involve paper.

[P10] : Well, if they send out a paper thing to have that as a backup for events, you know, having a single source for everything.  : No, it's just like that. That 80 million dollar Bitcoin wallet.  : you know, guys wanting to tear apart a garbage dump over in the Uk because he lost the the code to get into it.

[Moderator] : Hmm,

[P10] : There's no way to crack it. But he lost it. Oh, well, sorry you're out of luck.  : Yeah. You lose the original letter. Okay, you're now out of luck. Wait! Oh, you gotta beg for another copy, because that's what it always feels like with anything at the Va. That you're begging for them to do something.

[Moderator] : Okay. So you want to skip all that and just make sure they like it's it's easy for the Va. To.

[P10] : Becomes a non issue. Yeah.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? And then  : any any. Would. Would there be any other way that you? You would want to have access access to this to this letter.

[P10] : I mean, if I got a copy, the 1st thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna scan it.  : I'm gonna upload. I'm gonna keep a keep it on a flash drive somewhere that I know that in my where I have my my official documents and stuff so that I always have a copy I can look at, if nothing else.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay.

[P10] : I think that things on my PC. That's fine. I know that they're there, but I can delete, you know, delete that crap really easily by accident. One day.  : Same can happen anywhere else but having any official documentation coming from a government source, there should be a way to store it just in case I mean, just to me it seems like a no brainer.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay, got it? So outside of any sort of like burial forms, applications, have you filled out forms which is very broad question through through the Va.

[P10] : Forms for the Va. Oh, God! I filed for disability a couple of times. I've been turned down every time

[Moderator] : There is applicable.

[P10] : So yeah, there's always yeah, that that's that's about it.

[Moderator] : Got it? Okay.  : have these? Have these been online paper? How have you filled them out in the past?

[P10] : Both.

[Moderator] : Both. Okay, got it. For the online.  : I know you've already talked about. You do everything on on desktop. So I'm just assuming, just confirm you. You did not fill out any on your phone.

[P10] : No, no.  : If I have to do, I have to do something more than that, more than you know making it. I use my phone for phone calls. Basically that's it.

[Moderator] : Okay, great so with, let's say, the last time you were you were filling out a form online. What was your experience like after you completed it. Like waiting for any next steps that might be might be coming.

[P10] : Frustration a lot of times.

[Moderator] : Hmm.

[P10] : There's a there's a  : there seems to be it didn't.  : There always seems to be the odd nomenclature as to how the Va. Operates on stuff and whatnot.  : you know. Oh, I need to get an allergy medicine. Oh, well, our formulary doesn't carry that allergy medicine. You get the generic one that we give everybody.  : But that one doesn't work for me. Well, sorry. This is what you get.  : Okay.  : they don't tell you there's a recourse. They don't tell you, you know they they oh, you can file if if you if it's a determination.  : or you're filing for disability, and and you know a rating or something.  : and the Va. Says, You know you, you find out that. Okay, it's been declined because it's only through a letter that they'll tell you this, and then then you can go online, and then you can find out. Oh, it was declined. But they won't tell you why.  : So you're left in the dark about? Okay? What part of you know? Missing arm did not meet the the requirement. You know. How did this? Not, you know, match up? And anytime that I filled something out online with the Va. It's always like, well, did it actually go someplace.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay.

[P10] : I mean, the messaging is just trash.  : I went without my main, my main psych med for over a month.

[Moderator] : No luck.

[P10] : Because I didn't. I couldn't contact anybody that was related to the site team or my primary care doctor to have it relate.  : The system told me. Oh, you call this number, and you punch in the number and and the system says, you know your refill has been requested.  : The system didn't tell me that. No, you don't have any refills on this. We can't authorize a refill it has to be. You have to contact the doctor to actually do so. For several weeks I thought that I had something in the works that no, no, and with the change it doesn't tell. You can track your medications being shipped.

[Moderator] : Oh, okay.

[P10] : And when I and I finally got to A to, I know this isn't directly related, but it's just the frustration level of how things don't match up.  : Yeah, if I have something, I drop off a prescription at Kroger, I can go online.  : It says it's waiting.

[Moderator] : It says it's projected to be filled at 5 o'clock by 5 o'clock.

[P10] : And if it's not filled by 5 o'clock it'll update and tell me.  : No, I don't have transportation, so I had to have everything shipped to me. But there is nothing on there that says, expect it, and you know.  : just medications. And it's like a lot of these things really matter.  : And but  : as far as form wise, it just a lot of it feels useless, you know. Fill out a survey. Oh, yeah.  : never!  : No, don't send me one in the mail. Don't talk to me. You know what you know you've already. If you don't know what veterans already think you shouldn't be asking.  : That's right. But go ahead.

[Moderator] : Let me.  : Okay, so yeah, so sounds like, you are not happy with, just status updates in general, of what? Yeah, what? What, exactly is going on. You want to know? More of that information.

[P10] : Yeah, it's all it's like, all double secret squirrel stuff.

[Moderator] : Doubles. Oh, I like that double double secret squirrel.

[P10] : Yeah.

[Moderator] : Have to do that.

[P10] : I stole the double secret probation from Animal House and changed to secret squirrel, since it makes it seem spy like.

[Moderator] : So long. I'm okay. We're gonna do a little screen sharing do you know how to share your screen from the zoom?

[P10] : Not a clue.

[Moderator] : All right. Well, let's walk through it. So tap on the screen, and at the bottom there should be some menu items, one of which should should say, share  : with a little arrow.

[P10] : Start. Video here. Oh, there we go here.

[Moderator] : And then share screen.

[P10] : And there we go.  : Start new.  : Yeah.

[Moderator] : Just take a moment to start up.  : Is he giving you any messaging yet? I'm not seeing anything yet.

[P10] : All I'm seeing is the appears on top message.  : and I don't know what it wants me to do.

[Moderator] : Oh, is the like displaying over other apps permission.

[P10] : Yeah, yeah, parent operation.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P10] : So an app to show.

[Moderator] : Okay, yeah. So you'll zoom yes, like, zoom.  : I forget it. Yeah. So you'll select zoom. And then I believe you have to go back to the zoom app  : to share again.

[P10] : Okay, this is jumping through.  : Okay?  : Oh, that's wild.

[Moderator] : Alright lovely. It worked. Okay, cool. And if you want, you can swipe away my picture at the top just to have a little bit more space, it should go off to the side.  : Yeah, alright. There we go, safe driving mode. Perfect. Okay. I am going to send you a prototype link.  : The let's see, you may have to.  : Can you get to your met to the the chat within? Zoom, you might have to swipe to the middle, but it looks like you're on the left hand.  : Screen. Yeah. So right there, get the chat at the bottom.

[P10] : Everybody read that figma.

[Moderator] : Yep, we are, or opening up. Yes, opening up a browser with figma.  : So go ahead, tap on that alright that is opening. Give that a moment to go  : apply for premium eligibility. Determination.  : Yeah. So this is a prototype of just a couple of screens of this pre-need eligibility.  : So first.st See, I don't think this has any information about it. Scroll down to the bottom of this page.

[P10] : For me to start the application.

[Moderator] : Yep. So we're gonna pretend that once you tap on that, that you have jumped ahead to step 6 already, just because we've only used. I've only put a couple of screens on here.  : So this is the the uploading, supporting documents, page and acknowledging that you've already said you don't like to do forms on your phone. We're still going to pretend that you are trying  : on your phone?  : thoughts on, or I guess, have have you done any sort of uploads on your phone in the past where you've had to upload and like pictures of you have not.  : Okay. Yeah.  : Thoughts on how difficult or easy does this look from here.

[P10] : Okay, it tells the file types, size restrictions.  : Can I mail or fax files preparing application? Resume?  : Seems pretty straightforward.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?  : And do you? So your  : Dd, 2, 14. I've already forgotten. If you said you had, do you have regular access to that. Do you know where it is? Yeah.

[P10] : Arm's reach. I live in a 10 by 14 room, so everything's within arm's reach.

[Moderator] : It is, it is there? I got it. Okay.  : so it sounds like that would be and and and have you? Oh, you said you had not done any any upload?  : but yeah. But looking at at the guidelines here, how how do you think that would be getting the the 2 14 to them. Within this application.

[P10] : I don't know if they would allow a scan, but it sounds like they could.  : I know that a billion different apps nowadays allow you even Banks, you can deposit checks by scanning them with your phone. So  : if that's not an option, then I have to figure out a way to get it from  : wherever I may have it stored to my phone, or give my phone access to where it may be stored. If I actually have one on the cloud.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? Okay?  : So it sounds like it would be a few steps then.

[P10] : Yeah.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it all right. Let me go ahead and have you click the submit button on the lower right, pretending that you are submitting this finished application.

[P10] : Okay, submit your application, receive confirmation email shortly.

[Moderator] : So here we have. We've pretended that you have filled out the application. And this is the screen you get to. So we're just gonna pause here for this one. What would you be expect now that you have filled out this application? What would you expect? The next steps would be.

[P10] : There's never a timeframe given, so just when you submit it.  : So you know an expectation of now to infinity is all we can get.

[Moderator] : Hmm,

[P10] : Got a number I can track. If there's a way to track it.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P10] : I'm using a print app to print to my my printer. I can do it from the phone, supposedly, but  : says it's been submitted, and that's all I can do.

[Moderator] : Okay. So you you would want a a rough timeframe to know on this page.

[P10] : Or a way to track it. Accordingly.

[Moderator] : Okay, way to track it. Okay? Got it.

[P10] : Yeah.

[Moderator] : And  : how, since you mentioned the tracking, how important would that be to you to track the status of this application.

[P10] : It would be nice.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P10] : I mean just the the difference between oh, I've sent it out into the ether now, will the gods ever get back to me?  : Because that's what it always kind of feels like.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P10] : You know there's no given timeframe. There's no.  : and I know that the manpower is just insanely short. But yeah, hey.  : Knowing that you know the queue time is, you know, and I call for tech support  : through a company you know your number 14 in line expected. Wait. Time is 20 min. Okay.  : you know, for 20 min I can tap, dance, or do something, but.

[Moderator] : Okay? So you want, you have more information on just how long you think you'll be waiting. And and you mentioned the the tracking event.  : Okay.

[P10] : Yeah.

[Moderator] : Any any thought on the how often you might want to track it to see what the status of the application is.

[P10] : If I  : most of the I don't know somebody. If I knew that the average turnaround time was 2 weeks, say.  : and after 2 weeks. I hadn't heard anything. I'd like to know that I got an update, that oh, we're we're backlogged, or whatever you know. But given the fact that there's no way to tell what the turnaround time is or the wait time.  : you know. Okay, I've submitted this. Bob's been dead for 6 months. So when we gonna hear about this.

[Moderator] : Hmm,

[P10] : Oh, that's a Congressman thing, really. Then why did I fill out an application.

[Moderator] : Okay, so yeah, so a little. So yeah, so it's like, tied to the anticipated wait time, then.

[P10] : Correct.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it, got it? And then so after you filled out the application, we're gonna jump ahead in our pretend timeline for when the decision has been made  : any, and I know we we already had a whole discussion on. You know they'd be sending something paper, but you'd want it officially with with the Va, you know. Actually, let's let's tap on. Continue before I ask that question.

[P10] : Certainly.

[Moderator] : I continue at the bottom, and then tap the go to my Va.

[P10] : Due to my Va.

[Moderator] : Claims and appeals, claims.

[P10] : Fishing.

[Moderator] : Yeah. So thoughts here on after the decision has been made. So you've got that eligibility letter  : any any thoughts. Now you're looking at this of where you might want to be able to access it.

[P10] : I get. This is an improvement, in a way, but  : I'd have to go back to see when I filed that thing to see what the is, is it? Some part of the claim shouldn't be. Part of the claim is part of claim compensation. It's not enough.  : Appointment is at the same date.  : It's kind of confusing.  : I get bills from the same day. Okay, supposedly, they paid me X amount. Okay, applications for educational benefits.  : There's having it on the homepage like this. I wouldn't know where to find it.

[Moderator] : You wouldn't. Okay, got it. Do you have any thoughts of like what might make sense in terms of where you might find the letter?

[P10] : It kind of sounds like it would be in claims.

[Moderator] : Okay,

[P10] : But to me, logically it would seem more relevant if it was put under benefits.  : You applied for this.  : So therefore, you know, but it's a benefit that every you know honorably discharged veteran that serves them, you know, whatever the requirements are that you know you apply, you either get it or you don't get it and boom, and it would be in the benefits of it. But.

[Moderator] : Hmm. Okay, it'd be good.

[P10] : Just me.

[Moderator] : Yeah, I guess I guess backing up  : would it make sense, provided it was in a convenient location in the my Va profile? Would it make sense at all for you to go to your profile, your your account, to find this letter.

[P10] : Yes, if there it'd be nice, you know. It's nice to tell us all this stuff when it comes up like this. Because, yes, okay, claim compensation received. They received it. What are they doing with it? No clue. Have an appointment, you know. Schedule for this date. Okay, that's cool. But  : what about, you know?  : Applied for the burial stuff? And this is again. We gotta do the maze thing.  : I'd have to go digging and digging and digging. I would forget  : after using it one time if I could go to my thing, you know. Go to one thing that's just you know me. These are the the things that have already been settled, you know. Not so much claims, but you know.  : or maybe a way to break it down into more user friendly law and language.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay, can you say more about.

[P10] : With the the verniculars that the Va. Does.

[Moderator] : Okay, is that is that something? That you've run into a lot. The the language.

[P10] : I'll take that. Everybody everybody wants their own special way of explaining something.

[Moderator] : Oh, okay. Okay.

[P10] : I'm a i'm a gamer, too.  : And there is nothing more satisfying for me to sit down to run a test, drive on a game, to give a review to a friend of mine. He was the President, Georgia Game Developers Association than to load up a game, and these people have decided to be so unique that all the controls are not what are typical in a game.

[Moderator] : Okay. Yep.

[P10] : You know where you use W. Asd for movement?  : Oh, no, we're gonna use. IJKL.  : Okay.  : the space bar is not jump. You gotta you gotta hit the the G key for jump. Okay, that's and I tell him I said, you know I find these very satisfying. He's like, why you can go back in. And just, you know, remap stuff. I said. No, because I uninstall them.  : because if they have to be that unique, they can be that unique.

[Moderator] : Just don't wanna use it.

[P10] : This is a guy putting 27 rivets through his head because he needs to express himself so uniquely. Okay, do that. That's you.  : I'm not going to play it.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay, got it. So the more more clarity with with communication overall and organization.

[P10] : You don't have to reinvent the the wheel every time to to get something across.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?  : So let me have you.  : scroll down to the bottom of the screen. We're gonna get to one more page  : and then click on the go to Va. App. We'll go to a pretend picture of what the app or the app sort of looks like I would say, so I know you. So you would. You had downloaded the app, or you had just looked at the website yesterday on your phone.

[P10] : I. I installed the current version yesterday on my phone.

[Moderator] : Okay? So thoughts on. Well, 2 things on seeing status updates for that pre- need application within the app. Would that be something that would be useful to you.

[P10] : Or a place for things that are active, not things that are, you know.  : Yeah.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay.

[P10] : Especially.  : you've got 2 cases in this people that are planning ahead and people that okay, things have went wrong and they're dead.

[Moderator] : So you've got family members trying to navigate the nomenclature of things, they have no clue about

[P10] : And we'll figure it out.  : But yeah.

[Moderator] : Having something that says active, whatever would tell, you'd be great

[P10] : You know these are open, these are active, these are closed. You can.  : But yeah, and this is a much cleaner version and feel than the other.

[Moderator] : Okay, great. And then how about for the decision letter? Would that be something you would find useful in an app.

[P10] : If it  : if it was tied to them sending. Yeah, we're gonna send the paper one. But yes, it would be if there was a way to access what the decision was within the app to see it.  : So oh, it should have been.  : Yeah, I live in Georgia. They put that new sorting facility, and shut down all the local places. And that was February a year ago.  : and I had something that was mailed within the city that didn't get to me for over 28 days.

[Moderator] : Hmm.

[P10] : So.

[Moderator] : So in in terms of just making sure that you have things.

[P10] : That's very difficult.

[Moderator] : Yeah. Have it at there. Got it? Would there be other reasons? You might want to have the letter with it with available within the app. Besides that, it would show up there faster.

[P10] : Permanence. Hopefully yeah. House fire. Oh, well, sorry.

[Moderator] : Oops!

[P10] : But you black, you backed up your phone, didn't you? Oh, yeah, okay. Just reinstall everything. Oh, there it is. It's in the app already. I don't have to do this. I just have to log in.

[Moderator] : Okay.  : Good.

[P10] : Password manager are your friends nowadays?

[Moderator] : again and then any. Now that we've looked at both pictures of the app and the profile on my va, any further thoughts on  : sending on, on making sure that relevant people, for lack of a better term, have that letter so that they would have the required information, for when when you do pass.

[P10] : If if that was the case, you know, if there was an option for that, that, you know, next of kin share with this share with next of kin. So with with, you know, Facebook has an option for memorializing your page after you're gone.

[Moderator] : And.

[P10] : My sister almost lost her mind when I told her I was putting her on that.

[Moderator] : Hmm.

[P10] : You're not going to die anytime soon. Yeah, look, you don't know where that truck's coming from.  : So yeah.  : just being able to say, Okay, I've done this. They get, they get access to it. And it's good.  : Yeah.

[Moderator] : Okay. So you mean, like. So putting the person's contact information, just wanna make sure I understand.

[P10] : Well, if you had the person's contact information, or it had to go to a funeral home, or it had to go to, you know a lawyer, or next to kin, or whoever you know, needs to help with your your final. You know internment.

[Moderator] : and so that would be, would that be a way that that you would send it to them or something within the app that they could be contacted.

[P10] : Most people.  : My sister likes to stick her head in the sand and ignore this stuff.  : Sending it to her now he would just, you know, I don't know.  : I think once the death happens, you know, being sent something that you know such and such has authorized you to do this, you know, for this.  : you know access to this, to understand this, think that's beneficial on the family side. There's the, you know, whoever's coordinating things.

[Moderator] : Hmm.

[P10] : So I think that would be  : a great win. Let me put it that way.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? Got it.

[P10] : Either either way, if you have the option to send it to them now, or have them have access to it. Once, you know. Death certificates been presented.

[Moderator] : Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Okay, great. Well, those are. We are just about at time. I'm just gonna check in with Natasha and Parker to see if either of them have any questions. Either of you. You're welcome to unmute now, and ask if you have anything.  Parker: None. For me! Thanks.  : Okay. Great.  : alright. So any anything else you'd like to share Rick in regards to burial benefits that you have not already shared.

[P10] : Not a lot if you've ever dealt with with burial or mortuary affairs in the military.  : The people that do it that do those things. They mostly didn't come in saying, Hey, I want to be part of this. You know, the funeral directors are one thing, and from the military side, you get a different perspective on it, because  : you know, we have to do it, and we have to go back to our normal lives every day.  : anything that actually helps streamline the military. You know the the Va stuff, for you know, pre, you know, past members and and upcoming generations always be beneficial.

[Moderator] : Thank you.

[P10] : See? Yeah. But you know again, reinventing the wheel each time. Oh, we're going to add an extra step to this because senators stop, please just stop.  : Yeah, this is by committee building something by committee. That's how you no.

[Moderator] : Okay, so, yeah, thanks makes sense. Alright.

[P10] : Good luck!

[Moderator] : Thank you. I just wanna since now that we've had the conversation and want to check in once again, are you still comfortable with us potentially using a clip from this with our Va partners.

[P10] : Certainly go for it.

[Moderator] : Great. Thank you very much. Well, we certainly appreciate you taking the time. This has been super helpful to hear. It's always helpful to hear directly from our veterans what their experiences, wishes, needs are. So thank you very much for taking the time. This is super helpful. I know Para Jean will be reaching out, sending a thank you note.  : and also letting you like. With a little blurb, you can pass along to other veterans who might want to help, but that.

[P10] : Okay.

[Moderator] : Us it it for us today, and I hope you have a great rest of your day.

[P10] : Cool. Thank you very much. I have a good day, too.

[Moderator] : Thank you, take care!

[P10] : And bye, bye.
