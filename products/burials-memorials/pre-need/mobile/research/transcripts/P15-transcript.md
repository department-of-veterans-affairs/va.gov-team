# P15

[Moderator] : Firm wants to.  : Just so that's on the record. So now that we're here, we just want to confirm. Are you comfortable? If I record today as we talk.

[P15] : Yes, you can.

[Moderator] : Okay? And also, are you comfortable if I potentially use any clips from this with our Va partners.

[P15] : Yes. No problem.

[Moderator] : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Okay, so first, st I'd love to know just a little bit about yourself as a veteran branch of military that you served, and when you retired or separated.

[P15] : I was in the US. Army from 1993 until 1998,  : I served 5 years in the army.  : This discharge has a general discharge and honorable. I have veterans benefits. When I left the service.  : Have additional benefits. Now I'm sorry. What else you want me to elaborate on again.

[Moderator] : No, that's totally fine. Yeah, that's good. Led into my next question of involvement with the Va, so you said, you have various benefits. Yeah, just a brief overview of just how you have interacted with the Va over the years.

[P15] : Initially, very limited interaction with the Va. When I separated there was you know.  : a medical review of my  : any of my injuries, so I have a a certain rate. Do. Should I discuss my ratings with you? Or is that.

[Moderator] : I don't. I don't need to know it. Certainly.

[P15] : Okay. So that had a certain rating. But after some time I  : I was reevaluated recently within, you know, a few years ago, and I was, provide additional benefits for my disability.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? Great?  : And tell me, do you use the website and or app of the Va, oh, yes, yeah. So  : okay.

[P15] : Quite often.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P15] : The va.gov website, as well as the Va. App.

[Moderator] : Okay, what sort of things? Since you said, you use it? Often what what sorts of things are you doing on both of these.

[P15] : Okay, I could track my Va compensation payments. I can track my appointments.  : I can confirm my appointments. I get text message about my upcoming appointments to confirm my appointments  : and on the website  : pretty much, it does the same thing. But it allows you to ask the Va questions. We click on, ask Va, and you can compose a question and then get a response back. In some time.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay.

[P15] : It's a little bit bigger to look at, but it also has a lot more things you could look at. It connects from the health.  : health appointment side as well as just the Va. Claim benefit side.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it and are there. So you mentioned a bunch of things that you do on on the app and then on the website? Are there specific times that you actively choose to use either the app or the website.

[P15] : Well, yeah, well, if I have my phone handy, I just  : I just log into my phone. If I'm at the computer  : and you know I'll log into on on the computer. I I really don't necessarily to check all the time. But I already know.  : Normally, I I get my benefits towards the end of month I just see when it's coming. And so but  : yeah, and also to communicate with the Va. I click on. Ask Va, and I'll compose a question.

[Moderator] : Hmm.

[P15] : About some outstanding issues.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. And that's that's only on the website. Is that correct? Or is that also on the app.

[P15] : I could not find a place where I could click on. Ask Va on my app.  : I don't kind of. I'm aware of.  : But that's 1 thing I find useful is clicking. Ask Va. And you would fill out your question, and that goes to a certain department.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?  : Alright. So you said, are there? I think you mentioned that like things are there's more, like it's it's larger on your on your computer. Are there other reasons that you might actively choose to be on your computer as opposed to your phone?

[P15] : Just based on convenience, depending what device I was close to.

[Moderator] : Okay, I got it.  : So then, so now we're going to go to. You know any any sort of benefits that you have learned about over the years. Do you recall how you originally learned what benefits you are entitled to.

[P15] : how to learn my benefits. I just really just go into Va website and click on benefits. If I remember.  : I mean, I just know what I'm entitled to, but I'm not, which is really my my compensation for disability. And and and  : I get medical coverage from the Va.  : So I was initially not sure if I get all the benefits I'm entitled to like, whether it be dental vision or health, but I am entitled to those.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay, got it.  : And so you say you're found finding most of that on the website. Are there any other resources that you have found helpful.

[P15] : If I wasn't unsure of something. I just use Google's web search. And now I'll type in, you know, whatever the search phrases.

[Moderator] : Okay, alright, and any any other method that you have learned about the benefits over the years.

[P15] : Besides sending an email to ask Va. No.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it.  : And then specifically about benefits related to burials. Tell me either what you already know. Or, again, if there's if you, if you recall, like, how you originally learned about those.

[P15] : It's Csv.  : I'm not sure or what complete benefits I'm entitled to.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P15] : Has required as burial coverage. I don't know.  : I still have not even got a chance to look into it.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P15] : No, I didn't.

[Moderator] : Okay, great.  : That's fine. And tell me about have you been involved in the planning of anyone's funeral before.

[P15] : Planning completely. No some of it. I I've gone to  : the passings of my relative, you know, not recently, but in the past, but minimally or part of it.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? And did you for the ones that you were at least somewhat involved? Did you know, ahead of time the deceased wishes for what they might want.

[P15] : No, it was not disclosed to me what my loved one wanted, for you know their burial, or there was not discussed.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it.  : and tell me about any thinking or planning on your own wishes, if if at all, that you might have had.

[P15] : Alright, so I'm sorry. Ask me that question again. What.

[Moderator] : Just thinking. Rather. How have you done any thinking or planning for your own wishes for a burial or funeral?

[P15] : I haven't planned anything.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P15] : I I may. I'm not sure how I want my to be. I guess  : my end result. Would it be burial or cremation? I'm not sure. I haven't decided yet.

[Moderator] : Okay, that's fine, all right. Any thoughts on what might prompt you to start, considering that.

[P15] : The only reason I may have considered thinking about. You know, my end of life  : planning would be if I started to have a serious medical condition.  : And and I I know that I may not have time left, but I don't have those.  : I don't have any of those concerns at this time.

[Moderator] : Okay, good  : and have you had any? Have there been any discussions among your family members really about about anyone's wishes for for a burial or funeral?

[P15] : In my family.

[Moderator] : Yeah.

[P15] : No what happened.

[Moderator] : No? Okay? Good.  : Okay. So we're gonna we're gonna discuss a a specific benefit to to veterans. It's called the the pre-need burial benefit. Is this something you might have heard of before.  : I have never heard of it before. No.  : got it all right. I will explain what it is. So pre need. It comes from the the funeral services industry, and it literally means before the time of need, time of need being when you you have passed. And so it's.  : It is an application to determine if you are eligible, to be buried in a Va. National cemetery, and this is something that veterans can apply for, and also apply for various family members. I know spouse, and in some cases children as well.  : So that's what. Excuse me.  : that's what that is so. Now that I've just did a brief introduction of that. Any thoughts on where you might expect to find information like that.

[P15] : I'm gonna guess this, the va.gov website, maybe a search engine Va website. That's probably I would type in burial, possibly. And something come up.

[Moderator] : Okay, good and thoughts on let's say you were looking to to do some sort of planning. What might you want to, or what? What questions might you want answered? If you were going to be looking into this.

[P15] : Location of the site call calls of documentation needed.  : What what you need to do to start planning the planning process.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P15] : That's some of my questions I might have thought of.

[Moderator] : Okay, yeah, that's good. And then any thoughts on if this is something that could be useful or why anyone might want to do this.

[P15] : Well, I think anybody who was nearing their end of life would think about these things.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?  : And and any thoughts on on specifically, so yeah, so timeline nearing end of life, any other thoughts on why, why they may want to do that.

[P15] : Oh, also  : To ease the minds of relatives and family members in case such an event happens. So you wouldn't be startled when you know something happens, and  : I mean also, life is so unexpected as well. I mean, you may not even be at the end of life, and you know life is just uncertain at times, so you never so.

[Moderator] : Yeah, you're right. You're doing. You never know.

[P15] : The way that you might want to plan things because of uncertainty.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it.  : So with this application, I'm going to show you a little bit more in a little bit after you do apply there. Once a decision has been made, there's 2 possible results. One. Yes, the person is eligible to be buried in the Va National Cemetery. Other option. No, they're not eligible. And then a reason will be listed and potential next steps if they wanted to  : look into more of that. So thoughts. So let's we're going to pretend that you've applied. You've got this this decision, this this letter that says yes, this person is eligible to be buried in a national cemetery.  : thoughts on how you might want, or how how you might want to be informed of the decision. Once it is ready.

[P15] : Typically, I don't like to have mail sent to my home. Everything is electronically nowadays. I don't know. A lot of elderly still seem to be what they call it, technologically informed or  : inclined to use technology. But.

[Moderator] : Yeah, yeah.

[P15] : Embracing technology. And I love technology text messages. Or I don't necessarily need to have a a phone call avoid phone calls at most times for one contacting. As I said, electronic note, notification emails.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P15] : Text messages log into my website the Va website and getting a inbox possibly, is the way notify anything practically for me.

[Moderator] : Anything. Okay?  : Yeah. Got it. And then thoughts on making sure that family members would have access to that information. Since you said you. You would like to see it all all digitally.

[P15] : Oh, well, I would have to share it. That by, Doc, what I logged in, and I see a documentation I have, and I would download to to my computer and then be able to print it out and share it fashion, unless I can add additional family members contact to the Va and.

[Moderator] : Hmm.

[P15] : Let's say, of course it excuse me  : if it's my spouse, I'd add to her into the contact list that they'll get the email as well.

[Moderator] : Oh, okay, so like, so, so like, when the decision letter comes, that would all that would go to both you and your spouse. Is that what you mean?

[P15] : If it's authorized right, I mean, allow me to add, authorize, and  : people to my profile in the Va.

[Moderator] : Oh, got it? Okay, got it? So that leads me to my next question. Would there be anything else that you would want from the Va. In terms of help to make sure that your loved ones had access to that letter. That information.

[P15] : No, as far as getting the letter to my loved one. I don't think the  : I'm not sure exactly what you're asking again.

[Moderator] : So so you would. You had mentioned, like 1 1 example that you would want from the Va. Would be adding another authorized user so that they would also like say, Get the email, for example.

[P15] : Correct.

[Moderator] : With this letter. I'm just wondering if there would be other ways from the Va. That you would want in order to help facilitate that.

[P15] : Well, I mean, I've embrace technology and for notification electronically. But they they can surely reach out to my loved one via phone call. I mean, that's fine as well. But  : the phone up outbound phone call to them.

[Moderator] : Okay, good.  : All right. And tell me about, have you just super broad question filling out forms through the Va. I know you said you had done claims for for disability along those lines? Have those like claims like that? Has that been online on paper? A mix? What's been your experience.

[P15] : Yeah, I think that seems to be much easier now with the Va and everything is possible electronically. So you can form and it's in adobe format and some of the forms you could  : actually type it in.  : print it out and then upload the form to. I think there's a page that you can upload all documentation so like, why mail something, and then you have to pay for postage and  : go through all that. Everything would be much easier. We could be. Yeah, I'm sorry. That's basically what you're asking me. Right?

[Moderator] : Yeah, yeah, no. That's right. So so it sounds like the forms. So you've done them through adobe, reader, filled them out and then re uploaded like the Pdf. Just wanna make sure I'm understanding what you've.

[P15] : And the reason is where, like, okay, you have to print them out, and it requires a signature, and that's you need to print them out. But if it doesn't require a signature, I guess typically it is. Authorization. Form requires your handwritten signature. You wouldn't have to print out the form and re upload it. It's like the process.

[Moderator] : okay, got it. So for for the forms that you have filled out, has that been have, have you have you done it, both from your phone, from your computer, has been one or the other.

[P15] : Oh, no, as far as uploading forms. No, I I let's see.  : Well, I printed it out from from the computer, from from my computer.  : And and I there's no option on on the web, on the on the app base to to.

[Moderator] : To print out forms. No.  : Got it? Nothing on the app.  : Okay. How about any? Or have there been any forms? It could be different from like another website. Besides the Va. Have there been any forms that you have done from your phone? Really at all? If there's anything you're filling out.

[P15] : Fill out a form on the phone that will.  : I think I've tried to download form and save. It has a to file. Possibly.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P15] : A picture of it, and then on on my apple device, you could  : use your fingers and modify it by making the signature, save that save that photo again and.  : Able to send an email out.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P15] : So I've done that. I think I don't know if it was acceptable, and I don't recall, but I attempted to do something like that.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. And do you recall  : if that was any easier or harder, as opposed to doing that same thing from your computer.

[P15] : Yes, difficulty wise and using a phone to sign. It's kinda like, no, it's because your handwriting is using a finger to sign something. It's not. It's very sloppy. And the phone very small super compared to printing it out and signing it. It's more official.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it more efficient to print up. Okay? And then how about after you? So going back to any sort of Va forms after you filled them out. I know, like, for example, any claims you've done, what has been your experience after you filled out the form in terms of what, what next steps are there in regards to communication from the Va. As to what the next steps might be?

[P15] : In my experience with the Va. When I send forms into the Va. It's just it just sits there and says, Well, we received it. There's no updates on it, and it could be months on. And and oh, it's still pending some other activity. It's somewhat vague. So that's the thing that I've been experiencing on my last interaction with them regarding  : some question about dependency, adding, for educational benefits, such and such. But anyway, it's it's it's I still haven't got  : a clear answer, they say, was received, but it may be in processing.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay.

[P15] : That's your question. But.

[Moderator] : Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah. So that so have  : are, are you? Are you able to get actual status updates?

[P15] : I'm still a little vague about it. It says  : that they told me they received it, and we're still processing it for.  : but it's been several months, so  : And it says you could be waiting for a while, but then I saw. So I know I submitted all the documents, and that I needed  : so.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?

[P15] : And I don't know if making a phone call makes anything different. But but anyway.

[Moderator] : Yeah, is that since you mentioned phone call, is that is that something you do in order to check up on the status.

[P15] : In my expense. When I make a phone call, you could be a drag on process that could last for hours on to to reach the right person.

[Moderator] : Hmm.

[P15] : And and you might not even get the proper answer. It's a vague answer, or I redirect you to someplace else. Yeah. So.

[Moderator] : Okay. Good.

[P15] : I don't know why. Why would I make a phone call? It could be, you know, I could be on hold for a long duration just.

[Moderator] : Hmm.

[P15] : Wait. That's why I don't like to do that. But.

[Moderator] : Okay, yeah, got it. So sounds like this has not been the greatest experience in your ideal world. What would you want in regards to communication and status updates. After you have filled out forms.

[P15] : Well, I liked my correspondence to reach the appropriate department and provide  : not a vague answer. But you know  : it seems sometimes robotic. The response I get. It's just. And I seen this quite often that you know my my question is not fully addressed.  : Not even a somebody. A live person, might have answered the question.

[Moderator] : Okay, so you want more, more clarity. It sounds like with when as to what what is happening.

[P15] : Right. I mean, when I get a response back. When I asked a question it it didn't seem like it seemed. It definitely appeared like? The answer was a copy and paste type of answer rather than an actual person responding back with with the type.

[Moderator] : Oh, okay, got it. And is that when you say you're asking questions, is that through the the ask Va, or is that something else?

[P15] : It's it's basically when I log into the Va, there's a almost like  : inbox outbox type of thing of anything I ask the Va, they'll have. Yeah, it's it's like a pseudo mail. And email type of thing.

[Moderator] : Got it. Got it?  : It sounds like you. You're generally not given any sort of timeline with the updates you do get, am I? Did I get that right.

[P15] : One pressing issue that I'm trying to get an answer on right now. I still have not fully understand what the status is and what's holding up something so  : just one outstanding issue right now.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?  : Okay? So we're gonna switch gears, a little bit and do some screen, sharing, do you know how to share your screen through your Zoom app.

[P15] : Yes, on the bottom there's a there's an option that says share, or something like that, right?

[Moderator] : Yep, yep, so let me have you go ahead and do that, and once you've shared I will send you a link.  : Let me know if you need any assistance getting through it.

[P15] : I think it's going. I'm not sure.

[Moderator] : Oh, there you go, perfect, perfect. Okay, let me just send a link. Give me a moment. This is gonna come up in the zoom chat right there. So there we go, the Emily to meeting group, chat at the bottom, go ahead and tap on that link.  : And so, oh, there we go. Okay? So this is the burial. So we are in the, as you probably saw, we are in the actual website. I'm not going to have you sign in or fill anything out, so no personal information is going to be entered in here. So this is, as you can see, the Va burial benefits page on the website. So we're going to pretend that you are looking for information on preparing for your own burial.  : Have a skim through this page. I know there's a lot, so I don't want you to read everything but thoughts on what information you might might be looking for as you're preparing for your own burial. What questions you might want to have answered.

[P15] : yeah, I mean the website. It's it's got the bullet points. I would click eligibility and take a look. What is it you asked me again.

[Moderator] : Oh, it's yeah. I mean, you're starting to answer. It's just trying to get a general sense of what information you would be looking for on.  : Oh.

[P15] : Yeah, the first.st  : The 1st thing, obviously, would be the eligibility. But I don't. I'm not eligible. There's nothing else to go from. There.

[Moderator] : Okay, so step one would be eligibility. Got it? What other? What other questions might you want? Answered as you're looking into this.

[P15] : Cost. Is that?  : Yeah, I mean eligibility. And you know, even if you're eligible, is it? Is it completely cost free.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P15] : Think I kind of covered this location.  : And coordination, I imagine.

[Moderator] : Okay, so what like, it's just, it's how how the coordination happens.

[P15] : Yeah, like processes, steps to get it going.

[Moderator] : Okay. Got it.  : And thoughts on how clear you think this. This information is presented here.

[P15] : It's I haven't clicked through it. I I don't know but but if I did.  : I'm sure it gave me it would give me a lot of information. I didn't know that this was there on on the website. I didn't try yet.  : Alright, what was your question again, that you had want me to respond.

[Moderator] : You have already answered that. So yeah, I'm just trying to get a sense of just what sort of the the clarity of how things are presented.

[P15] : Well, it says, you know, tells you different bullet points that you could click on, and everything, I think, even schedule burial for veterans.  : So it seems like it's quite detailed. But yeah, I mean, there's a lot of bullet points to look at.

[Moderator] : Okay, yeah, yeah, I'm not. Gonna have you read through everything as as you say it is, it is quite a lot.  : So when you are. I know you said you have looked at the site before, when you are in a mode of just of researching, of wanting, wanting to find information thoughts on. If you might use your cell phone as opposed to computer, and why you might choose one or the other.

[P15] : For read readability or ease of navigation, I would say, the laptop or or  : computer, because I can use a mouse and click. And  : whereas on this, based on convenience, that I'm not near my laptop and I could read through it. I'm traveling.

[Moderator] : Hmm.

[P15] : I think the issue regarding a smartphone and the laptop. Apparently it's the size of the screen, and.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay.

[P15] : But navigational wise is similar.

[Moderator] : Okay. So so primarily, because of size, you would want to be on a laptop.

[P15] : And if I wanted to start a process that required me to fill out paperwork, I would need to be on the laptop when I need to save some  : Doc. Pdf. Files to print out, and such.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. Have you filled out? So I know you've talked about the forms that you filled out where you are downloading a Pdf, and filling it out there. Have you filled out any forms that are all directly within a website? So you're not actually downloading a Pdf.

[P15] : Have I done that? I think I did?

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P15] : Typically the only reason you would need to print out a form and and is because you need to. And it requires a signature.  : That's  : every time I remember having to do that, if it's if it's a form that doesn't, and even some  : I've seen.  : I have signed docusign forms that require me to print it out. I could sign it virtually.  : and save and and upload.

[Moderator] : Okay, yeah.

[P15] : That's something I've seen. Now this came to mind because I've done this before.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P15] : Unfortunately, I don't see that on the Va. Side, though.

[Moderator] : Oh, got it? Okay? So if there were forms, where, just like you said, either you could use docusign or a signature is not required. Would there be any instances that you might want to do that on the phone, as opposed to doing those forms on the computer.

[P15] : Yes, because everybody has their phone with them all the time. Practically every everyone has a smartphone it's convenience obviously being so.  : and you know you may not be able to get to your computer until late in the evening, or, you know, travel. You want something done right away. It'll be on your phone.

[Moderator] : Okay, so more, more speed. And if if you just don't have access to your laptop or your your computer.

[P15] : Yes.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it.  : Got it all right. So let me have you. We're going to pretend that you are interested in applying for this this pre-need burial have a just a quick skim of the introduction of so how many you scroll up toward the top?  : Yeah, right there. So, reading through the very brief introduction of the pre-need burial. Let me know what you think about how clearly it is saying things.

[P15] : Well, if you don't understand certain terminology. But typically it seems like  : and it's it's pretty good, well laid out. It has eligibility, pre-need bird agilability.  : It seemed like everything isn't in the right order.  : so you would have to click through each one and see what information you're looking for.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. Let me have you go ahead and tap on the pre-need burial. Eligibility, determination.  : Okay, wait for that to load up. So again, we're gonna we're going to pretend that you are going to at least explore applying for this.  : Have a look through and let me know your thoughts on  : preparing to apply what you might need. How easy or difficult it appears to you.

[P15] : Yeah, I'm I'm I have to read through it and figure out what I need right?

[Moderator] : Yeah, so kind of a like, if you like, step step one there. You know.  : thoughts on on how clear the information is. There.

[P15] : I'm actually reading it. So it says, eligibility eligible. You can't be dishonorable discharged you had  : something about the spouse and child service member.  : Well, I'm not sure what this means.  : The spouse or dependent child service member, even if the service member has already passed.  : Well, this I'm I'm a little bit a little, a little bit lost on that second bullet point.

[Moderator] : Okay, what? Yeah, yeah. We can. You share, like, what? What is confusing about that.

[P15] : It says the veteran, can't be dishonorably discharged when separated, or the spouse or dependent of can't. Can't  : the the spouse or child can't be dishonorable, discharge as well or.

[Moderator] : Okay. So it sounds like this. This is just not clear to you like.

[P15] : What does that mean? A spouse or dependent of service member  : it was, I mean, what? What clause is it talking about? I'm not sure.

[Moderator] : Got it.

[P15] : Aces the adults, child, and  : do they refer? I'm not sure, if this refers that each of these members, whether it be the veteran, the spouse. Independent child.  : None of these people can be dishonorable. This charge, it seemed like, that's what it's referring to. But the 1st bullet point was clear, but the second and 3rd one wasn't really clear about what was referring to.  : based on my one. My reading.

[Moderator] : Okay. So it's not clear like who it? Who it is actually talking about. Is that what you mean?

[P15] : Oh, the 1st one! It definitely was clear. It says the veteran can't be dishearted with this chart, but then it says, the spouse or dependent child.  : Do they mean like those people can't be dishonored in Detroit? What are they referring to regarding a spouse or dependent child?

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay, okay, yeah. So just making sure, that's  : looks like that. That's not clear. Okay.

[P15] : I'm not sure what it's referring to. What? What excluded it didn't say what what they can't have done, or I'm not sure exactly what it meant.

[Moderator] : Oh, oh! So like! If the the dishonorable discharge applies to the spouse or the dependent child.

[P15] : Yeah, because it didn't say it didn't say what clause is trying to apply it to.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay, got it?  : Yeah. Yeah. So what what it is saying is is like overall. The the veteran  : cannot have received a dishonorable discharge  : separate from that. If there's a spouse it would have to be the spouse of a veteran who didn't receive a dishonorable discharge. But but it sounds like that's just not written clearly.

[P15] : Yeah, I'm I'm still lost on that.

[Moderator] : Yeah, that's right. I mean, we we want to find out what's not not clear. So that's good information. Thank you.  : And then have a yeah, any any other thoughts on? Well, yeah. Well, you know, with that step one  : we'll assume that you that you assume you, you will be eligible thoughts on on gathering what you might need in order to do the application here.

[P15] : Oh, it didn't.  : Well, let's just get more details about eligibility. If I wanted to. Then same thing about forms, then you could find cemeteries, where it can be buried at.

[Moderator] : Hmm.

[P15] : What what's interesting is, I know that it's a very simple  : eligible. It's a very simple eligibility to to  : meet, because most veterans are honorable discharge most so, if that was the case, practically anybody can be eligible. If that was the simplest requirement.  : Yeah, I'm surprised that that was that was the case.

[Moderator] : Oh, okay, got it.  : Would there be? A sense that that is coming to a surprise to you? Is there  : any other information you would want regarding regarding the discharge.

[P15] : I'm sorry. Well, is there another other information that I want to.

[Moderator] : Yeah, well, no. Or I'm just. I'm I'm responding to your to your note that  : it looks like most people would be eligible here, so is was, is there any other information you would want?  : Since you just said like about most people, would probably be eligible for this.

[P15] : Right? That's correct. And it's surprising if that was the case in a very  : everybody's applying, and there would be like tons of application. But I'm gonna guess, is people that are low income, but wanted to apply for this because I'm going to guess most most people will want to be buried near their  : significant other or family member that already located a certain.  : If you're going to be buried in the National Cemetery, you're going to be buried among other service members, but not next to your loved ones.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?

[P15] : That just came to my mind, and.

[Moderator] : Yeah, alright. So you want.

[P15] : It's it's based.  : excluding the free factor of of the whole thing. It may not want to be in there, some in another place.

[Moderator] : Okay, so location would be important.  : Okay, let me, I'm going to have you scroll down a little bit i'm gonna skip over this part, and then under number or below number 4, where it says, what information do I need to apply? Let me have you read through those, and let me know how easy or difficult you think it would it would be to have the to have these ready for the application.

[P15] : Yeah. Well, everybody knows. Social security number is pretty simple date of birth. That's on my passport.  : data service.  : you know. I keep losing my Dd 214 s. And you know there's a website in a national Archive, and I would download it again and save it. And so I can always get my Dd 214. And it's it's each one I could always request. It's crazy that I've done this many times.

[Moderator] : Okay, so do you, do you currently have a digital version of your Dd, 2, 14.

[P15] : Yes, yes, and like I said, I don't have it again. I could make another request for the next.

[Moderator] : Yeah.

[P15] : And it'll be a new new request, and within 24 HI have a  : another request number, and I just copy and paste, and I can open that file again.

[Moderator] : Got it. Got it. Okay, I'm gonna have you pause right there, and I'm gonna send you another link through the zoom chat.  : So let's see. So if yeah, if you can switch back to your zoom app.

[P15] : So I have to stop screen broadcasting. Yes.

[Moderator] : No. Keep the keep the screen broadcast on but if you could.  : yeah. So switch to the the left. Yeah, there we go. Yeah. So the the figma  : link there. Yep, this is so. Now now we're going to be in a prototype. So a lot of the buttons will not be working.

[P15] : I'm familiar. Sorry I've done some of this research study for other companies.

[Moderator] : Oh, yeah. Okay. Good.

[P15] : So I know this thing, but it's a of

[Moderator] : It's a very, it's a very, very common tool. So this is. We're just gonna look at just a couple screens of the pre-kneed eligibility application.  : I just want to get your thoughts on one part of it. So again, we're going to pretend that you have decided to apply  : on the phone. Here, let me have you tap on the bottom next to the Green Arrow, the start, the pre-need eligibility. So we're pretending you have jumped ahead to step 6. And this is the supporting file. So we just talked about you would need your Dd 214 thoughts on if you were doing this on your phone, thoughts on how easy or difficult it would be in order to upload that Dd, 214 from your phone.

[P15] : Well, I just you know what I was going to put in something interesting. I believe I try to upload Dt. 2, 14 when you get it from the National Archive website. It's  : password encrypted.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P15] : And you'll get this file and you try to send it. They couldn't even open it.

[Moderator] : Oh, interesting. Okay.

[P15] : I've seen this, and what I don't remember was it a Dt. 214?  : But anyway.  : what I had to do was, I had to either screenshot it when I opened the file, and save as a  : I believe, was a Jpeg file in order to upload something.

[Moderator] : Sure.

[P15] : But again, most are password protected, and share that password, or they don't have it. You can't even share that password, and when you upload file so that that becomes a burden.

[Moderator] : Okay, so it sounds like that. That password protection would make it difficult to do this here.

[P15] : Yeah, in in the dg, 2, 14. It has that code. They have to copy and paste in order to open that file because it related to you only.

[Moderator] : no, it's no password protected. So  : yeah, got it okay, got it, yeah, that's that's good to know, so that obviously would make this difficult, do you see? And let's pretend that you had solved that aspect. But do you see any benefits for filling out this application on your phone as opposed to your computer.

[P15] : It might be possible to open that file and do a screen capture on your phone.  : Yeah file. I don't think it will work. I haven't tried it, but then you can upload.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P15] : Oh, now, when you upload it from your phone, it looks for a file rather than a  : a photo picture, I believe, and.

[Moderator] : Hmm.

[P15] : If it doesn't find. Okay, I want to upload file, but it's looking for a file rather than a photo. If I screenshot it.  : it goes to the gallery, and if I can't navigate to the gallery to upload it, and it wouldn't work.

[Moderator] : Oh, okay, got it? Oh, yes, all right. So it sounds like there'll be a few, a few challenges there. Certainly.

[P15] : Yeah.

[Moderator] : I would.  : Yeah, so we'll we'll we'll start good.

[P15] : Do it on on the computer, about.

[Moderator] : Yeah, so we'll we'll we'll pretend that you were able to solve all the problems that you just mentioned. Regarding upload, do you see? Or would there be any any benefits that you can think of? In order to doing the application on your phone?

[P15] : Oh, most obvious as convenience and and portability of your phone is definitely  : I definitely would like to do on my phone. You know, I'm always on my phone.

[Moderator] : Got it, got it? And then, so specifically,  : about this, this pre- need is is this something that you might. We're going to pretend to ignore the whole upload issue. But since you said you'd like to fill out forms for convenience, would the pre-need application? Would that be something that you would want to do like on the go when you're not near the computer, or to wait until you are back at your computer.

[P15] : Based on what I'm doing. I I could do it on on my phone. If I'm traveling the bus ride or I'm on a train. I'm flying.  : I could play around with it. I'm at Airport waiting for something to go somewhere. Yeah.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P15] : At the office, or, you know, at home. I I do it at home.

[Moderator] : Got it. Okay, great. Let me have you tap on the submit button on the lower right. We're pretending that you are submitted, and we are pretending that you have just filled out the application. And so this is the screen you've gotten to. We're going to pause on this screen now. But thoughts on. What would you expect the next steps to be, or what would you expect next to happen after you have just completed the application.

[P15] : No typically Va. Like to send the paperwork in the mail.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P15] : Probably gonna happen no phone calls. But  : And I don't think they'd like to send any  : secure messaging which I prefer. But.

[Moderator] : Oh, okay, so you, the secure messaging you, you prefer.

[P15] : Yeah, I said, I prefer, like the virtual email type of thing, any type of electronic notification.  : I don't particularly like to have mail sent to me. It's just another paper. It get lost and waste of paperwork as well. It's just  : that's plus. Yeah.  : I just. I just don't like the paper trail necessarily.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. So I'm assuming I know the answer to this. But just to confirm it sounds like you would not print this page. Here, then, is that is that correct?

[P15] : If I did, I could print the page, save it as a Pdf.

[Moderator] : Oh, okay, yeah, okay, so you would save it. You got it. Okay? And then.  : okay, so you would get some sort of digital confirmation. Any. How about any thoughts about knowing the status of the application.

[P15] : I don't know if there's a way to check, but I'm guessing there might be a link. I don't get it. Then let's ask va, hey! What's the status of this  : eligibility? Determination, you know, and.

[Moderator] : You check it with them.

[P15] : Like to route it to the right person, either.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? Thoughts on. Let's pretend that you know you you have. You have applied. How important is it to you to to know the status of the application.

[P15] : Well, I'm just gonna guess if they didn't contact you and you didn't get any answers, they don't know yet, but seems like what that that the Va. Is. They don't have it. They don't tell you. Then they they haven't decided yet.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay.

[P15] : Obviously we didn't tell you because you we don't know what the answer is  : after. Actually, you know what's gonna happen? Well.  : if they know the answer, they will contact you.

[Moderator] : Got it. Okay in in a more. We're gonna step out of reality. So in a more in your ideal world, what sort of communication, or or how how important would it be to know the status of the application.

[P15] : Well, it'd be more important if I'm nearing that time, you know. But nearing that time.  : Not really that pressing, but you know I sure hope to know in. Let's say 3 months. I don't know.

[Moderator] : Pretty much.

[P15] : Duration. It might be.

[Moderator] : Yeah. Okay, so since you mentioned the 3 months would knowing the the timeline would that be important to you?

[P15] : Again. This would be more important if I was nearing that timeframe of you know, quite. But if it wasn't  : but then again like I said, life is uncertain. You don't know when something's gonna happen. So.

[Moderator] : Sure. Sure. Yep.  : so we'll we're we're going to jump ahead in the in the pretend, timeline that the decision has been made.  : How would you? I know you said that, like they often send letters.  : Any any further thoughts on how you would expect to be notified that the decision has been made.

[P15] : I know they don't make phone calls. So it's gonna put paper trail.  : And and they don't do any electronic notification that I'm aware of.

[Moderator] : Okay, is that something you you would want.

[P15] : Yes, I would definitely like to get some type of, and I I try to contact the Va help department using secure messaging. And so there, there's many ways to to do it electronically. And  : that's what my preferred method. I think.

[Moderator] : Okay, so to do it electronically, okay, good and then any further, I'm just gonna revisit a conversation we had earlier where  : in regards to having your family members have access to the final decision.  : and I think you said you would. You would want some like them to be able to  : to log in or yeah, if you could review just what what you would want in order for your family to have access to the decision letter.

[P15] : Well, if it's  : what happens, if you know they need to be notified in case oh, something happened to me unexpectedly. They didn't get no, they don't know now they're in a limbo about what I want, you know. If I didn't disclose my wishes.

[Moderator] : That could be a problem. So.

[P15] : I don't know if they have access to the Va. Website, but.  : For them to be notified in some manner.  : Yeah, I can't add additional family members log into the Va. That I'm aware of.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? How about in in terms of sharing any documents? Is that something you you have done? Or or you think would do.

[P15] : I ha like, I said, the only way I have to share this documents with us to download and and print it out or email it to somebody else, but not for fax it to my Va website. They don't. They don't have that.

[Moderator] : The okay? Yeah. Okay, let me have you scroll to the bottom of this page and click on the continue  : and then tap on the pink. Go to my Va.  : We're going to go to a a pretend account here by a person named Sammy Smith.  : so I know you've mentioned this this account a few times, going back to the pretend timeline of you have already applied  : thoughts on. If this section might, or this page rather might be some someplace where you would want to look for the status updates of the application.

[P15] : Yeah, you know what? There's a summary when you log in. It has all these different categories where the claims the pure healthcare, it'd be perfect to when you log in. It shows you all the things you're doing. It seems very familiar with me, but then it should be listed here as, oh, the status of your  : you know, bearer requests. And yeah, this is very familiar.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. And then how about for that? The the final decision letter. Would this be a place you would want to find something like that.

[P15] : Yeah, I believe you can download the final decision letter possibly from from  : if you click on right here is the benefit application forms continue.

[Moderator] : Okay.  : so from here. And I know you, you had mentioned, potentially like downloading, the form and and emailing to family members. Is, is that something you think you would you would do with the emailing to family members.

[P15] : Yes, I would.

[Moderator] : Do it. Okay, got it.  : Okay?  : And let me have you scroll down to the bottom of this page again and click on the yellow go to Va. App.  : so we've got the pretend app here. Excuse me, pretend app here, so same questions of after you have applied, and you are still waiting on an answer. Would this would would anywhere within this app, be someplace where you would want to look for status updates.

[P15] : Yeah. Well, normally claims, I see, is my disability claim. But maybe that's where I should be seeing the you know burial. But this should be separate, though it should be another tab. Instead of that.

[Moderator] : Okay? So not within the claims.  : because claims refer to my compensation claim. And  : oh, got it. Okay, you don't want that separate.  : Okay, and  : talk to me about how important that might be, especially since you said you're you know you're on the app often to have access to that status of the application on your app.

[P15] : It's great to have it on. The app is like I said there should be another box for it. Yeah.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? And then how about the that final decision letter? I know you've said you would like it within your Va account on the website. How about here on the app.

[P15] : That'd be great to be able to access that the decision letter. And then I believe you could click on it, and and then you could have a outgoing box where you send it via email to yourself. So that's something I've seen that done as well.

[Moderator] : Okay, so you would you? You would want to access it so you can. You can send it off to the appropriate places.

[P15] : Basically, you'll be able to see a decision later. But then you can email it to yourself and look at it later. You know.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P15] : For reference.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? Any any other reasons that you might want to? Have have that this, that decision letter here accessible on your app.

[P15] : Well for the for the purpose of quick, quickly getting an answer. Yeah, on the app. But if you're asking for answer, you could always log in on your computer and take a look.  : depend on timing and criticalness of getting the answer.

[Moderator] : Okay. Yep. Got it.  : And any thoughts on where, exactly in the app you would expect or want to find this decision letter for the pre-need.

[P15] : Oh, maybe in messages.

[Moderator] : And messages. Okay.

[P15] : Well, no, I what I seen for messages. I I might think I've done this before. It's only it goes to this health hospital messaging platform, and it just lets you met message different  : departments for for the hospital. That's for the Va. Hospital. That's why I seen before, but I don't think it does it from there.

[Moderator] : Okay. So messages from from the hospital. Okay.  : And any any other place within here that you, you would want to see that that pre-need decision letter.

[P15] : A decision letter. There's no place for it on the profile. Let me. I don't know if it does it. But no, I don't. It's very. This website is, I mean this app based thing. It's very limited.  : Unless unless they have a different add on, it's different sections, though, letters and decisions over here. I don't see it here that I'm aware of.

[Moderator] : Okay. If if there was like you said an additional tab, an additional section. Would that be useful to you to have it accessible on the app?

[P15] : Yes, it would be.  : I don't recall like I said, the claims portion. I think it just goes to disability. I don't recall if it doesn't, as that.

[Moderator] : Okay, good. And any further thoughts on how how it could be? It could be useful to have that decision later on. The app.

[P15] : Just to be notified quicker and other than that no.

[Moderator] : Oh, okay, so have a habit, after you've already been notified of of the system, so that you just you. You have the letter.

[P15] : Oh, so I can forward it to my family members right from my phone via text or something. It'd be a quick, quicker way to, you know.  : Get it out, I guess, to other people, fat or other people.

[Moderator] : Okay, easier to share.  : Okay, those are all my questions. I'm just going to check in with my team here, Natasha and Parker. I know Thomas had to go, but if either of you have any questions, feel free to unmute and ask them now.  : Okay, now, anything else, Larry, you'd like to share about burial benefits that we have not already discussed.

[P15] : No, you asked me the question. I respond to them, I don't, you know. Look into now, but I wasn't aware, so I'll.

[Moderator] : Okay. Great.

[P15] : Are able to get the progress with this. You know these things that you guys improving on.

[Moderator] : Okay, great and I just want to confirm once more now that we've had the whole conversation. Are you still comfortable with us? Potentially using clips from this with our Va partners.

[P15] : Yeah, I believe you said you're making an anonymous.

[Moderator] : Yes, yeah, everything will be anonymous. Exactly.

[P15] : Personalize, and it won't be a  : associate to me, anyway. So it's fine.

[Moderator] : Yeah. Okay, great, thank you. Well, thank you so much for your time. This is always super helpful to talk directly with veterans about this. And yeah, it was nice to hear your experience and your thoughts, and just looking through things to see how you like to use everything within the va, so  : I know Paragean's gonna reach out for a thank you. Note. And I hope you have a great rest of your day today.

[P15] : You'll let the Perk and know I complete this study with you guys, and they'll they'll know what to do.

[Moderator] : Yes, great will do.

[P15] : Becky. Right, thank you for your time.

[Moderator] : Alright. Thank you. Take care!
