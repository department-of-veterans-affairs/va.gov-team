# P7

Moderator: To confirm. Are you okay? Are you comfortable with me? Recording while we talk today?

P7: Yes.

Moderator: Okay, great. And also, would you be okay if I potentially use clips from today's session to share with the VA partners?

P7: Of course. Yes.

Moderator: Thank you so much. Okay, so to start. If you could tell me just a bit about yourself as a veteran, what branch did you serve? And when did you retire or separate.

P7: Let's see, Navy. Jeez, I'm old. I just turned 62 roughly.

Moderator: Say, okay, yeah, it's fine.

P7: Yeah. 62. I separated in 89. And full full retirement 100% permanent and total.

Moderator: Okay, got it, got it.

P7: Disability blah blah blah.

Moderator: Okay, and can you tell me how you have been involved with the VA over the years since you.

P7: Intimately.

Moderator: All right. What what does that mean?

P7: [REDACTED: details on their medical needs]

They consider they consider me housebound so. It's kind of one of those things where you do start thinking about, you know, stuff. And I've I've done some pre needs pre need, I guess. I paid. I paid some people to take care of my carcass when they haul it off.

Moderator: Okay, got it.

P7: That's in a nutshell.

Moderator: Okay.

P7: What else you want to know?

Moderator: So more along. How much you've been involved with the VA. How much, if any, do you use the website and or app.

P7: I check appointments. Excuse me. I check appointments. Sometimes use the pharmacy app just to see where where stuff has been shipped or not. My experience with the VA website has been from the absolute beginning. It's been a lovely journey, as they say. And I really appreciate you guys and what you have done, because I see your hand in a lot of things. It's and it it makes sense what you do. 

The way you do this process is it's incredibly valid. And anytime you ever have any problems with funding or anything like that I've got. I've got some straight line [REDACTED].

Moderator: Noted, all right.

P7: Honestly, seriously, if if you have any trouble with that in the future just please feel free to let me know is like I said, I've got. I don't have much pool, but I've got more pull than your average bear.

Moderator: Got it. Okay? Great. Alright. So you mentioned you use the app, do you? Or I guess, how. How often are you using the app specifically as opposed to the VA website?

P7: I'm kind of a creature of habit. So I pretty much go to the website because I don't. App apps are still sort of not credible to me yet. If that makes sense. I'll I'll pick up the app when the when the website kicks me over to the app. Does that make sense?

Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

P7: Sometimes I think I'm using the app without intending to use the app.

Moderator: Hmm, okay.

P7: If that makes any sense at all.

Moderator: It totally, and when you say you don't find it credible. Can you say more about that?

P7: Oh, I find that apps, it seems like they're segmented from the web, if that makes sense. It seems like it's a standalone thing that is not connected to the mothership, if you will. It's like, I use the Amazon app because that's just what I do. Because Jeff Bezos has just made it very easy to use. And the VA app is there, but I'm so welded to the past, and—and I'm so in love with the VA website because, again, I've seen it from the beginning. So it almost feels like I'm kissing somebody else when I go to the app.I feel like I'm running around on the VA website.

Moderator: Okay, got it, got it. So do do you know offhand, you said that sometimes the site will kick you to the app? Can you recall like for what purposes it might kick you to the app?

P7: I'm not certain. It just seems like suddenly I'm on the app instead of the web. I'm not. I'm not sure whether I just think that's happening or whether it actually is happening.

Moderator: Okay, got it. And so when you're on the VA website, is that more on your phone, more on a laptop or desktop computer?

P7: Yeah, phone and desktop and ipad.

Moderator: Okay. So all 3. What do you have a preference of which one to use? Or when when would you choose? One or the other.

P7: Which website or which?

Moderator: So when on the VA website? How would you decide if you're gonna go on that on your computer versus your tablet versus your phone?

P7: Phone. I just key it in all of my just key it in. VA and then it populates in my through my favorites, I guess, or through traffic.

Moderator: Yeah, go ahead.

P7: That may be how I'm getting the app.

Moderator: Mm-hmm

P7: Possibly I I don't know the mechanics. I guess it's Jeff, Paul.. Who else is on the call? The nuts and bolts guy.

Moderator: The nuts and bolts, guy. I'm not.

P7: He was. He was the last person that I met.

Moderator: Oh, this is the folks on here are are Jonathan, Natalie, and Natasha.

P7: Yeah, Jonathan, he's he's the nuts and bolts guy.

Moderator: There are a few of us working on this.

P7: Yeah, he's the only one I saw.  But yeah, I I don't exactly know the mechanics of how I end up on the app versus the website, but sometimes I end up on one or the other, and I don't. I'm not sure it's of no concern to me.

Moderator: That's fine when you when you decide. So before you touch any digital device, when you decide, you need to go to the VA website. How are you deciding? If you're going to pick up your phone or your tablet or go to your desktop computer.

P7: It. It just depends on proximity. I I don't use my desktop or my laptop per se that much, unless I'm ensconced at my desk which I try to avoid, and then the ipad I use when I'm traveling and my phone, you know, if if I'm driving, I'm usually playing words with friends while I'm driving. So, which should be horrifying, but but I can. I can handle it.

Moderator: Oh, alright!

P7: Anytime I want.

Moderator: Got it. So you said you don't normally prefer to be at your desk, to be on your laptop. Any any reason for that specific one to to going to websites or to the VA website rather?

P7: As as far as the desktop and stuff. I've got a lot of stuff on my desk that I'm literally trying to avoid. So I just it, it's not the computer. It's it's all the paperwork.

Moderator: Got it, okay. So jumping to the next thing in terms of the benefits you have always been entitled to at a veteran. Do you recall how you have learned about what is available to you?

P7: From the pamphlets back in the day. They had a handbook that was probably I don't know. 3 quarters of an inch thick. It was about a three. No, it's it was about a six by four inch handbook that was dense and written on really flimsy paper that I just it was almost like an onion skin paper. I think they wanted it to stick together. But that was kind of where it started out, and then there. Then those turned into some like slick publication kind of stuff. And then let's see, there was like some telephone benefits coordination thing that that you had to call long distance to use, and that was horribly expensive. And then the web stuff.

Moderator: Okay.

P7: But it was, it was all poorly constructed. It was it? The VA. Is just always kind of been a train wreck as far as metrics, and how they do stuff with the.

Moderator: Ok. How about anything now? In terms of benefits? What do you find? What resources do you find have been the most helpful for you when you want to understand what else you are entitled to?

P7: I I help other people with their benefits, and I usually go to the web. I hate saying the web that sounds so archaic.  It's, it's just hard. It's like Internet and website, those words seem like they should have been replaced. But yeah, I'll I'll generally do a Google search or something. If if I'm not wanting to wade through the search features on on the VA website, have always been a little bit convoluted. So it's a little bit easier to go outside and fire in than it is to go to the website and search from there. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. Alright. So you're you're doing much more broad search for.

P7: Yeah.

Moderator: Okay. And then, specifically, the burial benefits do you recall, are there? Are there other ways that you had learned about those?

P7: Seems like there's like a $250 something. I don't know if they've increased that to anything else. As far as the burial benefit. I know you get a you get a headstone and
engraved with, you know, whatever tattoos you have or something. Yeah, it it seems like you get you get that, and it may be $275. It seems like that was the case at one time.

Moderator: Okay, do you recall? How you had originally learned about about these burial benefits?

P7: Probably 30 years ago.

Moderator: Oh, okay, so.

P7: From the from the Onion Skin pamphlet.

Moderator: Okay, got it Okay. And is there anything? Do you ever see any any of those types of benefits mentioned now, anywhere?

P7: No, they kind of tap dance around that stuff mortality and the VA. They they really kind of don't want you to think about it. I don't think.

Moderator: Are there places leading off of that? Are there places? You would like to see these burial benefits mentioned?

P7: In terms of preference, I don't know. It seems, it seems like it would be usually when you're when you're putting somebody down the funeral home usually can. They usually streamline it before anybody actually has to go look. So it's it's kind of something that is literally a fate, a company, but let me see, I would surmise that it would. It would need to go somewhere on. No. It's almost like it's one of those dirty secrets that that you're gonna die. I mean, they make it very clear when you're in the military that you're supposed to avoid that as a consequence. But once once you're in this system. I I don't see a whole lot of of pointing out mortality. If that makes sense?

Moderator: Yep, okay. Got it. So it's not really mentioned a lot.

P7: Well, they don't handle it, you know. It's it's it's outsourced.

Moderator: Yeah, no, that. Yeah. That makes sense.

Moderator: Have you been involved in the planning of anyone's funeral before.

P7: Mm hmm..

Moderator: Yeah, okay.

P7: Oh, yeah.

Moderator: And did you know, ahead of time the deceased wishes?

P7: Yes.

Moderator: Good. How had you learned? What was that communication like?

P7: Oh, my! My dad said, you know, cremate me, and then my aunts and uncles came in and said, We can't do. We can't let you do that. So we fold. We ended up folding on that and putting them in the ground. He didn't get what he wanted, but his brothers and sisters did, and they're all dead now. So.

Moderator: Okay, so you said so you you knew what your father had wanted? How had you learned that while while he was still alive?

P7: Oh, he told me, and he had it in writing, and you know he he had a will and pre planning, and all that you guys should get into the pre-planning Suze Orman style with the living living will at all.

Moderator: Okay. So he had all that. And so did you when he did pass. Did you know where to look, to find, to find his wishes written down.

P7: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. They they were in a a bank box, and the whole bit.

Moderator: Okay, got it. And tell me about any thinking or planning on your own wishes for your burial. Is this something you have thought about? Where are you in that potential process.

P7: Yeah, I've got. I've got a bunch of burial plots in [REDACTED] that I doubt that I'm gonna use. So I'm considering, you know, getting rid of those. I've got a cremation deal. Some friends of mine here in [REDACTED] have a funeral home. And I, they they know they're gonna get me, so I that that's just kind of the way that's gonna be. They said it would probably be 600 bucks. So I'm I'm not. I'm not really all that concerned about it. The the only thing I'm really concerned about is that you know. I dropped dead here at the house, and nobody finds me for 2 weeks, and then then they have trouble selling the house.

Moderator: Got it. Yeah, that's valid concern.

P7: Yeah, yeah, because it it really impacts the resale value.

Moderator: Yeah, I would agree. Do you recall what prompted you to start, considering what your wishes would be?

P7: Probably 30 years ago. And you know, when when we were in the military, they said, You know, avoid dying, please. And we were like, Okay, we'll we can look into that. And it was kind of a thing. Well, what if? Well the military will take care of that if you get cooked. So that's kind of the way that is, when you're in. And when you get out there's really no There's really there should be something when you get out of the military, where they pretty much demand to know what you're going to do. If if you croak after they're done with you.

Moderator: Hmm, okay. Yeah.

P7: It's kind of it's kind of part should be part of the TAP system. See? When I when I got out there was nothing they gave. They gave you your last paycheck, and you know I was. I was a giant mess, and I just got a paycheck, and they said, You know. Expect to, you know. Expect, you know. Direct. Well, hell! We didn't even have direct deposit they make. They mailed checks to us every month. So it's it's it's a completely wacky, different world now. I mean, I I hate to be that guy. You kids get off my lawn.

P7: But what what was, and what is, is unbelievable. I mean, they they have like a 6 week program as you get out of the military where they cover everything from educational benefits to this, to that. You have to sign off on all this stuff over this period of time, and and when you get jacked up wounded, whatever. They have a process where your family is brought in. If you're incompetent or unable to they they just they've got it kind of buttoned down where it is a it's it's a whole life process as opposed to a big lighter process. You know. When you get done with a brick blick brick lighter, you just throw it away. Bye. I think the whole life and the whole health process that the Va. Is doing now is is very much a giant plus towards retention.

Moderator: Okay. Glad to know it's it, is. It is approved. Yeah.

P7: In in my process. People, you know, my people knew what had happened to me, and they would say, “Well, my kids, considering going in the military,” and I'd say, “Well, that's stupid. That's about the dumbest thing I can think of, but you know, do tell me more.”

Moderator: Yeah, okay, yeah. So you said, about like, 30 ish years ago, you you had, you had started thinking about your own, what you might want. For your burial. Was there anything? Was there any any sort of prompt? Because I think that you said that was after you are out. My, okay, do, do you? Do you recall any like what? What had prompted you to start thinking, considering?

P7: Well, my my father passed in 86, and you know, seeing how that worked. And you know, just being aware of, you know, pre need issues. Living will you know, actual will. This disposition of personal property? I mean that I was an only child. So everything went to my mom, which was not a problem. Excuse me. And then, when my mother passed in 2010, she had it absolutely dialed in to where I didn't i i didn't even have to think about it.

Moderator: Hmm, okay.

P7: So I've got no heirs and signs, and I'm single. I live by myself, and I really don't intend to give anything to anybody.

P7: I'll give it to you guys because you guys are cool. But yeah, it's it's just, I'm kind of in a posture of. I'm not in relationship. I've got 3 ex-wives that are all. I mean. They're all awesome. And we're we're all still friends. And actually they're friends with each other. So I introduced 3 really good friends to each other which seems really obnoxious. But it's true, and they'll and they'll probably each get 30% or whatever

Moderator: Hmm.

P7: Just. I just don't care. I've got. I've got one of them listed as the executor, and the other 2 is beneficiaries. So.

Moderator: Okay, got it so freso, I know you mentioned the will and some pre- need stuff. Is that so? Do you have wishes? How? How have they been communicated so far to people around you?

P7: Well, [name] has a copy of my living will and my DNR. And she's my emergency contact on a lot of stuff and she lives in [REDACTED], so she's not far from here, and you know the people here in my neighborhood. They they know me. We've got a really cool neighborhood. So we're all we all pay attention to when cars move, and when people are out of town we all check in and out with each other, and it's and they know my situation. So it's it's kind of I've I've got one that checks with me just about every day, just. And it's because we're friends, not because she's nosy.

Moderator: Yeah, great. So you had mentioned you you mentioned pre-need a couple times. So have can you tell me if if there's been anything with with the VA? That you have you have set up in in regards to pre- need.

P7: Not that I know of. I don't think.

Moderator: Okay, so the the we're now gonna discuss the specific benefit called the pre-need burial benefit. So before, are you familiar with that specifically?

P7: Oh, -

Moderator: So what it is. It is an application that you would fill out to see if you are eligible, to be buried in a VA National cemetery.

P7: Okay. I am.

Moderator: Okay. Oh, oh, you are! You are eligible.

P7: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Moderator: Got it, can you? What or like? How? How were you told that, or how? How do you know that already? I should say.

P7: It was part of well, it was part of my original disability finding package. I think, I think it was in. I think it was in there when I got when when I got out they they process. They processed me through the Department of Defense at 50%. And then I think I've got that information then, and then not not very long after they they ran me up to a hundred percent, and I think I might have gotten something then as well. That reiterated.

Moderator: Okay. So so with that, you were told that you were, you were eligible to be buried in the National in a national cemetery.

P7: Yes.

Moderator: Got it. Okay.

P7: And then they started a new cemetery in Tennessee, just west of [REDACTED], and I applied, and was part of the last 3 candidates to run it as the [REDACTED]. I didn't get the gig, which was probably a really good thing, but I was in the last 3 to run that. So I I looked at a lot of information concerning the process, and it and it wasn't that I would be digging graves and doing embalming or anything wacky like that. But it was just an executive director's position where everybody under me there was no embalming involved, but it was just working with funeral homes and making people aware that the that the facility was to be opened.

Moderator: Okay, got it. So regarding the the pre-need burial benefits, as you said, you've you were already told that you are eligible. Do you thoughts on how it might be, how the specifically the pre-need burial benefit eligibility might be useful for anybody.

P7: Oh, yeah, yeah, you don't have to buy a plot. You're not going to be with your loved ones or your ex loved ones, as the case may be, or your kids. So it's it's a little bit exclusionary from a familial perspective. But it's it's nice to know that if you end up in a home that you got a place to go. If you believe in that stuff.

Moderator: Okay, got it.

P7: Because a lot of this is, you know, ties back to, you know. I don't know if you'd call it ignorance, but I might as far as you know. The the Bible says that the body is but a husk, so if you, if you subscribe to that, then there shouldn't be any cemeteries at all. So it just depends. And I I don't care when I'm done using this thing, you know. I don't care what you do. You know you can prop me up in front of the City Hall as a as a as as a as a warning.

Moderator: Got it all right. So, jumping to a separate topic just for a moment, have you filled out forms through the VA before it could be either online or paper.

P7: Yeah, yeah.

Moderator: And went. So have they, have they been? Is it? Has it been a combination of online or paper? What what sort of forms? Have you filled out.

P7: Oh, jeez everything you could ever imagine!

Moderator: Got it. When you so let's talk just about the ones that you're filling out online.

Moderator: have you? I know you've already said that you? You are rarely at your desk. But are you for form specifically? Are you on your phone? Are you on your tablet? Are you on your computer. What's what's been the.

P7: Pretty much pretty much on my phone, because they have that neat microphone thing that will transcribe all your mess, and I really like that.

Moderator: Okay, good. Is that is that something you use every day.

P7: Pretty much. Yeah.

Moderator: Got it. Got it.

P7: I love that voice. Voice, transcription is just a license to steal.

Moderator: And so so let's say, any sort of form you filled out recently. What was your experience after completing it in regards to any next steps that you might have to take.

P7: Submit button.

Moderator: Sorry after. Okay, after the submit button.

P7: Generally a receipt, you know, if

P7: it I I like to. I like to get some

P7: sort of a lot of a lot of online forms. You send it.

P7: And you really don't know that unless there's money involved, you really don't know what happened to it.

P7: I had a I had something that I did in the middle of the night last night with, you know, an organization that I do business with, and, by George, they called. They. They sent me a receipt when I sent it at like 3 o'clock this morning, and at 8 o'clock this morning. By George, they called me, and I was, and I was like you people are so responsive. You're scaring me.

P7: you know, because I'm I'm not a big client, but they were, I mean, and this is a international company that shouldn't care about anything I have to say.

Moderator: Okay. So so they they had gotten back to you very, very quickly. It sounds like.

P7: Yeah, and see I I never expect anything out of the Va. Ever because.

Moderator: Just okay.

P7: You used to have, if you.

P7: if you sent them a form

P7: and checked on it 6 weeks later, they would say, we haven't gotten it, or they they got it, and we're working on it, and if they didn't get it you had to send another one and then check on it. 6 weeks later.

Moderator: Okay.

P7: And then, if they processed it, they would send it to you. And there was all this mailing back and forth, and they could say that they sent it, but they didn't, and then you'd have to start the whole stupid thing over again. And if you called them it was a long distance phone call.

Moderator: Who knows?

P7: He was.

Moderator: All that sounds not ideal. What is better for you in terms of everything after the submit button.

P7: If

P7: if you get a receipt or just a a fast little vip email thing that said we got it. We're working on it have a nice day? It's it's a comfort

P7: just to know that they, you know, that you just didn't send something out into the void.

Moderator: Hmm, okay.

P7: I'm a big. I'm a big fan of that, because every everything is so ephemeral

P7: with all this stuff that you're never really sure

P7: you're you're never sure until you get something. And even if you get something.

P7: and you're not really sure either. So.

Moderator: Okay? So you want, you want some sort of communication. What is what is happening? Got it? And then going back to the pre- need burial, eligibility, application. Let's say you were. Obviously we've already discussed that you are already eligible. But if you were to fill that out talk to me about what sort of communication you might be looking for afterwards, and just how important that might be or or not, as which is fine, too.

P7: Well, some, sometimes it I I guess sometimes it would be nice to know

P7: where you were going. I mean, not not just the cemetery, but you know, actually getting an assignation of a plot. But I don't think that that would be possible because of the rolling nature of people's demises or demises

P7: demise devices. I don't know if that's a word, but I think you know what I'm saying.

Moderator: I'm actually not sure what the plural of that is. Yes.

P7: To, my.

Moderator: I like that. Okay, so so you would want to know or sorry. I don't want to put words in your mouth.

P7: I don't see it. I don't see that as being a rational thing to expect from anybody.

P7: but I'm sure that people would want that. And it's just not possible.

Moderator: So. No, you mean like having a a plot. I just wanna make sure I understand.

P7: Yeah, having an assigned plot. Prior, I mean, if you were, if you were 40 years old and you wanted to sign plot, that would be logistically difficult to put you in the middle of, you know.

P7: 500 other ones that had already been used.

Moderator: Yeah. Okay. Good.

P7: Kind of first.st Come first.st Serve, you know. Yeah.

Moderator: So with the with the the pre-need burial. Eligibility benefit. Yeah, it does actually say, you're not reserving a specific plot.

Moderator: It is. You are eligible versus not there is also the opportunity to to do it for family members. So it's not. It's not just you.

P7: Oh, really.

Moderator: Another another option there to for anybody who wants to be buried alongside their family members.

Moderator: It is yeah, it is. It is another one. See any, I guess how like once you, if you begin in our pretend scenario, you are, you have decided to apply and you're waiting to hear back for what next steps would be, how how how important is it to you to to know what what the status of the application is.

P7: I would say that, generally speaking, if you've got a DD-214, the application approval would be almost instantaneous.

Moderator: Okay.

P7: I mean it. It. It seems like it would just get green lit from from the point of application. Actually.

Moderator: Okay.

P7: I I would, you know, in calling calling this pre need. It's a lot of people see pre-need as being the whole process of taking the carcass away, getting it, you know, drained and replaced, getting new antifreeze. And you know the the whole the whole process of embalming, because that's that's what pre- need insurance is. And I don't know if people would get confused, as it's the whole enchilada.

Moderator: Got it. Okay, so potential confusion there. Okay.

P7: Yeah.

Moderator: Got it.

P7: I'm I'm not confused because I know you guys don't hit these guys don't. Didn't mean to say you guys were doing this because you're just doing the website.

Moderator: Yeah.

Moderator: Send it to me.

P7: Yeah, I didn't want to get confused there. But I've

P7: I think that the VA should potentially look at contracting with like a National Funeral Funeral Service.
Like SSI out of Houston, they they actually own most of the funeral homes in in the United States.

Moderator: Okay.

P7: You. You don't. They're not marked as SSI properties. There's they still have the names of the old

P7: things in their doings.

P7: But SSI pretty much controls the entire funeral business in the United States.

Moderator: Okay, got it. So you had mentioned that you you would assume, since you have the DD-214, that it would be an instant approval for eligibility. If it were not, what sort of like, how important would it be to know where your application is in in the process.

P7: Oh, very very important.

Moderator: It's very important. Okay. Got it.

P7: Because by the time by the time you are looking at your eligibility you're dead. So it's it's it's usually your family that's that's trying to figure out what to do, or the state that you live in, or whatever coroner came and got you. If if they have some indication that you might be military. I mean, just some found creature on the side of the road. They're not going to do a whole lot of digging. But if they can identify you. Whoever gets a hold of you might do something, or if they don't know, they'll just do whatever they need to do to get you out of the way.

Moderator: Okay, so kind of related to that like, if you were to apply for this pre- need. And the the decision came back that you are eligible. What would you want to do with that information in terms of keeping it and making sure that those around you had access to that information?

P7: You'd have to. You'd have to print out a hard copy, I would imagine, or they would need to send you some some sort of a certification, or something that you could put stapled to your important papers, as they call them, or something.

Moderator: Okay, got it. And any thoughts on things that you would want the Va. To do to help facilitate that.

P7: It should be part of a like, a larger pre-need issue where you know you've got will writing and formats and forms. I don't know if they have that already. But it's most most people either have it and have already done it, or they're not gonna do it.

Moderator: Okay, yeah.

P7: There's there's really nothing. I don't think there's much in the middle where somebody's gonna get prompted to do it. It's it's 98%. I'm certain of families that establish the pre need, the need fopre-needed. But the ship already sailed.

Moderator: Hmm,

P7: You know, they're they're they're not. Nobody's really gonna scratch around about this unless they are eligible to go to Arlington.

P7: Now, if you're if you're good to go for Arlington, a lot of people know that that's that's real. And they're gonna go.

Moderator: Okay, we've got just 12 min left. And are you? Do you know how to share your screen on the zoom app?

P7: If you tell me, I will.

Moderator: Okay so tap on the phone or tap, and then. Bottom. There should be a couple options. You may have to scroll to the left or right.

P7: Says, share.

Moderator: There you go tap on that.

P7: I did.

Moderator: Alright! What's it saying now?

Moderator: Yep, exactly.

P7: I will tap that, start broadcast.

Moderator: Yeah, start, broadcast.

P7: Oops!

P7: 2, 1.

Moderator: Yeah, I think it's like. There we go alright. So just need to tap outside of that center block. There we go, perfect. Alright. I'm gonna send you a link. Okay, there we at the very bottom, Moderator, to meeting group chat. Go ahead and open that very long, URL. It'll take just a moment to load.

P7: I'm glad I didn't have anything weird on there.

Moderator: It's getting weird, I promise. All right. So this is just a prototype of this pre-need eligibility, determination. It's nothing about. This is real, of course. But go ahead. And so we're just we're just gonna look at at a couple of screens because we're going to pretend that you have already decided to fill it out, and I know I wrote down. But I forget if you, with forms that you filled out in the past, do you normally do it on your phone? Or is it more on the computer? I forget.

P7: Now it's pretty much phone.

Moderator: Oh, okay, got it. Okay. So same same kind of thing here. I'd love to get your thoughts from this page here. For supporting files on how easy or difficult it would be to complete the application. Given the information that you have here on the phone specifically.

P7: Okay. So I've done all the 6.

Moderator: We are pretending. Yes, we are pretending. We have zoomed along in the timeline. You've already filled out.

P7: Okay, says, supporting files. That would be 214. Applying for yourself somebody else mail fax files that's free. Pdf, they pay. Yep. Yup, okay.

Moderator: How how easier, easier, difficult would it be for you to upload the DD-214 from the phone.

P7: Should be fine. Take a picture.

Moderator: Okay. Great.

P7: Scale it down to megabytes.

Moderator: So obviously a a benefit would be. You can take a picture of the form. Do you see any other benefits in filling out this application on the phone.

P7: Well, I don't have to get up.

Moderator: You know that? That's that's true. I know it is a nice benefit.

Moderator: Alright.

P7: Contributing to my sloth.

Moderator: Okay? All right, you can stay still. Good. Any. Do you see any? Or do you envision any potential problems with using your phone to fill out a form like this.

P7: I don't.

Moderator: Okay, great

Moderator: scroll down and click the submit button there. So we're going to pretend that you already have submitted your application. Congratulations.

Moderator: There's my receipt.

Moderator: There's your receipt. So yeah.

P7: On the way.

Moderator: Yeah. So, continuing the conversation we had before, I know you, you yeah. You like to know that something has gone through other information or communication you might want. Once you've hit this pay, or now that you have hit this page.

P7: No, but I took a picture.

P7: You sure?

Moderator: Backing up. I like that. That's good.

P7: Yep, cause you'd never know.

Moderator: You never know. I know.

P7: And we've got oh, and we've got to print this page as well.

Moderator: Yeah.

P7: So boop!

Moderator: Okay.

P7: Yeah, yeah, not not much. Is actually gonna work here.

Moderator: You got you got a dead button. There, lady.

Moderator: there's all sorts of dead buttons, I promise you that. Yeah, this is just for facilitating conversation. Would there be any other ways that you might want to know about any what else is happening after you've submitted the application.

P7: No, no cause I'm again. It's it's the the pre need thing is

P7: unless you print it out and put it with your papers.

P7: The only people that are going to be dealing with this will be the funeral home people.

P7: And that's and that's just, you know, that's the backdoor logistics to it. I I completely understand what you guys are doing.

Moderator: Hmm.

P7: And and it. This has to be done because people need to to do this.

P7: But the from my experience, the

P7: see, the burial benefit is actually a dollar thing as well.

P7: Now is that covered in the previous stuff, that that there's a a

P7: there's a there's a dollar benefit plus a plot benefit as well.

P7: and the dollar benefit goes toward your cremation or your body prep, or something. Is

P7: is this something that you guys are covering as well?

P7: Or is this just the plot.

Moderator: This will again, I'll I'll turn that. I'll turn that around is that was that it sounds like that would be information you would want to know by looking at this here.

P7: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cause there, there is a dollar amount that offsets some of your funeral expenses

P7: that exists. And I'm and I'm kind of shooting this off the top of my head.

P7: and I don't know if that's of.

P7: If that's not a part of

P7: this. If you take the plot, or it goes toward the plot, or

P7: it just my my memory serves.

P7: If my memory serves.

P7: There's something financial that goes to the funeral home.

Moderator: Okay, so the so since obviously the the funeral home for some reason the the screen sharing stopped. I'm not sure what

P7: Oh, my, my, phone.

Moderator: See if you're able to get back. If not, we will. We will make do without it.

P7: Update. Allow Zoom Meeting face id to open. Zoom, it went to sleep.

P7: Okay.

P7: Can you see me.

Moderator: Not yet.

P7: I can see you.

Moderator: Yep.

P7: I can see the scene to speak. There we go.

P7: Is that it?

Moderator: Not not seeing your screen yet.

P7: Let's see.

Moderator: But that's right, you know, we'll just. I want to move on because we only have 4 min left. So once you have so after you've sent the app, I'm sorry you've sent the application. You definitely would want to know

Moderator: what is next. How about once any further thoughts on once the decision has been made like you are eligible. What would you want, or I guess, where? Where would you want to look for that information like that the the letter or certification, as you were suggesting earlier.

P7: Probably in a bank box, or in some

P7: box at your house or in a file.

P7: but there should. There should be a record within the Va. File system that somebody could access.

Moderator: Okay, got it and so.

P7: Like a repository.

Moderator: Got it? Okay, yeah, yeah. And how important is it? Would it be? Excuse me, for you personally to to like to have access to that eligibility, information.

P7: By the time I need it I'm not gonna be here.

Moderator: Well, let's say before you need it.

Moderator: how how important would it be to be able to to see it, to access it, and and maybe to share with whoever needs to see it.

P7: 0.

Moderator: 0, okay.

P7: I mean, it's it seems it seems like this is really more for

P7: the dependents and the people sorting out your mess.

P7: When, when everything's said and done, this is really

P7: I don't see a lot of people jumping up and doing this

P7: unless they are just critically, clinically bored.

P7: But you know it's it's something that is useful for people to have

P7: as just sort of a reassurance.

Moderator: Hmm,

P7: And I would recommend that people

P7: do it just to. So they stop bitching about the Va.

Moderator: Okay.

Moderator: Okay? So you said, it's not. It's not super

Moderator: for you to have it. But then the you'd want the Va. To have to have

Moderator: have access to, or to have to have it within, like your account. Your your information.

P7: Yes.

Moderator: Any anything else.

P7: Records.

Moderator: Health records. Okay, got it?

Moderator: yeah, would there? How about wrap up here any.

P7: Should be in the health records, because if if you pass and the Va. Is aware of your passing, that could be a notification process from your primary care provider to.

Moderator: Hmm.

P7: Give, give the illusion of care so.

Moderator: Got it. Okay? So like they would, they would know, makes sense.

Moderator: Okay.

P7: Once once you pass, it seems like

P7: the Va. Would be notified, and then they would kick back notices and

P7: relative information for the dependents or the you know the leftover people.

Moderator: Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, good. Well, we are just about at time. And those are all my questions. I'm just gonna check in with the team. Natasha and Jonathan, if either of you have questions, feel free to unmute and ask them. Looks like Natalie had to jump off early.

Moderator: Okay, it looks like. No, there, [REDACTED], is there anything else that in regards to burial benefits that you would like to share, that we have not discussed.

P7: It seems like there should be something that.

P7: And this would be an internal Va issue as opposed to a website issue. But there, there's there's something

P7: floating around in my head about the Pre. Need process that the Va. Should

P7: be. If they're not, they should be involved with the.

P7: you know, on the embalming side, and the mechanics of getting you to from from your house to the dirt.

Moderator: Hmm, okay.

P7: It's it seems like there's something in the middle there where they could be involved.

P7: Is I I know when some I've had several friends that you know passed abruptly as they do

P7: and the funeral home handled all of the dialogue with the Va.

Moderator: Hmm, okay.

P7: The family. The family didn't have to fool with it.

Moderator: Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, so.

P7: It's pretty cool.

Moderator: Okay, great.

Moderator: And want to check once more. Now that we've had the whole conversation are you still comfortable with us, potentially sharing a clip from today's session with our Va. Partners.

P7: Oh, sure, I'm I'm sure that people will be suitably amused.

Moderator: Excellent, very good. Well, certainly appreciate your time. Thank you. It's always extremely helpful to talk directly with veterans about about what they what they need and want, as we work, to help make experience better one little bit at a time.

Moderator: and I know Perigean is going to be reaching out, sending you a thank you note. And of course, if you know other veterans who would want to help with the research, send them our way. But that is all for me, and I hope you have a wonderful day.

P7: Now is, is [REDACTED] still with you guys?

Moderator: That's a name that I that I have seen. I have. I have not actually met [REDACTED].

P7: I've talked to [them] several times in various incarnations. There, you guys, are, you guys are doing something that is really important and don't, don't ever lose sight of the importance of what you're doing, because it makes a difference. It really does. And I can't emphasize that more. And being a part of this from being involved with this for 30 years, plus it's the work you're doing is completely important. Don't don't ever forget that. 

Moderator: Well, thank you. I appreciate you saying that.

P7: Hey? Sure, yeah, you guys, be careful. And I'll I'll see you guys on the on the next one.

Moderator: Sounds good. All right. Take care!

P7: Thanks 

Moderator: Bye.
