# P9


[Moderator] : To record.  : Okay? So to confirm, are you comfortable? If I record, as we talk today.

[P9] : Yes.

[Moderator] : Okay, great. And are you okay? If we potentially use clips from the session to share with the Va partners.

[P9] : Yes.

[Moderator] : Okay, great. So now I'd love to hear just a tiny bit about yourself as a veteran. What branch of the military did you serve? And when did you retire or separate?

[P9] : I was in the navy, 91 to 97.

[Moderator] : Okay, great. Excuse me. And can you tell me about what sort of involvement you have with the Va. It could be both past. And now.

[P9] : I go to the Va. For all my health care.

[Moderator] : Okay, great.  : And do you? How much, if at all? Do you use the Va website and or the app.

[P9] : I well as needed. But most of my interactions with the Va. Start with the app.

[Moderator] : Is it? Oh, yeah, okay.

[P9] : Or the website.  : I'm at.

[Moderator] : Okay? And can you? So it said, you said, depending on on where you're at. Can you tell me when you might use be on the website as opposed to beyond the app.

[P9] : Well, if I'm home, I'm gonna use the website because I use my laptop. And if I'm out and about, then I'm gonna use something that I'm carrying my laptop everywhere.  : I hate using the phone because it's too small.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it.  : So besides size, are there any other reasons that you prefer to be on the laptop?

[P9] : I can see more at the same time.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P9] : More information is available to me, more options.  : I don't have to scroll through columns and columns of information to find what I need.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? Yep.  : And when you are on the app, when you're on your phone, what sort of things within the Va, are you doing on your phone.

[P9] : Maybe checking an appointment, maybe checking in a prescription, maybe sending a message to a fair provider.  : Maybe seeking information.

[Moderator] : Okay.  : Good.

[P9] : I also have done telehealth.

[Moderator] : Oh, yeah, okay. Got it?

[P9] : No.

[Moderator] : All right.  : So I'd love 1st speaking overall, of speaking broadly, rather of benefits within the Va. Now, you said you have all your medical with Va. How did you originally learn about the benefits that you are entitled to.

[P9] : When I was getting separated from the Navy, they  : they sent us to a mandatory separation class.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P9] : In California, and we had a person from the Va. Come and  : talk about what we needed to do to get hooked up with the Va.

[Moderator] : Hmm.

[P9] : And told us about benefits and whatnot.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? Great? And how about since then have there been other places that you have learned about any benefits.

[P9] : Other Veterans.

[Moderator] : Got it? And is that when when you say other veterans, where, where are you seeing other veterans that you're learning about these.

[P9] : Mostly at the Va.

[Moderator] : Okay, alright.  : And any any other place you're learning about benefits.

[P9] : Now that I've been around a while as a veteran, that I know there's state Va. Departments. Well, they're not, you know, state departments of veterans, affairs, things like that.

[Moderator] : Okay, great  : and and moving specifically to burial benefits. How much would you say you are familiar with with the burial benefits.

[P9] : I know they exist.  : I know, I believe I am entitled to be buried in a veteran cemetery.  : I believe there's some sort of I think I  : I think there's a form I need to fill out in order to determine that eligibility.

[Moderator] : Okay.  : got it. And do you recall where you might have seen any of this information that you just referenced  : or or heard of.

[P9] : The other thing that cause I'm a reader.  : I read everything, and there's always pamphlets with information.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay.

[P9] : When I go to the Va. There's bulletin boards with information, and I'm a person that stops and reads.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay.

[P9] : There are a lot of people that don't read anything.

[Moderator] : Got it. Okay? So you're reading everything. And so so it's, it's at these locations that you you believe you've come across burial benefit information.

[P9] : Yes.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it all right. Any any other place you might have come across burial benefit information.

[P9] : I get emails from the Va.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P9] : Oh, probably is on there somewhere.  : I don't know. It's record where I get information from. I just follow it away in my head.

[Moderator] : Sure makes sense. Okay.  : have you tell me about if you've been involved with the planning of anyone's funeral in the past.

[P9] : Yes, my sister.

[Moderator] : You have okay, got it? And did you know, ahead of time your sister's wishes.

[P9] : Mostly yes.

[Moderator] : Okay.  : Can you tell me how you knew about that?

[P9] : Well, my, there's 4 sisters on one of 4, and we have all expressed our wishes to each other. This one that died happened to be the only one without children, so she knew it would fall on the sisters if she died first.st  : Which is what happened. And so she made it clear that she wanted to be cremated, and  : you know, didn't want end of life stuff stuff like that didn't care what we did after that, but.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay. And how do you recall how exactly your sister had communicated this with all of you?

[P9] : Probably doing family gatherings. You know, the topic would come up because we're all obviously aging.

[Moderator] : Okay. And so was this, all communicated verbally, was there anything written down, do you recall.

[P9] : No, it was all verbal.

[Moderator] : All of our okay? Great.  : Okay?  : And so, how about? Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

[P9] : I was just gonna say there was no fight there because she didn't have offspring. She didn't have a husband. She didn't have offspring, and we sisters were ready to do whatever she had wanted. We knew. So it was not a problem there at all.

[Moderator] : Got it. Okay, got it.  : and tell me about any I know. You said you've you've talked with your sisters. Tell me about any thinking or planning for your own wishes, like when that started, or how you've or who you've talked to about it.

[P9] : I have 2 daughters grown daughters.  : And I've made it clear to them. I don't want to be hooked up to any machines, and I don't want to die in a hospital. I want to die at home. And  : I said, you know, if you want to do my wishes.  : do this, but if you don't want to do that. You're I'm not gonna be here. So you handle it. Whatever's best for you.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?

[P9] : Yeah.

[Moderator] : And has this been all verbal communication? Anything written down with your daughters.

[P9] : I do have a will for my possessions where I want them to go, but, as far as you know, what you do with my body. When I'm dead, go for it. I do have an advance directive. I think it's called.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P9] : Yeah, is that what it's called.

[Moderator] : I I there! There is something called Advance Directive. Yes.

[P9] : Kind of like a living will. Don't hook me up to machines.

[Moderator] : Yeah. Okay, yeah. Yep, yep, I think that's that's right. Do you recall what prompted you to start considering what your wishes would be.

[P9] : Besides aging, I had a friend who was  : in a relationship with a man who had grown children, and they all gathered together, and the grown children were told, if he died first, st that she would be allowed to live out the rest of her life in the house, even though she had no on paper ownership.  : and what happened was, he died first, st and the children booted her out.

[Moderator] : Oh, okay.

[P9] : Cause they were her step. They weren't her children.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay.

[P9] : And so, and so, seeing that got you got you thinking?  : Yes, that I absolutely have to have it in writing and my wishes known. And again, once I'm dead, do what you want. But as far as my  : property and possessions, I'm writing that down.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it.  : Okay? And is that I know you mentioned a will. Is there any other place that you've written any sort of final wishes down? Or is it all in the will.

[P9] : I do. I got a book from somewhere, reader's Digest, or something, you know, like what to do when I'm dead.  : Yeah, where you know what insurance policies I have. You know all that stuff.

[Moderator] : Okay. Sure.

[P9] : Where's the? So you did a thousand bucks.  : I think it was from a church actually.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P9] : The church, gave a little talk and handed out those books.

[Moderator] : Oh, okay, so is it. Is this like a a like a book you filled out? Or or was this a guidance for what to what to do?

[P9] : Both. It was. I think they were trying to sell annuities or something.

[Moderator] : Oh, okay.

[P9] : So as going to their seminar, you get this free. What to do when I'm dead book.  : And that your offspring could use, or you know your heirs and successors could use when you were gone.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. So some some guidance there got it.  : Okay? So we're now, we're going to discuss a specific benefit to veterans. The pre-need burial benefit. Is this something you have heard of are aware of.

[P9] : Yes.

[Moderator] : Okay. Can you tell me what you understand about it?

[P9] : Like. I think I've already said. I believe there's a form that I would have to fill out  : to determine eligibility.  : And I believe there's certain  : like I'm pretty sure, cause I lived in California a long time, that there's no room in certain cemeteries out there. You can't be buried on Point Loma, but you can be cremated. And  : so there's certain criteria like that  : that. If I wanted to be in a certain place, I should know those parameters.

[Moderator] : Okay, yep.  : Got it all right in terms of so this this form, what sort of questions? And you've already you've already mentioned that there's probably not space in the cemetery that you are aware of. Are there other questions or information that you would want answered in regards to this form?

[P9] : Yeah, could I designate a cemetery now, or could I designate a place where I want my ashes, or what? I'm not certain what the kids will do.  : Grown kids.  : you know. So could I just designate that now? Or you know, say, if I live in Kentucky, can I be put in Arizona, or do I have to be a resident there? Things like that like who pays to transport my body to wherever it goes.

[Moderator] : You know? Do they chip in on any funeral expenses or.

[P9] : Cover it all? Or what's the deal.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?

[P9] : Or none. Yeah.

[Moderator] : Alright. Yeah. Also important to know. Alright and where do you think you would expect to find, all this information that you just referenced.

[P9] : Well, you know, I'm pretty sure I could Google it. And Google would send me to the right place. It would send me a lot of other wrong places. But I think I'm good enough at researching that I'd figure out which one was the right place, probably on the Va. Site itself.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?  : Alright. And do you have? I know you said, you've.  : you know you've, you've had many discussions with family members about final wishes, thoughts on what might prompt you to look into this form, this this particular form.

[P9] : First.st  : I'm not sure where it came from, but I'm pretty sure the form should be done while you're still alive.

[Moderator] : Yes.

[P9] : Yeah. Now, can you know, if I never did it? Can they do it when I'm dead? I don't know.  : So that would be something I'd want to know.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it.  : got it. And any any further thoughts for why? You might want to apply for something like this.

[P9] : To make it easier for the ones that are gonna handle stuff.  : I've seen enough people dying enough, families in grief.  : That the more the deceased does before they die, the easier it is for them. They just follow the code, you know. I mean, they walk the path.

[Moderator] : Yeah.

[P9] : But when they're in uncharted territory, they start fighting

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. So with with this form, after you apply, you, of course, would receive one of 2 decisions A, you are eligible. B. You are not eligible, so  : can you tell me a bit about like your your relatives having access to this final decision after you have passed? What! What would make things easiest for them?

[P9] : Telling them ahead of time.

[Moderator] : So okay,

[P9] : And also having everything in a central location.  : Now my friend showed me that she did it because she doesn't have any offspring, so her niece will be handling her affairs.

[Moderator] : Oh, got it? Okay.

[P9] : And it's like she has a whole folder what to do when I'm dead.

[Moderator] : Yep.

[P9] : And I said, Hey, let me borrow that, and copy your format and stuff.

[Moderator] : Got it, and would there be any? Oh, sorry were you talking.

[P9] : No, that's all.

[Moderator] : Oh, okay, and any any thoughts on anything you may want from the Va. To make sure that it's it's easy for your family.

[P9] : Hmm!  : I haven't thought about it.

[Moderator] : Okay  : and well, any app, now that I've asked the question is, can you can you think of anything that that you would? You would want the Va. To help with.

[P9] : Well, it would be great if there was like a website or something for the  : do you call them the heirs, or whatever you call them the survivors, a website where they could go and have all their questions answered.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay, got it.  : So jumping away from that form, specifically, have you filled out other forms through the va in the past.

[P9] : Everything you do with the Va. Is a form.

[Moderator] : Well, there you go. So yes, I'll take that and has it been  : online? Has it been on paper? What's been your? How you filled things out.

[P9] : Yes, I've done both.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? For ones that are online. Do I know you said you generally don't like to unless you're out. Do things? On your phone? Have you? Have you filled out any forms on the phone, or is it all been on your laptop?

[P9] : Could not say specifically, I think I've done the beneficiary travel claim or whatever it's called  : ETSS or whatever beneficiary travels, whatever it's called.

[Moderator] : I think I've done them on the phone.  : Okay, got it.  : And thoughts on filling out forms on the phone versus filling them out on your computer at home.

[P9] : It's way easier on the computer.

[Moderator] : Okay, I know you said, size of everything is a factor. Is there any any other factors.

[P9] : You know, even when you go from one field to another, or when you need to go back to the previous page, or whatever on the computer. It's readily apparent how to do that.  : Hmm, okay.  : like, just now getting on this zoom call, I could have done this way, simpler on my computer.

[Moderator] : Hmm,

[P9] : But you know, cause it. You have to scroll through different screens  : on the phone, whereas on the computer, it's all right there on one screen.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it.  : And so with previous forms, tell me about after you filled out the form in regards to any next steps, what? What sort of communication has there been in terms of what you should expect for next steps.

[P9] : For instance, with beneficiary travel the money shows up in your account, and it's it sucks because  : not that you can do anything about it, but they put money in my account, and I might have 6 claims out there for different appointments, and I don't know which claim they're paying me for.

[Moderator] : Hmm.

[P9] : When the money comes in. The account I have to go back to the app to find out.  : you know, to the website.

[Moderator] : Oh, so it's it's not. It's not clear like what the  : what, what the money being paid is for.

[P9] : Exactly.

[Moderator] : Oh, got it? How how quickly is there? Is there a response to your claim?

[P9] : Actually, they've really speeded it up. It used to take weeks and sometimes months for a claim when everything was by paper.  : And now this online thing is, it's come they've I've seen it happen in a few days.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it.  : And how about in that? In that waiting period? What sort of communication are you receiving in terms of? You know when when something next might happen.

[P9] : None.

[Moderator] : None. Okay. What would how? How does that work for you? The the receiving? No, no communication.

[P9] : I could go to the website.  : and I could look at the claim, and it would say in process approved for payment things like that.  : But I have to be the actor on that. They don't send anything.

[Moderator] : Got it? And is that something that you do check up on.

[P9] : What?

[Moderator] : Is is that something that you do check up on.

[P9] : Every now and then.

[Moderator] : Okay, probably.

[P9] : Probably when I'm filing another claim.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P9] : Yeah. Just scroll back and see.

[Moderator] : Okay.  : Alright. Is it so? Is that more like when you're when you're thinking of it, or like, How how much communication do you. Do you like to have in terms of the status of a claim.

[P9] : I don't really care.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay, great, that's all I know. So again. So jumping again to the the pre need form, pretending that you were filling it out. How important might it be for that particular claim, or form rather in terms of communicating what the status is.

[P9] : That's extremely important to know whether they received it, whether it was processed, whether the form was accurate, and you know up to, because sometimes if I didn't fill in a field or something, they won't approve it, because I didn't give them the correct information.

[Moderator] : Hmm,

[P9] : So that would be very important to know. And then you know that a timeframe would be helpful. Hey, we have 700,000 applications here. We won't know your answer for 6 months, so that would be helpful. Or if, hey, you know, we're working on the forms, you may have an answer. In a few weeks those things pieces of information would be very helpful.

[Moderator] : Any sense of how often so like, for you gave an example of it might be a few months any any thoughts of how often you might want to to hear the communication of the status of that form.

[P9] : I think monthly would work unless I had say a terminal illness or something.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?

[P9] : Right.

[Moderator] : Okay. Yep.

[P9] : So if they asked when I filled out the form, hey, do you need to know our answer right away, or are you all right? For now.

[Moderator] : Okay. Yeah.

[P9] : That would be helpful.

[Moderator] : Let them know.

[P9] : Like some emergency approval. Stat, you know, Path, if someone's dying.

[Moderator] : Yeah, yeah, okay.  : Got it. Got it? Alright. Let me I'm gonna send you a link in the chat here.  : So and I'm sorry first.st can you? Do you know how to how to share your screen on your zoom app?

[P9] : Yeah, on the phone.

[Moderator] : The phone. Yes.

[P9] : Let's see. Share. I found it.

[Moderator] : There you go, couple, step, process.

[P9] : Do you want me to share it now, or do you want me to open it up first? st

[Moderator] : So? Yeah. Why don't you? What? Yeah, sorry I I shouldn't have sent you the link already. My! My apologies. Within zoom. Let me 1st have you share the screen, and then I'll have you click on the link.

[P9] : Share screen.  : Everything on your screen, including notifications, will be recorded. Enable do not disturb, to prevent unexpected. I don't know how to do that, though.

[Moderator] : Are you on an iphone or on an android.

[P9] : Iphone.

[Moderator] : Okay. So if you scroll on from the top right corner, if you, I'm my phone. So I'm just if you scroll down in a diagonal way from the top right corner.  : You should have. Let's see.  : Not sure if I'll be able to see what you're doing.  : Try your scroll.  : See? It's not that. Go from the bottom. Clear all that. So I think. Scroll from the bottom up to to clear what you're seeing now.  : So try from the  : from the from the top, from very, from the very corner, the the top right corner.  : So if you get yeah, get back on zoom. And then with your finger from the very top right corner of the screen, yeah, there we go. Okay. So where it says the focus with a little moon.  : Yep. So tap on that.

[P9] : Do not disturb.

[Moderator] : Yep. So yeah, so so just tap on. There you go alright. And is that all.

[P9] : Only during the zoom? Or is that gonna.

[Moderator] : At the at the end. And I'm gonna ask the rest of my colleagues to remind me to have you turn this back on so, or turn this back off at the end.

[P9] : Bye.

[Moderator] : Yes, so yeah. So you're good. So then tap anywhere perfect. Okay.  : so yeah, we'll we'll we'll make sure to have you turn it back on the notifications at the end. So you don't miss. So you don't miss things.  : Okay. So now you're sharing your screen perfect. So now, if you can get to the chat, I think if you just yeah. So the chat at the very bottom, there's a little yeah, there we go. Tap that tap the website. So this is this is the actual Va website. Oh, this, the little rectangle you're seeing my face. You can  : scroll to the right to like like almost shoving it out of the way is what it seems like.

[P9] : Look at.

[Moderator] : Yes, yes, perfect. Yeah. There you go. It just gives you more more screen space. Okay? So we are on the Va burial benefits website here. I'm not going to have you read through everything because there is a lot. As you know, there's a lot of information on the Va site. But we're going to pretend that you are looking for information on preparing for your own burial. So really, just like skimming, skimming through  : any thoughts on the information that is here, and what you might be looking for, and what what would be important to you.

[P9] : I don't know. All this looks really interesting allowance benefits for Burial, Headstone or Mark. I didn't know any of that was available.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P9] : Benefits for spouse and tenants, bereavement, counseling.

[Moderator] : Oh!

[P9] : So that would obviously be for the survivors.

[Moderator] : True, true.

[P9] : Damn, I'm gonna die. I need counseling. Okay, plan, a burial schedule, a burial  : get. She has to wait for me dead.  : Yeah, I think so, plus the 2 14. Let's see.  : look at that burial schedule. Parents, rates.  : replace metals, or Oh, this is cool.  : I didn't know these things were available.

[Moderator] : Okay. Good. To know.

[P9] : Yeah, I didn't know I could replace my medals, awards, and decorations.

[Moderator] : Yeah.

[P9] : Oh!

[Moderator] : So since you've done a quick scroll.  : do you? Just really, just from looking at at the headlines, do you? Do you think that the information you'd be looking for in terms of preparing for your own burial would be would be here. Would that you would have things answered.

[P9] : Absolutely.  : Okay.

[Moderator] : And then, if you are going to like, fill out the form that we've already, we've already talked about  : from here, how would you? How would you go about doing that? I'm not gonna have you sign in or type anything. So this is more just.

[P9] : Well, it's right there, pre need. Well, you can see if you're eligible, and then here's apply for the letter.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P9] : Click.

[Moderator] : So yeah, so let me have you tap on that. And again, I'm not. Gonna have you fill anything out.

[P9] : The pre need one.

[Moderator] : Okay. So seeing this  : you know, you can skim through again and talk me through how easy or difficult you think it would be to actually fill out the application.

[P9] : I'm good at this stuff. I'm really good at forms and all that. So for me it would not be any kind of problem.  : And I keep  : keep things like, probably on my phone here. I probably have a copy of my Dd 2, 14 and stuff.

[Moderator] : Oh, you do. Okay. Great.

[P9] : Yeah.

[Moderator] : Not it.

[P9] : That I was an administrative assistant in a past life.

[Moderator] : So you you are pro at all this got it?

[P9] : An outlier, and you're gonna talk to some veterans that are. Gonna say, what.

[Moderator] : But I'm gonna.

[P9] : Stuff.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? So thought I know you mentioned that you like, there's been the the travel form you filled out on the phone. Everything else on your computer? How about for this particular form? Any thoughts on filling it out on the phone versus your computer at home?

[P9] : I don't know how hard it would be, but  : once again I hate using the phone.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P9] : I hate typing the little things, you know. I can type, you know, 60 words a minute on the phone. I'm like, tap, tap, tap.

[Moderator] : Yeah.

[P9] : If I do talk to text, it always comes out wrong.  : mumbling or serious, deaf, or what.

[Moderator] : Yep.

[P9] : Never comes out right. It's like I wasn't speaking. Swahili, siri, come on.

[Moderator] : Got it. Okay? So it sounds like you. You still would not want to. Want to fill it out here. And okay, you said it would be pretty easy to gather everything which is great and.

[P9] : See. But the younger people are gonna be opposite than me. They're gonna rather do the phone. They're gonna rather  : chat, you know.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay, can you? Can you say more about that? Why, why, you're assuming.

[P9] : Some people, you know, they have them when they're 2 years old. Their moms are sticking a phone in their hand.  : You know. So they grow up doing this, whereas mine  : demographic, I'm 65 years old. This is.  : It's not what I grew up doing.

[Moderator] : Got it. Okay.

[P9] : Yeah.

[Moderator] : Your experience. Okay.

[P9] : It's not an extension to me, but to them. The phone's part of them.

[Moderator] : Yeah, that makes sense.  : Okay, I'm gonna send you another link. So yeah, you'll go back to the zoom app  : and you'll grab that.

[P9] : Scroll up there this one.

[Moderator] : Yeah. So the one on the yeah, there we go. Yeah. So tap the very long link there.

[P9] : Wait!

[Moderator] : try try opening up again.  : Who knows? Yeah, try tapping on.  : Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah, okay, it's happening.  : It just will take a moment.

[P9] : Figma figma of my imagination.

[Moderator] : This.  : It's funny. I've been using Cigna for years. I've never heard anyone say that.  : All right. Oh, if you want to swipe my picture off the screen again.  : It must have reset for some reason. Okay, so this is, we're going to go through this. So this is all prototype. Nothing is real. Most of the buttons will not be working here.  : Okay, so I'm going to have you scroll down. We're going to pretend this is a couple screens of the application that we just looked at. So tap on the start. The pre- need eligibility application. And we're gonna pretend that you've jumped ahead to step number 6 of the supporting files. I know you said you've you believe you had the Dd 214 on your phone?  : You know, seeing this screen where you would upload the documents any any further thoughts on how easy or difficult it might be.

[P9] : It seems fairly straightforward. Click on that upload file. And yeah.

[Moderator] : Okay.  : so I know, you said that you would not want to do this on the phone. But do you see any potential benefits for filling out the application on the phone.

[P9] : Well, it would be immediate. And if I needed help, like, you know, from a Va work or something, I'm not gonna drag my laptop in there.

[Moderator] : Hmm,

[P9] : So yeah, I could get help way. Easier.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it easier access to help. Good  : alright, and let me have you tap the submit button on the bottom right there.  : All right. So we're going to pretend that you have. We're going to stay on the screen just for a moment. We're going to pretend that you have submitted the application. So this will be the screen that you get, saying that you have. What would talk to me about any next steps you would be expecting. Once you got to this screen.

[P9] : Well, it said, I'm gonna receive a confirmation email.

[Moderator] : Hmm.

[P9] : That you'll let me know if you need more details.  : And here's my! What do you call it?  : Receipt? Kind of sort of.

[Moderator] : Oh, yeah.

[P9] : Yeah. So this to me. I I don't have to go later. Did I do that or not?  : I could have a copy of what I've done.  : Yeah, okay.

[Moderator] : And hope you are good.

[P9] : And when I did it.

[Moderator] : Oh, yeah, yeah, okay. Got it. And would there be anything else that you would want from the Va once once you got from the to the screen.

[P9] : I think it covers it by telling me I'm gonna get a confirmation email. And you're gonna let me know if you need more details.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P9] : Cause. That's the important thing is like what happened. You know.  : And then on the email, I would anticipate that you were going to tell me.  : Yes, we've received your application and our turnaround time right now is this.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P9] : Obviously there's variations, and you know  : things that you don't think of but like. And I also like a drop dead date, like if I don't hear from you. By the end of June I need to get proactive. I've fallen through the cracks somewhere.

[Moderator] : So in in terms of like. So so you you would want to know the timeline on their end. So you would know when to act.

[P9] : Right?  : Okay?  : Because if they just say, you know, hang tight, we're going to get back to you. I need to know  : if that process broke, or something, or you know there's a fire in the mainframe, or whatever that I need to start over or follow up, or whatever.

[Moderator] : Hmm! No.

[P9] : I, if you say if you don't hear from us by June 30th or December 14, th whatever it is.  : I call it a drop dead date.

[Moderator] : Yep.

[P9] : Then I need to do something else, and I hopefully you would tell me what to do.

[Moderator] : I like that.

[P9] : Follow up on. Where's my application process?

[Moderator] : Okay? And then, so you have mentioned all that in an email any other way, that you might want to learn about the status, or the next steps, or the deadlines.

[P9] : You know the young people are gonna say text message. But me, I I just erase text messages unless they're from a person I mean I read it, and then I erase it.  : you know, and then they get pushed down.  : And there's no way to star them and recall them like I can with an email.  : But with the text message, I have to scroll through 10,000 text messages.  : And I invariably miss what I'm looking for the 1st time.

[Moderator] : Yep.

[P9] : Young people might not have.  : Yeah, younger people may be more adept at that.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay, so you would just prefer to. You do not want to text you, don't you want everything in the email there?  : Okay,  : And so let's say we're going to jump ahead in our pretend timeline. Here the decision has been made on your application. You have been told you are eligible.  : And what would you?  : Similar questions we asked asked earlier, but,  : any further thoughts on what you would want to do with this information after the the decision has come back.

[P9] : I want something to print out, and then I'd want something to direct my, you know, executive, or whoever.  : Where they need to go when I'm dead. What they need to do like they're just like you said. I need to gather these documents and  : etc, etc. You know I'd want that information available for them.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay. And when you say you want the information for them, what's your thought on? On how exactly you would want them to have it.

[P9] : Well, possibly when I filled out the form, you know, you're gonna you could ask for the executive, my state, and their email, or something or contact information. I don't know. I really don't know that one. I never thought about that.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay, got it. And then you said, Oh, go ahead.

[P9] : Well, I know it's they need to be proactive that the Va. Is not going to know I'm dead until somebody tells them.  : So they would need to know who to contact. You know. What do they need? Can they just call and say, Hey, she's dead, are they probably going to need my death certificate, or you know, maybe a will.  : Ma'am, executor, or whatever. What do they.

[Moderator] : Okay. So you you would want them to have direct, like, step by step, it sounds like of.

[P9] : Yeah. Why not?

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? Got it? And then,  : yeah, any any additional support you might want or expect from the Va. I know you said that they wouldn't know you were dead yet, so someone would have to tell them anything else you would. You would want help from the Va. For your loved ones.

[P9] : Well again, like I have advanced directives, whatever it is, with their names and contact numbers on it.  : You know. So if they wanted to send the form letter, or whatever  : sorry for your loss, and if you need help, here's where to go.

[Moderator] : We'll proactive reach out. Got it.

[P9] : Yeah.

[Moderator] : Let me have you tap on the continue button that's on the bottom there.  : and tap on the pink. Go to my Va.  : So a pretend profile of a person named Sammy Smith here. So, going back for the 1st timeline of you have already applied for the pre-need, and you're in that waiting period would, looking into your profile here. Would that be something that you think you would ever do in terms of looking for the status.

[P9] : Oh, yeah, that would be a great place to look.

[Moderator] : Okay. Thoughts of where you might want to look to find the status.

[P9] : Right here on this page looks great. See how it says, claims and appeals, and healthcare and outstanding debts. And why not put it there.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P9] : You know, benefit applications and forms. So why not stick that after that.

[Moderator] : Okay? And then how about after a decision has been made? So you have that that final letter? Thoughts on where you might look for that like for.

[P9] : Put a link to that letter here.

[Moderator] : Good.  : And so you you mentioned you mentioned a link  : would, would? There? I know you said you'd want to print out the letter. To have that.

[P9] : Yeah, weird.

[Moderator] : Documents and

[P9] : Well, what if I died in a fire and didn't have that one fireproof.

[Moderator] : So my next question, yeah, are there? Are there other ways.

[P9] : Blood.

[Moderator] : Want that letter to get to get to your loved ones.

[P9] : Yeah.  : Yeah.  : Now that you're reminding me, I'll make sure I have a couple of fail safes in place.

[Moderator] : Also important.  : Yeah, yeah. How? How else do you think you would? You would want to get that information to to your loved ones, that this, that they had it.

[P9] : Well, I would absolutely tell them.  : Cause. I've already talked to my daughters about all this because of the things I've seen in others.  : just friends and stuff, but movies or whatever. And so, as the family's like crazy.

[Moderator] : Yeah.

[P9] : So yeah, to to alleviate that as much as possible. I just said, Look, this is what I want, but you do what you. What's more convenient for you.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P9] : Seriously, don't go crazy. I won't be here.  : But and then I had a friend across the way, and we wanted to have a memorial service, and all the all her other friends were saying, well, she didn't want a memorial service  : for hers for us.

[Moderator] : Well.

[P9] : He didn't want it. So we're not going.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P9] : How am I gonna get you to know your story of her? You know what I mean. I didn't like that at all.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay.

[P9] : For the dead. It's for the living.

[Moderator] : Yeah. Yeah.  : So for  : since you you would any of our thoughts on how you would want your loved ones to to access that that letter that would come after the decision.

[P9] : Well, if they went to say My Va. Or va.gov. You know there should be a link there, saying, You know  : what a survivor can  : access. That's the word access. You know. I'm a veteran. I'm a this. I think there might be on that opening page.

[Moderator] : Okay. Yeah.

[P9] : I think there is now that I've said it.  : You know I'm a survivor of a veteran. What can I access? Obviously  : not. Everyone will have full access, like I do to me.  : Yeah. But there's gonna be certain things they're gonna need for insurance claims, or whatever.

[Moderator] : Okay? And let me have you scroll to the very bottom of this page here  : and tap on the go to va app  : and we have a a pretend app here. And then so similar question, after you have sent in the application while you're in the waiting period, would you want to look in the app for any status updates.

[P9] : Yeah. Why not?

[Moderator] : All right thoughts of where you what, where would make sense to you?

[P9] : Well with that activity, right claims, appointments, messages, prescriptions. Why not put it there?  : I mean, I know there's a place where I can get my letters and things.  : Okay.

[Moderator] : Got it so since you mentioned the letters. Is that something that that you pull up on your app sometimes.

[P9] : On the phone. No.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay, got it?  : All right. So bring me to my next question the the letter you would receive after the pre-need application. Would would that be something you would want on the app.

[P9] : Yes.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P9] : Yeah.

[Moderator] : Thoughts on what I guess, when, when you might need to have access to it on the app.

[P9] : Just to reassure myself that I have it because.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay, the older I get the more I forget.  : Yeah, makes sense.

[P9] : Can I actually apply for that.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay.

[P9] : Did I? Did? I dream it?  : Seen a movie? Yeah.

[Moderator] : and then from the app. Any further, thoughts on making sure that your loved ones had access to the letter.

[P9] : Well again, I'm pretty sure, on that opening screen and my memory stand, but I'm pretty sure you know I am a veteran. I am a family member. I've never clicked on the. I am a family member, one.  : So that's probably where you should put it.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P9] : Yeah, I'm a family member seeking information.

[Moderator] : Okay? So yeah, so having general information,  : is it meaning, just so, I understand, meaning like the family member would would reach out to the Va. And they could get the information.

[P9] : Right.

[Moderator] : Got it. Okay?  : Okay, any thoughts on. Let's say, if the family member  : didn't know to to call the Va. Any any thoughts on what the Va. Might do.  : To help in terms of getting getting that letter to to people.

[P9] : Huh?  : That's a very good question. How do they? How do they know what they don't know?  : Right. I don't know how you know what you don't know. I don't know how to get that information like if the Va. Doesn't know I'm dead. Why are they gonna reach out to anybody.

[Moderator] : Hmm,

[P9] : And if the people handling  : my affairs after I'm gone, don't know that the Va. Offers stuff, and I never told them. How are they gonna know to even look.  : So that's where that's at.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it.  : Okay? Those are all my questions. Just gonna check in with the team here.  : Natasha cat or sean. If any of you have any questions you can unmute and ask.  : Okay, it looks like, no. Is there anything else you would like to share? Lisa in terms of in regards to burial benefits that you have not yet shared.

[P9] : No get big weekend.

[Moderator] : Alright. Great! Well, this has been oh, and I just wanna confirm now that we've we've ended. Now that you've seen exactly what we talked about. Are are you still okay with us? Potentially using clips from the session for the Va partners.

[P9] : Good.

[Moderator] : Okay, great. And so really appreciate you taking the time. This has been extremely insightful and helpful. It's always good to talk directly with veterans about everything here.  : So thank you for taking the time I am gonna before we log off a reminder to turn back on notifications. So if it's gonna be that that same that same motion of from the very top right swiping diagonally down, and you should see the little moon again.

[P9] : Okay.

[Moderator] : And it should be just tapping back on, and then it will be you got it.

[P9] : Yes, thank you.
