# P11

[Moderator] : Double check.  : There we go. So to confirm. Are you comfortable with me? Recording as we talk today?

[P11] : Yes.

[Moderator] : Okay, great. And are you okay? If we potentially use any clips from this session today for our Va partners.

[P11] : Yeah, no. Problem.

[Moderator] : Hey? Thank you so much. All right. So first, st I'd love to hear just a tiny bit about yourself as a veteran. What branch of the military did you serve? And when did you retire or separate.

[P11] : Oh, okay, yep. Served for the army. And what did I get out? I got out in, retired in 19 yeah, 2,019.

[Moderator] : Okay, good and what sort of involvement have you had, if any, with the Va. Since then? And also currently.

[P11] : Pretty much since the day I retired.  : Yeah, so switched over to the Va. Stuff pretty much immediately.  : And now I go back and forth between the 2 for medical care, because sometimes stuff doesn't get covered. But.

[Moderator] : And okay.

[P11] : Yeah. So I've been dealing with online stuff. You know all the stuff that the Va pretty much from day one. So was that 5 years.  : Okay, got it. Okay? And when you say, dealing with the the online stuff, can you expand on that?  : Oh, like, you know, because you gotta go online to do your travel stuff. You gotta go online to do your prescriptions. You gotta get online to be able to communicate with the doc, because the docs only well, at least down here in [REDACTED] they can only see you, maybe once a year.

[Moderator] : Oh, wow! Okay.

[P11] : Yeah.

[Moderator] : Got it. And is that are you on the website? Are you on the app? Is it a mixture.

[P11] : It's a mixture. But most of the time, because the phone is, in my opinion, still small, even though they're the largest thing that we carry around, probably. But yeah, so most of this online, like on the computer.

[Moderator] : Oh, on the computer. Okay, got it? In, in what? In what instances, would you be using the phone for anything online?

[P11] : Quick reference stuff like if I get some crazy little text saying, they sent me a message back, or this that then maybe a quick tap in, just to see.

[Moderator] : Okay and any other. I know you said that. The the computer is larger. Are there other reasons that you prefer to use the computer when you're on the Va side.

[P11] : Well, for me, it's just  : being able to see all the the options or whatever.  : Yeah.

[Moderator] : Cause. It seems like on the phone, just like with anything I mean, I just try to order

[P11] : What a gift card on Amazon, or something for a birthday for a nephew, and  : I finally had to give it to the wife I'm like, Hey, you pick out what you need cause. I mean, it's just too small. There's too many options. It's too small, and you don't know if you're clicking on the right stuff and.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? Got it? So the times that you are on your phone for any Va items? Do you know offhand is, is that the app? Or is that the website.

[P11] : I think I have them both. But yeah, I couldn't tell you right off the head, which which one? It's probably the website.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. So so you see, said, when you're on your phone. For anything like, if you get a message or anything, you wanna quickly look up. Are there? Are there any other reasons that you would be using your phone for any? Va related items.

[P11] : Oh, yeah, I'm trying to think, yeah, just some of those. Virtual.  : I've done the virtual stuff on there with a couple of the doctors.

[Moderator] : Okay televisits. Okay.

[P11] : Yeah televis. There you go.

[Moderator] : Got it. Okay? Great. So I left a note, so speaking broadly, of of all benefits that you are entitled to as a veteran. How did you, or how how have you learned about them over the years.

[P11] : Well, most of them through my wife. She does all the research. Yep, she sees that stuff and finds all the stuff, and we got our you know, our daughter who she's in college now, and as she's, you know well, [REDACTED], so as she's going up through the ages. My wife's always keeping track of the benefits, and and how how she's covered until she's not so that kind of stuff. Yeah.

[Moderator] : Got it. Do you happen to know offhand where your wife does the research so that she keeps you all informed.

[P11] : Oh, pretty much. Online. Yeah.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P11] : And forums. She listens to the the different different forums, or whatever as well

[Moderator] : Okay, are. There are those forms, like through through the Va that shares about the benefits.

[P11] : I'm not sure. I don't think it's the Va. I think it's more of a  : like I'm going to say the Spouses Club, but it's not a spouse's club, you know what I mean. It's but it's similar to that. It's like the  : I don't know. I'll call it the word of mouth  : or dealing with past experience. You know what I mean. It's like.

[Moderator] : Yeah.

[P11] : You know, folks get on there and they start talking about different thing in their friends group. So.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay.

[P11] : I mean, yeah, in our, in our town, in our, at our age, in our town, if you're still here and you're around our age and this that without you're either still in getting ready to retire. You've retired, or you know you've had, you know, experiences with the military, because it's the aviation town, you know.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. Got it. Okay? So you said that most of the benefits you learned about through your wife, any any other resources you've come across personally where you've learned about the benefits.

[P11] : Oh, well, I mean, I have my stuff that comes in through my emails as well.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P11] : So whenever I see. So I just forward to her. And then she either tells me she knows about it already, or  : got it okay?  : Or it's something new.

[Moderator] : All right, all right. Good system. I like it all right. How about specifically for burial benefits? How much you know about them where? Assuming you learned about them from from your wife at all. But yeah, I'd love to hear just what you have learned so far.

[P11] : Oh, well, that kind of stuff I experienced, I guess, because my my grandfather was military. My grandmother was military, and and all that. So for the burial stuff. I just knew that they had requested to be buried in like a memorial type area.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay.

[P11] : With with the funeral services and everything. So  : yeah. So I've learned from a young age while I was still in the military that  : obviously, that that's available even after you're out and everything else, you know.

[Moderator] : Okay. So learn from from family, then throughout.

[P11] : Yeah, from experience, yeah.

[Moderator] : Leads me to my next question. Have you been involved in the planning of anyone's funeral? Either your grandparents, or really anybody else.

[P11] : Oh, yeah, with the my parents. Yep.

[Moderator] : And did you know ahead of time their their wishes? From.

[P11] : Yeah, pretty much they were pretty much like, yeah, no. They just wanted to be cremated and and no services.

[Moderator] : And was that how had that been communicated to you?

[P11] : Verbally, verbally, yep,

[Moderator] : Alright. And do you recall if there had been anything written down, or was it purely, verbally.

[P11] : my dad. It was all verbal stuff, and then for my mom, she might have put it in the will, but maybe not, or in her tensions, you know, as she was preparing.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?

[P11] : Yeah.

[Moderator] : Got it.  : So tell me about any thinking or planning. If if any you've done for your your own wishes for funeral burial, anything.

[P11] : Yeah, no, not really. I mean, you know, being a  : military family retired right? We moved so much that we're always moving somewhere else. And like right now, we're  : pretty much in an area where the rest of the family is not. And it's been like that pretty much our whole military career. So we're not really locked into, hey? I need to be  : put in the ground in this particular place or this, that whatever. So it's pretty much  : kind of like a leaves, you know, hey? Wherever we're at at the time of whatever is when we'll make a decision on so we haven't put much thought into it, plus, you know.  : we're still young.

[Moderator] : Got it? Got it? Alright!

[P11] : Thank you.

[Moderator] : Do you? I guess. Are. Are there are there any plans to to do any more consideration or planning, or anything along those lines?

[P11] : I think so, because, you know, just recently my mom passed away. So  : think with that brings in the mortality of all right. We need to like we learned, hey, man, let's put all this stuff on paper so that our daughter has an easy access to. Okay, this is everything we've got. This is what our plans are. This is what we'd like to do. This is where we'd like to be seen. And this is what we want you to do with this? That whatever. So probably I'd say, within the next year  : or so, we would probably have some thought. And input on, hey? We want to be, you know, buried here, or cremated and spread, or or what have you? Yeah.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it. And you said that was prompted with with your mom's passing. Has there been anything else that had that has prompted you to at least start start considering what you might want.

[P11] : I don't think so. Not really.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P11] : Yeah.

[Moderator] : Got it. Okay? So we're going to discuss a specific benefit to veterans. It's called the the Pre-need Burial Benefit. Have you heard of it? 1st of all.

[P11] : The pre need burial benefit? No.

[Moderator] : Yep, no, okay. So pre- need comes from the funeral home. Industry, and it's it literally means before the time of need time of need being when you're dead.  : So it's an application you fill out through the Va. If you are wanting to be buried in a Va National Cemetery, and you do the application. You find out if you are eligible for it, and then they come back with a decision. Either. Yes, you are eligible or no, you are not eligible.  : I guess, now that I've explained it. Have you? Have you heard of that anywhere in your readings and talkings?

[P11] : No!

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? Thoughts on thoughts on that. Does it sound interesting? Does it sound useful? Is it? Yeah? Any any thoughts that come up with that.

[P11] : Yeah, it might be interesting, you know, because we haven't really put a ha a lot of thought into it. But  : yeah, for us.  : because none of my other family members actually retired from the military, but you know they served in conflicts and stuff like that, so it might be more of an interest to be like, well.  : kinda like maybe we won't do the traditional thing that we've all kinda said, you know, cremated and spread in the ocean, or what have you? So maybe maybe we'll do something like that where it's more of a permanent place, sort of thing, you know.

[Moderator] : Okay, good and thoughts on what information you or what questions you might want to have answered. In regards to this, this pre need application.

[P11] : I know that I would qualify to be, and I just wouldn't know. Like to. My wife served also, but didn't retire. But yet. Yeah, so, but she is on [REDACTED] disability. So I I would  : venture to say that she would qualify as well, and and probably because of a spouse, she might be able to be buried right there. Anyway. I don't. I'm not sure how that works, but those are the kind of questions figuring out all the details of if we could be together or not.  : Yeah. And and since that we only have the one daughter, then, you know, I don't think they? Well, I don't know. Yeah. Could the daughter, if she was wanted to be there to type scenario, you know.

[Moderator] : Okay. So yeah, who else? Who else could be could be.

[P11] : Yeah.

[Moderator] : There, for example. Okay, got it.

[P11] : A couple of dogs cats, you know the whole thing.

[Moderator] : Family together.  : I like it. I like it.  : Okay. And any any other thoughts on like. Why, you might want to apply for this.

[P11] : I think I hate to say like you know, legacy, or  : or whatever. But it's almost like, you know, hey?  : This cat was here like when my mom passed the funeral place was like, Hey, you know, she said she didn't want to do this this and this, but that doesn't mean you can't still just have a  : like a little placard, or stone, or whatever edge, and you know, with their name and everything, so that  : generations down the road and be like, Hey, look.  : you know, here's your family, or here's the people that were here, and  : you know, and she was also here. So the name just doesn't get.  : you know, forgotten, I guess, in history, or something like that. Yeah. So yeah, for us in the military is like, yeah. Well, how come? We don't know much about these guys? Well, they were in the military, and they were traveling all the time, and they retired, or whatever you know what I mean. So it might be something like that.

[Moderator] : Okay, so making sure that info about family is passed down to everyone.

[P11] : Yeah, there, you go.

[Moderator] : And then, in regards to like, I briefly mentioned that with the application it would cut back as Yes, you're eligible or no, you're not eligible. How would you want your loved ones to have access to that information that, like, you know? Yes, this person is eligible to be buried in a Va national cemetery.

[P11] : Yeah, I would assume there would be some sort of  : obviously a paper deal. But then everything's digital nowadays. So with them, having access as well to the  : I don't know. Whatever the registry was, I'm sure they they would have. I mean, you would think they would have. Anyway, maybe I'm just projecting what I would think would be an obvious access point. But but yeah, being able to, you know, get on and log in and  : and make sure that you could see all their benefits as a dependent, I guess, which is not really. By the time I die she won't be a dependent. I guess it'll be your own.

[Moderator] : Okay.  : got it. So so, having something where your your family could be, could log in and see as as a relative of yours, that this this eligibility is there.

[P11] : Yeah, the only other way. I think that they would know, especially if they weren't immediate family.  : would be reading it in this this little book that that we have now.

[Moderator] : Okay? What what little book?

[P11] : It's almost like a well, literally, it says, Oh, fuck! I'm dead now. What? Or something like that, right.

[Moderator] : Like that.

[P11] : And then you open it up, and it's got, you know, all the information about all your names and this, that whatever, and then  : jobs addresses, and then wishes or you know, bank accounts insurance policies, that kind of stuff, you know all the planning for  : for what you know, somebody who, let's just say shoot! It's me my wife and my daughter and my daughter's the one we're account not knowing all the information. Well, now, nobody knows the information right? So the next person, my brother, or something who comes down and goes through the stuff would have find it. Open it up and be like. Oh, this is what he wants to do, you know.

[Moderator] : Okay, okay, so so it sounds like you. You would. You would put something in there.

[P11] : Yeah, I'd hate to call it estate planning, because I don't feel like we have an estate. But you know what I mean. Something like that kind of.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it, and is there. So I know you already mentioned originally that in terms of your family having access to this, and you would want them to be able to log in as a family member to see that you have this decision letter. Are there other ways that you would like the Va. To make it easier for your loved ones to have access to this letter, saying, you are eligible.

[P11] : Oh, yeah, like, if there was a registry or something, maybe they can punch into the  : National Registry and be like, Hey, he's, you know already assigned a spot, or already qualified, or or what have you? You know.

[Moderator] : Okay, some, some kind of some kind of registry. They can.

[P11] : Yeah, because I don't think that. You know, obviously, everybody's well. I shouldn't say everybody. But a lot of people are. Most people are pretty savvy on a computer. But some of these websites and logins and things that we gotta do.  : and they ask a lot of stuff before they even give you access. So so civilians are gonna need a  : like a easier right.

[Moderator] : The android access.

[P11] : Right. They don't get to see all the stuff, but they get to see that like the registry was anybody. Maybe it's public data or something I don't know.

[Moderator] : Okay? Got it? Yeah, that makes sense. Alright. Have you? Switching topics a little bit? Have you filled out forms through the Va, we'll go for a very broad question.  : Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.  : Have they been online on on paper? A mix? What's been.

[P11] : Mix. Yeah, especially, you know, starting back in 19, you know, as a mix of doing stuff online, filling out paperwork in person, you know, doing all their little briefings and stuff.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? The ones that you have filled out online. I know you've you've already said you've you tend to not use your phone for Va stuff? Have you? Have you filled out any forms on your phone? Or have they only been on your desktop computer?

[P11] : Pretty much anything that's got like a lot of information that's on the computer. So I can't say that I have not filled out a form on my phone, but probability is if it got in depth or felt like it was, gonna be a long time. We got switched over to the computer yet.

[Moderator] : Okay. Can you tell me why that is, especially in regards to something that might be that that might. That might take a long time.

[P11] : I call it fat fingers.

[Moderator] : And before.

[P11] : Phones, only like, you know. So and if you're not using a little stylus, or whatever right, it just seems like it's more complicated than it needs to be with my hands and and the phone. And then you accidentally hit one little thing. And next thing you know, you're like, you're off into something else, and then you can't get back to it, or what have you? Then, when you do hit back, it like goes way back. So for me. It's like, let me do it on a computer. I'm more familiar with it. It's easier. It's faster, less frustrating. Yeah.

[Moderator] : Not a good okay, and have you filled out any forms for anyone else?

[P11] : Or anybody else.

[Moderator] : Yeah.

[P11] : Gonna be 8.

[Moderator] : Maybe maybe helping helping someone fill out a Va form. For example.

[P11] : Well, yeah, but not necessarily on my phone. If that's what you're getting at.

[Moderator] : Oh, sorry it it could be it could be computer or or even paper as well.

[P11] : Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

[Moderator] : Got it. And how do you recall if that was paper or on the computer.

[P11] : Well, it depends on what stages they were in, but most of it nowadays it was probably on the computer for them.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay, got it. And do you recall, how easy or difficult it was to help someone else fill out those forms.

[P11] : Oh, it felt like it was easy enough for me, I mean, I wasn't typing the stuff in or doing. Doing. What have you. It was more of a  : what do you wanna call man? More of a contact to be like, hey, man, got a question about this.  : Okay? Got it? Yeah, running through the yeah.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? So with your experience, filling out forms have have there been some where, or I guess with, maybe let's take maybe some more recent ones. Where there was  : a waiting period after in in terms of what next step might be coming.  : So like, if you're if you're feeling something out, and maybe you're waiting for a decision or waiting for. I think you mentioned maybe travel, pay, or travel, or something.

[P11] : Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. Don't get me started on their old system of travel  : because you you getting paid for stuff. You don't know what it is. And you you filed so many that you lose track. You're just like I don't even know  : filing them, and they supposedly keep paying me. We don't know who's up or down, or if we're square yet or not. One of those things. I told him that for a long time ago, matter of fact, I had. I had issues even doing it online.

[Moderator] : Hmm.

[P11] : Because they they have me in the wrong location, because we move around so much.

[Moderator] : Goodbye!

[P11] : They assigned me to the West Coast. They assigned me to my home of record, and I'm in Alabama, so I couldn't even fill out my stuff online, even though I had been here for years, retired out of this area and was in the Va. System here  : doing medical stuff when it came to filling out those paperwork. It was  : assigned up there in Washington State, and so I wasn't able to like properly. Do the stuff. It took me months to UN  : to fix that, I guess you would say, and then and then it started to work a little better. But through that process I don't even know how I ended up on the White House, va line or something. And yeah, they they got back to me real quick. I don't know how. Yeah  : it was. It was pretty fast after that. But it was yeah. It was interesting and frustrating for a good few months there. Yeah. And then my complaint was.  : we filed. So many of these and so many of these are now quote unquote air quotes past the recommended period, or the timeline to get them in.  : Then they they just literally. I don't know if you're familiar, but they literally said, there is no. If you submit it, you will get paid because they they lost track. They don't even know.

[Moderator] : Oh, got it? Got it? Okay? So are there. What's the process in in terms of seeing any updates like, for example, with with travel. Yeah, do you? Is there a confirmation? Do you get notice on on status like, what? How are.

[P11] : No.

[Moderator] : Do anything.

[P11] : Not unless they change it. I actually kinda quit even putting some in because I was like, is it even worth it? It's like. Is it worth my time to even put that in? And then you don't ever know if you actually got paid for that one or not? And maybe they change the system by now, because I've been complaining about this since, you know, probably 2,000 19 2,020. But but yeah, I don't know it was. It's  : it got pretty bad. And they they fixed it supposedly, and it's more accurate. But.  : like I say, we don't know if we're on the plus side on the negative side, you know. None of that stuff.

[Moderator] : Got it? Got it? So in in a more ideal world, what sort of notification or slash updates do you do you like to see with any sort of form you're filling out.

[P11] : Oh, yeah, especially, I mean just going back to that once when it comes to, you know, you have to do so much to even  : get it into the system. You would like to be able to see it in the system. See the track where it's at under review this, that whatever you know denied or approved, and and then not just that.  : but paid  : because, yeah, denied or approved, doesn't doesn't really matter, you know, to the point. Where did you actually get paid? Sure you might have approved it. But how far back? Backed up are you guys, or whatever you know, when you get a a credit into your account. It just says us department of revenue or something. It doesn't say.

[Moderator] : Free.

[P11] : This date, travel.

[Moderator] : Okay. Good.

[P11] : You know what I mean. So you don't even know, and they might lump them together like sometimes I had a like, let's just say it's extreme. Number of 7 or 8  : came in at 6, 97, a piece, or 12, or 13 a piece, and then there's another times where I just get a lump sum of here is a hundred $31 for whatever it was, or something. You know.

[Moderator] : And you you had mentioned? I think, logging into your account. Where was that for? To like to see any update, to see any statuses, or something else.

[P11] : Yeah, if you log in on the Va deal for, and then you can click on a travel, and then you can kinda see at least what got submitted and sometimes you can see that it, you know, unsupported or denied, or you'll get a letter in the mail, and and somehow you're not even a hundred percent sure which one got denied, or how? Why it got denied, you know.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?

[P11] : You gotta do a lot of research.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? And is that that logging into your account to see status is that something that you do often with with any form you're filling out.

[P11] : Well, not anymore, because I'm pretty much established and.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P11] : There's pretty much nothing else except for doctor stuff that I  : need to do online for that, you know.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?

[P11] : But but in the beginning, when you're trying to get it established, and you're trying to get the Referrals, and you're trying to get the appointments and things you need.  : Then, yeah, you're checking to be like, Hey, where's my stuff? Where's the status of this? Where's that at? Where's my referral? And even referrals. You can't even really see that, because it's medical, I guess.  : But you can't even really, all you could do is shoot off the messages to your nurse team, and the doctor.

[Moderator] : Yeah.

[P11] : And sometimes I'll get an email back. Saying submitted, submitted, submitted. But you don't even see the referral until  : I don't know. Month or 2 later, you know, if you see it, and sometimes you don't even ever see it. You call. They're like, Oh, yeah, you were approved. And it's been shot out to whatever. But you know how. Come? I never got a notification.

[Moderator] : Okay. So you want, you want more, more communication overall. It sounds like.

[P11] : Right? Right?  : Got it? Okay, fine. Yeah.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay, we're gonna move to a little screen sharing. Do you know how to share your screen through the zoom app of your phone?

[P11] : I'm not a hundred percent, because on my phone, I just see you.  : And apparently I'm not even sure if my videos on or off.

[Moderator] : It's it is, it is off. So if you tap on the screen, you should have a menu at the bottom.

[P11] : Oh, there we go!

[Moderator] : And yeah, one of them should should say, share with a little arrow.

[P11] : There it is!

[Moderator] : That's your video. Hello.

[P11] : Oh, okay, hey?  : Alright, let's see.  : Stop here. Oh, there, there, sherry, Yep,

[Moderator] : Maybe a couple of the steps after that, just

[P11] : Share screen.

[Moderator] : Yeah, share. Screen.

[P11] : All right.

[Moderator] : That may do a test. Okay, there we go alright, and we are in perfect. Okay? So I am going to oops just a moment sending within the chat. Here. I'm just gonna send you a link  : to the website so that should there. So there we go, Emily to meeting group chat tap on that.  : All right.

[P11] : Okay?  : Period.  : Let's see, chat.

[Moderator] : Yeah, so chat on the bottom. There. Yeah, there we go, the middle. Alright. So this, this is this is the actual website. Not a prototype. But I'm not. Gonna have you sign in or fill out any information whatsoever.  : As you see, burial benefits we're on. We're on the Va site here. So we're going to pretend that you are looking for information, for preparing for your own burial or funeral. I'm not going to have you read everything, because there is a lot but just kind of skimming through. Can you tell me what information you might be looking for, and maybe what questions you would want answered in regards to preparing for your own burial.

[P11] : I guess. Yeah, I mean, all of it looks good because I haven't looked at any of it so obviously the burial benefits. See what that all includes, and then more information and resources if needed to figure out other things. And then if it all looks good, then plan the burial.

[Moderator] : Okay?  : Sounds good. Okay? And let's say we're let's say you have decided that you are going to apply for the the pre-need burial that we had talked about earlier. Walk me through what information is here is this answering basic questions you might have, does it look like something you would want to apply for here.

[P11] : Yeah, I think so. I mean, it's 1 of those things that  : discuss with the wife, obviously. And then, see what  : our plans are because we don't really have those types of plans, because you know, her family's overseas in Ireland, and then we have family here in the West Coast. So we haven't really thought of it yet. But yeah, it might be something where we're  : figure something out.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? Let me have you go ahead and tap on that. That pre need eligibility, Link. It was. It was up a little bit.

[P11] : The eligibility, one.

[Moderator] : The the pre- need burial eligibility.  : the the second link below the the get veterans, burial benefits.

[P11] : Oh, pretty neat! Gotcha!

[Moderator] : Yep.  : Okay. Thoughts on the clarity of the introduction of this.

[P11] : Yeah, sounds like pretty much  : seems pretty easy, I mean, you know. Cause now, you're just in the planning process. So  : just helping you figure out what  : Guess what you need to do.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? And then thoughts on how easy or difficult this looks. If if you are preparing to actually apply. And again, I'm not gonna have you type in anything.

[P11] : Yeah, seems easy enough to me so far. Anyway, I didn't get into the weeds of the different  : topics. But  : click here, click here, click here, now, that's that, you know. If we were actually in it, maybe that's where the frustration gets in. If there's too many places you click here, then you got a reason more. Then you gotta click here and you gotta read some more. And then if you got a question about the 1st one. It depends on how they're opening up. If they're open it up in new tabs, then that's probably fine, because you can go back easy enough, but if it's 1 of those ones where you got to push the back button to go back, and it stays on the same same. I'm gonna call it a tab.  : Those are frustrating, because sometimes then you lose the information that you have  : originally that you were asking the question about. You know that makes sense. Yeah, but it's nice and I only know this because I'm shopping for a house for my daughter. And when you click on, let's just use. Zillow, for instance, every single one that you click on opens up in a new tab, which is kind of nice, because then you can fumble through them, and and do some comparisons, and this, that whatever, without having to go back back back. But.

[Moderator] : Yeah, yeah, got it? And and I know we already talked about phone versus computer. But thoughts on how you might want to fill this out. You know, online overall or and then phone versus desktop computer.

[P11] : Oh, yeah, online, for sure, because that's just easy and then it's on your time and then probably on the computer for me cause it's just bigger.  : Okay?

[Moderator] : Got it.

[P11] : Especially if I'm putting a lot of information in.

[Moderator] : Oh, sure, yeah, okay. Got it.  : And then thoughts on gathering information you would need. How easy or difficult does that look.

[P11] : For me, it's pretty easy, because I have all this kind of stuff already.  : Together, you know.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?

[P11] : Yeah.

[Moderator] : Your your d to 2 14. Is that something you keep? You said you. You have it together. Is that something you you keep like close by, or easily accessible.

[P11] : Oh, yeah, I mean, I I came in the military in in 89 and back then they were like, Hey, if you don't have a copy of it. It doesn't exist.

[Moderator] : Okay. Interesting.

[P11] : So that's before everything was online and digital and everything else. And pretty much it was on microfiche. So you kept copies of everything. I mean, I still have my original stuff from my 1st enlistment back in 89. So.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P11] : Yeah.

[Moderator] : Okay.  : Alright. So I'm going to give me just a moment. I'm gonna send you another link, and it'll come up on the Zoom chat. Let's see if we get the notification here. I may have to switch back to the zoom app, and  : you'll see the chat there with a new link.

[P11] : Oh, cut.  : Oh, okay. Yep.

[Moderator] : Yeah. So yeah, the very long link right there, we're gonna open up a prototype here, give it just a moment to load.  : So this is all prototype. Now, nothing is real here. So we're pretending that you have decided to apply. And this is this is a representation of the actual application as it would look like on your phone. It's just a couple of screens, because it is. It is quite a few screens.

[P11] : Let me have you tap the start. The pre-need eligibility application on the bottom of the screen. There.  : Okay.

[Moderator] : Okay, so we're pretending you have jumped ahead to step 6. You're very fast and getting up to the the supporting files. So I know you said that you like you keep your d 2, 14 along with like with other, or you have it easily available. Have you have you uploaded documents from your phone in the past.

[P11] : Not to the Va. I don't believe.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P11] : Yeah, I don't believe so cause most of my stuff. I'll save in a file on my computer, too.  : The digital copies of this stuff.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P11] : And it's easier to upload them from my computer for me anymore.

[Moderator] : Oh, okay, got it. Got it?

[P11] : Yeah.

[Moderator] : Thoughts on. Essentially it is. It is easier to up to to do so from your computer. How possible would it be, I guess, to to upload your the the documents to your phone.

[P11] : Yeah, I mean, it could be done. You know, even, there's probably easier ways. But even stuff that I want to that I have on my phone that I want  : on my computer.  : I just recently learned that I could just plug my phone into my computer. But before that I was emailing myself to my military email. And then I would go to my sent file and I would grab what I sent to myself and download it to my  : phone. Okay.

[Moderator] : And okay. So it's, it's.

[P11] : Or my computer.

[Moderator] : Okay. So it sounds like that that like, that's 1 of the ways that that you might get a digital copy.

[P11] : Yeah, it added steps, though. But I think that's also why I use my computer. Because then it's less steps. But but now I've I've realized as I'm trying to delete these millions of photos that are on the phone, that I could just plug my phone into my computer. And I can actually see it bigger and  : and navigate it, and and do it that way, too. So that's kind of good.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? So you've mentioned a number of downsides of filling out the form on on the phone. Can you? Are there any benefits you're seeing to potentially filling out this application on the phone.

[P11] : Oh, yeah, I mean, if you're not at home, not at your computer, or or you're on a public area. Then obviously on your phone. It'd be a lot lot better for this type of stuff.  : Yeah. And then the instant thing, especially if it's like, Hey, I need this to process that. Then you're out and about you could do it right there on your phone. So the convenience and the  : expediting this is is good.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? Got it?  : Okay, so let me have you hit the submit button on the lower right, we're gonna pretend submitting and congratulations you have submitted. So we're gonna stay on this page just for a moment. So we pretended you have submitted the application. What would you be expecting any next steps from here to be.

[P11] : Let's see confirmation in the email. That's what I was gonna say. And then  : mobile phone or mail, we have more details.  : Need more.  : Yeah, I guess.  : I'm not sure. If necessary, there's a tracking, I mean. At this point I would I would be checking for that email confirmation. And then, after that.  : based on what they say, you know, you should hear a response by for me. I just put it in my phone.  : Otherwise I'll forget, and that just means my calendar, so that I know. Hey, man, double check on this, you know, on such and such a date.

[Moderator] : Oh, okay, got it. Got it? Okay? Would there be anything else you might want from the Va. Besides the the email you referenced with the rough timeline.

[P11] : Not really. I mean, if  : you know, because we're just, they're just even seeing so for me. Personally, I know that you know all my stuff where I'm at, I I would qualify, but.

[Moderator] : Hmm.

[P11] : Let's just say for my wife or something, right? We're not 100% sure she qualifies. So  : I would just want it. Yeah, I guess a tracking system, so to speak.

[Moderator] : I'm contracting got it? And so this like this tracking system that you just referenced. How important is that to you? To like to to know where things are.

[P11] : Well, she's alive. It's not probably not that big of a deal, but you know as as you're in the moment of, if something happened, and you're trying to get it done and figure it out in a timely fashion. Then, you know, there's a little more pressure to be like, hey.  : how accurate is this timeline? Because we know it's the Va, so so for me, it was just yeah accuracy of it. And  : and hopefully, it's up to date.

[Moderator] : Okay? Yeah. As you mentioned accuracy. And the Va, what's been your experience in the past in regards to accuracy of timeline.

[P11] : Oh, yeah, it's very slow. Yeah, I mean shoot. I can only get in to see my doctor physically to see him. Maybe once a year.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay, got it.  : Okay. So we're gonna jump ahead in our pretend timeline here,  : and let's see. Oh, actually, I'm gonna pause. Right here is that so I know you said that you would get you would get an email and put a note in your calendar to check up on something.  : Would you ever print anything for for your records?

[P11] : No, I try to get away from that, because I'm I got file cabinets, but they're just full of stuff that.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P11] : I have to get rid of now. So no, I try not to, anyway.

[Moderator] : No printer.

[P11] : I really need it.

[Moderator] : Got it. Okay? Great.  : Okay. So we're gonna we're gonna jump ahead and pretend that the decision has been made. You have received word that you are eligible, and how would you expect to be notified that you are eligible.

[P11] : Oh, email is fine. But the Va. Likes to send out official letters. So then, that way, you have something in your hand that that shows that you're  : certified or qualified or eligible for such services. Yeah.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?  : So you said that you probably get an email ideally, how would you want to access this letter?

[P11] : Well, online is fine by me, cause then  : you always have to submit it  : generally online, anyway. So drag and drop, you know versus now I got to scan it in.

[Moderator] : Okay, and is that just over email or or another way to get it online.

[P11] : Oh, just it'd be from probably my, my va resource  : like Va access, or whatever where. It's the same place that I go. That would show like my  : my payments. I guess my eligibility, you know, because sometimes, when you apply for certain things, they want to see where your money is coming from. I guess.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay, got it? Got it? Okay? So.

[P11] : In that same same place like it's almost like the Admin site.

[Moderator] : Okay? And then I know we've already talked about how like how you might want your family members to have access to this letter. Any any further thoughts or other other ideas that would be ideal for them to have access to the letter.

[P11] : Yeah, it's a little harder on that aspect, because I don't think they have the Va access. So as a civilian trying to find that stuff if you don't have it printed or written down somewhere.  : But it would be nice to have that that registrar or Reg. You know what I mean, for anybody can link in because it should be public access, and then  : but they just have to know to even look there, cause I mean.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay.

[P11] : They're not. They're not military. I was military, so they don't know the benefits that  : I am authorized. So there should be something where a civilian can be like. Hey, my! Such and such! This is what I have, what are their benefits, or whatever.

[Moderator] : Okay? Good. Yeah. So I guess something that they can find out with the benefits any any other thing that you might want the Va. To, I guess, help with, and especially since you mentioned not all family members are military and would know what you're entitled to.

[P11] : Yeah, not that I could think of, I mean, I'm sure my wife would think of something, but.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it? Let me have you tap on the continue button at the bottom. Here.

[P11] : Oh, okay.

[Moderator] : Then the pink go to my Va.

[P11] : Okay.

[Moderator] : So this is a fake account here.  : So just further thoughts again, we're gonna go back in our timeline of you have put in the application. You're just in the waiting period.  : would having any status updates with within here. Would that would that be a place you would want to look.

[P11] : No, I mean I I guess this would be great cause. That's that's my claim right? There.  : Yeah, I would say, just  : maybe underneath that claim, I'm sure there's a status thing, right? Evidence, gathering review view, other details.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P11] : Yeah, that seems fine to me.

[Moderator] : Okay.  : got it? And then, after the decision has been made. So you know, the letter has been sent. I believe you said, yeah, that you you would want the letter with like.  : with other other things. Was that was that here you were talking about like within them. Iba.

[P11] : Oh, yeah, it should be here like  : let's see, this is healthcare debts. I don't know what that is. But  : but yeah, it should be all  : all here as well, like application for education benefits.  : I'm trying to think of what that is even called.  : But yeah, it should be.  : I would, I would assume. Right here is where it should be, cause I I can't remember where I have to go. It's always a process for me to be clicking in and  : and finding my  : my s. 1, will you say where? That's all my documentation. Right? So for that conversation letter, or the proof that I have income, or the proof that I'm 100, or it should be there. The proof that I have  : burial rights, or whatever you call it.

[Moderator] : Okay. So so you'd want you'd want it with other other proof letters.

[P11] : Yeah, yeah, I mean, and then on all your documentation type stuff.

[Moderator] : Yeah, okay.

[P11] : Yeah.

[Moderator] : That makes sense,  : and then let me have you scroll down to the bottom. I'm going to send you to one more screen.

[P11] : Okay.

[Moderator] : The the yellow go to Va. App.

[P11] : Oh, okay.

[Moderator] : Got a a pretend app here. Does this look familiar at all, have you? I know you weren't quite sure if you had used the app or not.

[P11] : No, this does not look familiar.

[Moderator] : Okay, that's fine. So this is what the roughly, what the the Va app looks like.

[P11] : Okay.

[Moderator] : But yeah. Thoughts on, would you? Might. Would you want to look here for any? We'll go for the the status updates after you've applied. But before a decision has been made.

[P11] : Yeah, I mean,  : looks like your prescriptions, messages, claims, I mean appointments. So for me, clicking in the 1st time I'd go to claims, and see what what claims I have.

[Moderator] : Excuse me.

[P11] : And maybe it would be under there, if not messages for something saying, Hey, you know we received your application. It's in process  : type scenario, and then accepted or denied, and then maybe even down here, where you know it already says, like your rating and compensation, and maybe a tab that  : you know. Who knows?  : What your other stuff is. Yeah.

[Moderator] : Got it? And then the the second question, the the final letter and I know, like on the myva profile. You said you would want to have that with other proof. Letters, thoughts on the app, in terms of accessing those letters.

[P11] : I mean right there next to disability rating. But maybe because it's a mortality thing. Maybe they like, oh, that's so far away. But but yeah, maybe right next to that, even disability rating 100% service connected boom qualifies for burial. What have you? You know  : there's there's so much stuff that we are qualified for.  : That we don't either know about, or even if we do know about, we don't use.  : Hmm.  : so you can't have, you know, 90 things, I mean. I guess you could. But it just gets too  : too too busy, too too many things to click on. You know what I mean.

[Moderator] : Okay, yeah, so.

[P11] : Maybe disability benefits because of. And then your percentage of rating, because that's where a lot of people get confused. I'm a hundred percent. So when I'm talking to somebody  : who might be 70%, they might not have the same.  : What do you wanna call it? The same benefit.

[Moderator] : Hmm, okay.

[P11] : Yeah, cause mine. Mine's all service related, combat related, and there's might be just service related. Not necessarily connect. I'm not sure how the terminology goes. But there's a lot of things out there where people are like, what do you mean? I'm not  : service rated. I was deployed, or what so.

[Moderator] : Yeah, yeah.

[P11] : Yeah, yeah.

[Moderator] : Since since you mentioned. Yeah, you know there might be. You might have like 90 things. How how important would it be to have this pre need eligibility letter like here in the app, for example.

[P11] : Say that again.

[Moderator] : So so, going back just a couple of minutes where where you had talked about there is, you're right there. There's a lot of information. There's a lot of benefits you're entitled to, so you don't want to have  : all the information in your app. But how important would it be to have the pre-need letter available in your app.

[P11] : Yeah, I mean, I guess.  : And for me, personally, it's not that important to have it in the app as long as I could click on where appointments, claims, messages, or something like that. Maybe benefits click.  : you click on that for what you qualify for.  : I mean, that'd be easy enough.

[Moderator] : Okay.

[P11] : But I think it's that this stuff is so generic for the for everybody, for the guy with 10% versus, you know everybody. I mean, it has to be that way right? So  : I don't know. Maybe they don't put something like that in, because not everybody qualifies for the same stuff, but I guess once you log in, it should be pulling. Once it sees your rating, then it should populate underneath your tab. Whatever you qualify for at this time, you know.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it?

[P11] : Yeah.

[Moderator] : And thoughts of let's say you did have that pre-need eligibility letter on your phone, within your app thoughts on how you might use that from your phone.

[P11] : Sometimes, you know, when you're asking questions and setting stuff up, you don't have all your stuff with you. Maybe you didn't bring your paperwork, or whatever, and then you just pull up the app, click on benefits and be like boom. See, right here, here's my letter of what have you? And then being able to share via email, or whatever.

[Moderator] : Okay, okay, so you'd want to be able to share it. To.

[P11] : Generally you gotta prove it to somebody else, you know.  : Yeah.

[Moderator] : Okay, got it.  : Okay, those are all my questions. I'm just gonna check in with my team members. If anyone has any questions for Gary feel free to unmute and ask them.  : Okay, no other questions. Is there anything else you would like to share regarding burial benefits that you have not already shared? Gary.

[P11] : No, I mean it's interesting to think you know  : where. So I mean, you know. Now. Well, you know, my mom just passed within the last  : few weeks. It's nothing that we didn't know was happening. But but yeah. So now, going through that process with her for the last year or so, just maybe kind of realize that we can make this a lot easier on my daughter.  : yep got it got it.

[Moderator] : Okay? So I just wanna double check again. Now, you've seen what? Exactly we've talked about. Are you still potentially? Are you still comfortable with us, using any clips from this session for our Vi. Partner.

[P11] : Oh, yeah, it's it's perfectly fine.

[Moderator] : Thank you. So that is it for me, really appreciate you taking the time. This is, it's super super valuable to be able to talk directly with veterans, so thank you for making the time. I do appreciate it, and I know Paragene will be reaching out with a Thank you. Note. I know they often invite you to invite others who want to potentially help with the research. But yeah, that is it for us today. So hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.

[P11] : All right. Sounds great. Appreciate you.

[Moderator] : Thank you, take care!

[P11] : Alright, bye, now.
