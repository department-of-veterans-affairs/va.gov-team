# P3

Moderator: So now that we've started the recording, to confirm, are you comfortable that if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? 

P3: Yes, I'm okay. 

Moderator: Okay, great. And are you okay if we potentially use clips from this session to share with our VA partners? 

P3: Yes, I'm okay. 

Moderator: Okay, great. Thank you. So first, I'd love to find out just a little bit about you as a veteran. What branch of the military did you serve and when did you retire or separate? 

P3: I served in the Air Force from, I'm sorry, from 1982 to 2005. 

Moderator: Okay, great. And what sort of involvement with the VA do you have? 

P3: I go to the VA for all my medical care. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. And do you use their the website and or app through the VA? 

P3: Yes, I use myhealth.vet. Okay. And I also downloaded it on my cell phone. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. All right. For what purposes are you using the website as opposed to the app on your phone? 

P3: Um, cause I'm always on the website at work. I can't have my phone. That's the main reason why I use the website. Cause I'm always at work, so much easier to use it at work. Uh, I noticed the website is quicker than the phone. 

Moderator: Hmm. 

P3: And my eyesight is not good enough for the phone nowadays, so it's just. 

Moderator: Mm hmm. Okay, got it. How about when you have since you mentioned at work, it's easier to be on your computer? How about and anywhere else? Are you choosing to do things on a computer or on a phone? 

P3: Um, I'm not on my phone as much, uh, but if I needed to use my phone, I'll use it. Like if I'm going to an appointment to the VA, I'll get that pop-up says, Hey, have you arrived to your appointment yet? Get that pop-up and then I go through all the questions and check in. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. Okay. So outside of checking in for appointments, are there other reasons you might use your phone for the VA? 

P3: If I'm with some friends and we start talking about VA stuff, I might pull it up and show them some cool things that you can do on the app. 

Moderator: Oh, okay. Got it. What other cool things do you show them on the app then? 

P3: I've shown that, you know, you can get a, you can send emails, security emails through here. Look at all your prescriptions. You can look at your records. So a lot of searching you can do on it. Not for a surprise. 

Moderator: OK. Got it. And these folks who just didn't didn't have the app yet. 

P3: Um, yeah, they didn't they didn't even have that 

Moderator: Okay, so we're going to speak pretty broadly about benefits available to veterans. I'd love to know how you have learned about the benefits that you are entitled to. 

P3: Um, mostly word of mouth, uh, I'm still working. I still work on a military installation with a bunch of, uh, veterans. Uh, so we just talk and talk and talk and everybody shares their stuff. Uh, my brother was in the Air Force, both of my brothers. So we chat, my dad was a retired military. So I've always knew about benefits, especially from my dad.

Moderator: Oh, okay. 

P3: And my brother. So. 

Moderator: Okay. So has most of your knowledge come from discussion? Has there been anything you've read about them over the years? 

P3: I mean, yeah, I read about them, I've subscribed to VA news, so I get the emails every day. 

Moderator: All right. 

P3: I just follow along and read, so that's helpful. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. Other, what would you say has been the most helpful in terms of resources for knowing about the benefits? 

P3: The most benefit? 

Moderator: Yeah, the most the most the resources you found the most helpful for learning about your benefits. 

P3: The VA sites are very helpful. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. 

P3: Just go, I just go to the VA site and I can search through there and find all the answers. 

Moderator: Mm hmm. Okay, got it. And then specifically about burial benefits. What have you come across in terms of that subject? What is available to veterans? 

P3: So, so far I've read that what's available for me is I can get buried at anybody that accepts VA burriers and I can, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think there's a limit of how much they'll accept, I think it's 1,500. 

Moderator: Oh. 

P3: Uh, I could be wrong. But from what I understand that I could, the VA will help me pay for all or most of my barrier. 

Moderator: Mm hmm. Okay. And do you recall how you first learned about this? 

P3: Um, I have a cemetery or near my house within walking distance. So I drive by it a lot and I stopped in there one time to talk to them about it. And she gave me some forms. 

Moderator: Hmm 

P3: And it had, you know, stuff about the VA can help and I just been scared to turn into forms. 

Moderator: Hmm, okay, got it. 

P3: One of these days I will go back there and get applications, I guess it's called like what pre-barrier, so eventually I'll probably go over there and fill out the forms and see what they say. 

Moderator: Good, I got it. So you said you just one day stopped by this cemetery. Do you recall what prompted you to do that to look into it? 

P3: Uh, like I said, I, I drive by every, almost every day. So I said to myself, you know, my day is going to come. So let me go ahead and see if I can prepare for it. Like, like my, like my dad did. He, he, uh, paid for everything, uh, ahead of time. So that when he did pass, nobody had to go and pay for anything. 

Moderator: Mm hmm. Okay, got it. So that leads me to my next question of how have you been involved in in planning funerals in the past? 

P3: I got as far as, you know, like I said, going there and telling them I'm a veteran and they gave me something. 

Moderator: Yeah, I'm sorry. I wasn't clear of other other funerals that were actually happening if you've been involved in in planning anyone else's funeral 

P3: Oh, have I been involved? No, I haven't. 

Moderator: You have not. Okay, good. Okay. So tell me, what sort of communication, if any, has there been with others around you about any sort of thoughts you have for your own wishes? 

P3: Um, when I bring it up to my wife, she doesn't like to talk about it. 

Moderator: OK. 

P3: But I tell her it's a fact, I'm not going to live forever, that I need to, you know, get these documents done, this planning done. Because when I do die, and if you're alive, you're going to be jumping through hoops and probably not do the paperwork or the right paperwork. So. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. 

P3: I keep trying to convince her to let me go ahead and do it now while I still have a heartbeat. I just got to find the time to do it. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. 

P3: And if the VA can help me and send me the paperwork, you know, I'm more than happy to, to fill them out. Just for example, my last VA appointment, the nurse gave me a form and said, Hey, would you like to fill out this form to help us decide that if you're in a position where you can't make decisions? Can we appoint somebody to make the decisions for you? So I fill out a bunch of forms that she gave me and I signed them and she took them.

So supposedly if if I go in and I'm in a state of a coma or something and can't make decisions, this form is going to kick in for my wife in order to make decisions. So if the VA's got any forms for me to fill out for when I do pass, I'm willing to fill them out. 

Moderator: Okay. Got it. So I know you mentioned like, oh, yeah. Thank you. Oh, are you back? 

P3: I am back. I don't know what happened, but everyone's still there, so. Okay, sorry about that. 

Moderator: [REDACTED], please continue. 

P3: I was just asking, you know, if the VA has that where they can help me with the forms or educating that I'll be, I'll be glad to get that. Or do I just got to go to a funeral home and do it myself? 

Moderator: Okay, got it. So I know you mentioned that when you were at an appointment, a nurse had brought you some forms to fill out. Have there been any other mention, I guess, of any other forms that you've seen, either people telling you or anything written anywhere? 

P3: No. No

Moderator: Okay. Got it. Okay. All right, so we're going to be discussing something you've already alluded to, a specific benefit, the pre-need burial benefit. So you're on the right track for that one. Can you tell me, it sounds like you at least roughly know what it might be, can you tell me what you might understand about the pre-need burial benefit? 

P3: Um, from my understanding that I can get, uh, buried or cremated at a facility that accepts the A. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. 

P3: Or any, or I can get buried at any VA cemetery. 

Moderator: Mm hmm. Okay. 

P3: And I think I read that even my wife now is eligible. 

Moderator: Mm hmm. Yeah, there are also other other family members who are who are eligible. So yeah, you 

P3: But is that only for a VA cemetery for the wife? 

Moderator: Yeah, that would be for if you wanted your family members buried alongside with you. So yeah, you would fill out this pre-need eligibility form to see if you are eligible to be buried in a VA National Cemetery. And then you would be, once you filled out the application, the decision would come back either. Just hold to be buried in a VA cemetery, or B, you are not eligible.

Here's the potential next steps. I know you want to make sure everything is set up for when you do pass. Any further thoughts on why something like this pre-need form might be useful? 

P3: You were breaking in and out, you're fading. 

Moderator: Oh, sorry. How is now? Are you able to hear me? 

P3: Yeah, now. 

Moderator: Okay. All right. I'm not sure what is going on today. 

P3: It looks like it wants to drop to you again. 

Moderator: You're not able to hear me now? 

P3: Yeah, I can hear you now. 

Moderator: Okay, okay. Yeah, I'm not sure what's going on. So making sure I don't touch anything at the computer now. But all right, let me just ask the question all over again. So I know you've already mentioned that you do see the importance of setting things up ahead of time before you pass so that anybody remaining doesn't have to worry about the details. With this pre need form, any additional thoughts to share on why it might be useful to fill out? 

P3: Um, not really. I mean, it is, it is important thing to do in your life. You got, you know, you're going to pass. So if I can fill it out now while I'm still living, it definitely would help. You know, my family members that are still surviving. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. 

P3: They you know, my wishes would be there and they know like for instance, I want to be cremated. Yeah You know that way they don't have to argue about what to do with me 

Moderator: Yeah, okay, got it. And thoughts on what sort of information you would be looking for with this pre-need eligibility? 

P3: And what was the question? 

Moderator: Thoughts on what sort of information you might be looking for with the pre-need eligibility. 

P3: Um, you know what, the, the, what to do with my body and where to put me. I mean, that's going to be on the form, right. 

Moderator: Let me turn that around. What would you expect to be on the form? 

P3: Well, hopefully those kind of questions what to do with my body and where to put me. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. 

P3: Where to bury me. 

Moderator: Okay. And anything else that you would want answered with this form? 

P3: Oh, if it would be possible for like wheels, I mean, cause everybody's going to jump through a wheel, but if it's everything's in one spot, it's much easier. Like, I don't know if it lawfully can be, but you know, the wheel of a person's wishes would be nice. 

Moderator: Okay, so have that together. Got it. Okay, so with with this application, after, as I as I briefly mentioned, after you filled it out, and it's been decided, you know, we'll say that you have been determined, you are eligible to be buried in a VA National Cemetery. Thoughts on how you would want your loved ones to have access to that information, that information being they are they are eligible to be buried in a VA cemetery. 

P3: Yeah, that would be good information. 

Moderator: Yeah, any thoughts of how exactly you would want your family members to have that information? 

P3: Yeah, I don't have no problem with them having access to that. I don't, I don't mind that for them having access. I only have a wife and two kids and I don't mind sharing my, my wishes with them. 

Moderator: OK, got it. Thoughts on how, in terms of logistics, how you would want to share your wishes with them. 

P3: like what email telephone or yeah yeah exactly

Moderator: What would be the best for you to make sure that they have that information? 

P3: Oh, email and telephone. 

Moderator: Okay, do you want to email? 

P3: Quickest way in technology today, not the mail, because that was the olden days. Now everybody has a cell phone. 

Moderator: Right, right. Okay, got it. And would there be anything you would either expect or want from the VA in terms of making sure that your loved ones had this information that you are eligible? 

P3: No, no, just just to let them be aware of it. Thank you. 

Moderator: Oh, to the family members? 

P3: Yeah. Okay. Numbers and emails. 

Moderator: Uh-huh. Okay, got it. And so jumping away from that specific form, have there been forms that you have filled out with the VA anytime recently? It could be either online or in person. Oh, that's right. You said you had filled out some forms at a recent medical appointment. 

P3: Yeah. I filled out that form. I filled out travel reimbursement forms. I filled out, because I'm 100% disabled, I filled out forms for my daughter to see if she can qualify for some of her education. What other form have I filled out? 

Moderator: It sounds like you've certainly filled out a bunch. And so let's say you mentioned a travel form. Is that something you fill out on a computer, on your phone, on paper? How are you filling it out? 

P3: I've been filling it out on my computer, but lately it looks like the VA fixed that problem of filling out the form and they asked the question. When you go to your appointment, it pops up with the question, would you like to fill out a reimbursement for your travel? You click yes or no, and if you click yes, it just says, you know, asking you your address. In other words, they're doing it now on the app real quick. And it's my last appointment at work because I didn't have to fill out anything. I just answered the questions and I got a whopping check for $1.96. 

Moderator: Excellent. All right, got it. Thought so since you've both filled fill out forms on your phone and on your computer. What are the benefits of each or do you do you have a preference of filling forms out on your phone versus your computer? 

P3: Um, I would, you know, I would prefer my phone because that was real quick as I was going to my appointment, walking, sitting there waiting, boom, boom, boom. Got it all done. Oh, that's a big plus for the VA to get that working. 

Moderator: Okay, so nice and speedy, always like that. I only know a little bit about the travel form, so after you fill it out, what happens next? Is there a waiting period? Is there something immediate happen? What does happen? 

P3: Yeah, just like yo, within within within a week, which actually within about five days, you'll get a direct deposit. 

Moderator: Oh, okay. And so between that five days after you fill out the form, is there any sort of communication about the status of that travel reimbursement? 

P3: No, all the questions pop up on a day of your appointment. 

Moderator: Okay. Got it. Are there forms you fill out? Back up. Since you said there's about about five days. Are you ever wanting or looking for any additional communication about the status of that travel of that travel form? 

P3: No, if it hasn't popped up in about three weeks, I get on my health.vet and send a secure email to the travel office and ask them and they're usually pretty good of responding. 

Moderator: Mm, okay, good. 

P3: Within two days and say let me check into it 

Moderator: Yeah, okay. So with the times that you have checked up, is there any way that you are reminding yourself to check back in with something like that where it's taking a little longer? 

P3: No. So what I personally do is I get an email from the VA that tells me a reminder email about appointment. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. 

P3: So I'll get a you have an upcoming appointment. So I leave that in my inbox until until I get paid for travel. Once I get paid travel, I deleted that what that's my reminder. That's the system I use. 

Moderator: Yeah, okay. That's, that's great. How about any, any other forms? Have there been other forms you have filled out with the VA, where there's also at least some kind of waiting period until whatever next step has happened? 

P3: So I do the same thing. I leave it, you know, in my inbox. And then, you know, like I right now I have like 20 emails in my inbox. Those are just that's the way I use my inboxes and reminders that I have to get back to that item. 

Moderator: Hm, okay. 

P3: And then after a certain period, because it has the date on the email either start inquiring about that or delete it or file it. So usually everything works out. The VA has been improving on responding and getting things done. And so I have no nothing in my inbox that that VA is on me right now. 

Moderator: OK, got it. And then so this sounds like you've got a system worked out. How does that system work for you in terms of keeping the emails in there for the inbox? 

P3: It works fine. 

Moderator: OK, all right. OK, so we're going to be doing a little screen sharing. Do you know how to share your screen on your Zoom app? 

P3: Usually you'll send me a link to share. 

Moderator: Yeah, I will, but you actually first need to share the screen, and I can walk you through how to do that if you haven't done that before. All right, go ahead. Okay, yeah. So if you tap on the Zoom app, and then at the bottom there should be something that says share with, I think it's a little box with an arrow on it. You may have to... Okay, yeah. So tap on that, and the screen should be an option there. Correct. Okay. And then is there a start broadcast that comes up next? Okay, yeah. So press start. I think it's just called start, and let's see if that works. Okay, yep. There we go. That is. So yeah, so you can just tap outside of that center box. Perfect. That is exactly what I needed.

Okay, so hang on just a moment. I am getting a link ready. Okay, so I've shared a link at the bottom, Emily to meeting group chat. So I'm going to send you to the VA site. So we're not in prototype mode yet. Yeah, so this is the whole burial benefits section on the site. I'm not going to have you read through everything because of course there's lots of information. We're going to pretend you are looking for information on preparing your own burial, skimming through. What information do you feel like you would be looking for? What questions would you be looking to have answered? 

P3: First one I'm looking for is to find out if the cemetery near my house is eligible. 

Moderator: Oh, okay. So you'd want to look for a specific cemetery. Other other things you might be you might be looking for. 

P3: Um the is it gonna cost me yeah the main thing is is the cost if i'm eligible for that cemetery near me what kind of paperwork would they need because because i'm a veteran i know they're gonna probably ask me to fill out a bunch of paperwork

Moderator: Mm-hmm. 

P3: Llike eligibility. Hopefully I don't have to give them a bunch of documents. 

Moderator: Mm, okay. 

P3: Oh. 

Moderator: Thoughts on the clarity of the information that is here in terms of finding out info on preparing your own burial? 

P3: What was that, dots of what? 

Moderator: Thoughts on I would say there's a lot of information so I'm not expecting you to to read through everything but What's your overall sense of how clear everything is here if you are looking for information on preparing for your own burial? 

P3: I mean, I'm flipping through it and it even talks about VA survival benefits, which is another good thing to talk about with my wife. Which is, uh, I thought was nice to see there. I did flip through and I saw that DD-214. That thing don't ever go away. 

Moderator: Is that something you have to use a lot? Do you keep that handy? Like what's your storage protocol, if you will? 

P3: Yeah, now I've downloaded it and keep it in my mailbox, I mean, in my Gmail, I've made a folder and it's called DD214, so if I ever need it, it's in that folder. 

Moderator: Oh, okay. Got it. So are you able to grab that also from your phone? Got it. Okay, great. Okay, that answers one of my future questions. So yeah, so thoughts on, yeah, like eligibility here, clarity on this page, on who would be eligible. 

P3: So I'm eligible 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. 

P3: And like you said, former spouse was eligible. So now I know why I went to visit my dad cemetery last year. And I noticed my mom was buried in his grave also. It also had my mom's name. So. 

Moderator: Oh, OK. 

P3: It looks like my brother was able to finally get that done through the VA. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. Okay, great. 

P3: Oh, let's see how to apply for veterans burial allowance. What's that? Oh, let's see what that is. Thank you. So, it looks like they answered a lot of questions. 

Moderator: OK. 

P3: So so I think my next step is I'm going to go to the cemetery next to my house and meet with them and see what kind of forms they're going to give me. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. Okay, let me have you back up, I think, two screens if I'm remembering correctly. You can also just tap the burials and memorials toward the top of your screen. Okay, yeah, and then scroll down. We're going to pretend that you would like to apply for the pre-need burial eligibility. So you can walk me through the thought process once you've decided that you would like to. Ananya mentioned you would want to go to the cemetery near your home. Do you have a sense if you would go straight there? Would you fill out something ahead of time? What's your thought process there? 

P3: Yeah, I would. I would fill out ahead of time. 

Moderator: OK. Got it. So let me have you I'm not going to have you fill anything out or not even sign in or anything, but let me have you skim through this and let me know your thoughts on how easy or difficult you think it may be in order to fill this out. 

P3: All right, so Social Security number, the date and place of birth is easy. DD214 is easy, which also has the discharge papers. Those two are related, so it looks like I had no problem filling out the application right off the bat with ease. I have all that. 

Moderator: Okay. Thoughts on how you would want to apply? 

P3: Alright, how do I apply, by mail, by fax, let's see, there's that form, get the VA form for 10,000 seven, so that's perfect. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. 

P3: I'm gonna sign the form that's good they put the form there I'm looking to see if there's an email. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. 

P3: Looks like it's either by fax or mail, right? 

Moderator: Would you, what would be your preferred way of filling out this form? 

P3: It would be email. I don't know if it I don't know if I can do that. Knowing me, I'm the kind of guy that likes to go to my health.vet and see if I can find a secure email address for these people and send it in but it's not. I can do a fax. 

Moderator: Uh-huh, okay, to first fill it out. Okay, so this one, oh, is there a, go ahead. 

P3: This one I would do the fax 

Moderator: Okay. Got it. So for this one, you are actually able to do the application directly from the website. Thoughts on that as opposed to facts, like you just mentioned. 

P3: I'd rather do it through the website. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. And thoughts offhand, if you would prefer to do it on your phone or on your computer. 

P3: I prefer a computer because I always have to zoom on my phone. 

Moderator: So for a size. Okay, and okay, I'm gonna have you getting another link. I'm gonna put another link into the Zoom chat, which let's see if a notification comes up or if you can switch back to your Zoom app. Actually, go back to all the applications. It's actually the, yeah, so scroll two to the left. Yeah, right there. Yep. And so click the very long link right there. Yeah. Okay, so that's gonna open up a prototype.

Give it just a moment. Okay, so this is, so we're in prototype mode now. Most of the buttons will not be working, but this is a couple of screens from the actual application for the pre-need. And we're gonna pretend that, even though I know you just said you would prefer to fill it out on your computer because of the sizing of everything, we're gonna pretend that you're filling it out here. So let me have you scroll down to the bottom of this page and click on the start the pre-need eligibility application. We're pretending you have jumped ahead. You've already done steps one through five, getting through, getting to the supporting files. So I recall you mentioning you have your DD214 in your email. Thoughts on potentially doing the form on your phone where you would have to be uploading that DD214. How easy or difficult do you feel that might be? 

P3: It's easy. Click the upload file. 

Moderator: Well, there you go. Easy peasy. Yeah. Okay. Do you see any, and again, I know you wanted to fill it on the computer. Do you see any benefits of potentially filling it out on your phone instead? 

P3: Any benefits? Yeah. Yeah, benefit is if I'm not at home, like hanging out with my wife at her friend's house, and they're all gossiping, I can just go in my little corner. Okay. And do it on my phone. 

Moderator: Okay. Got it. 

P3: Knock it out. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. Okay. And besides, we'll go the opposite end now, besides potential sizing issue of text and all other potential problems with using your phone for an application like this. 

P3: No. 

Moderator: Okay, great. So maybe tap the submit button on the lower right. All right, so we are pretending that you have finished the application. You are on your phone, we're going to stay on this screen just for a moment. So the application is done, you've got the screen. What would you expect the next steps would be? 

P3: I'm going to probably get an email saying that I submitted this, and then my next step would be, well, I'm the kind of guy who likes to save everything, so when I'm on my phone, I'll do a screenshot real quick to show that this application has been submitted, so I'm doing a screenshot, so I have it saved, but then I can also hit print this page and save it as well, and then click continue to see what comes up. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. All right, I'm going to pause. I'm not going to be clicking to do quite yet. How about so I know you've already explained your great system for keeping emails in your inbox in terms of tracking. Would there be any other ways you might want to learn about the status of the application? 

P3: Um, suppose, supposedly I can log into my VA account and it'll show the status there. I've noticed that I've submitted tickets before, like for say these bonds. 

Moderator: OK. 

P3: And when I click on my VA account, it shows all the confirmation numbers and stuff, and I can click on it, and it has details of it. 

Moderator: Oh, OK, got it. And is that something you do to check up on something like that? 

P3: Yep. 

Moderator: OK, got it. Great. So specifically for this type of form, the pre-need, how important would it be to know what the status is of the application? 

P3: But just like all of them, they're important. And like I said, I'll leave it in my inbox for about a month. So I don't hear nothing back. I'm pinging. 

Moderator: Okay. Okay. And then we're going to jump ahead in the pretend timeline. We'll pretend that the decision has been made on the application. You are eligible to be to be buried in a national cemetery. What would you expect in terms of how you are notified of that? 

P3: I expect to be notified, at least through my email. 

Moderator: Okay. Any other other way you would you would expect to be notified? 

P3: Uh, probably by mail 

Moderator: Okay, got it. And then so what Yeah, so once you are notified, there is a letter that says, you know, you are eligible, and some additional details. How so email, of course, would there be any other ways that you would want to be able to access that letter? 

P3: Through secure mail if possible, like my health out there. 

Moderator: Oh, yeah, that's what the the messaging that you can see through their app. 

P3: Yeah. 

Moderator: Okay. Yep. Got it. And how about for making sure that your family members have the letter what would be your wishes for that?

P3: Um, I mean, the mail, the mail is a good way. 

Moderator: Mm-hmm. 

P3: But if the VA wanted to really go another step, an email would be nice. But with all the hackers nowadays, that's why I preferred my health.vet secure mail. And then I can just let them know. 

Moderator: Okay. So from like from the secure mail, how would you want to get the letter to your family? Are you able to email through that to family members? 

P3: Yeah, I can dial. download it, save it and email through an attachment. But since my family members live, we all live nearby, I can just, you know, get it in the mail and then when they come over, I can hand it to them. 

Moderator: Okay, so more of a physical printout then. 

P3: Yeah, it's physical for me because everybody lives nearby still 

Moderator: Okay, got it. Okay, so you've got them in, in the email. Any other place that you might want to, to access the letter besides the secure email and then being mailed it. 

P3: No.

Moderator: Okay, good. Okay. And then maybe tap the continue button at the bottom there and tap the go to my VA. So we are in a pretend profile for someone named Sammy Smith here. So this is a pretend profile thoughts on we're going to jump back in time. After you've sent in the application for pre need but there's the waiting period. Any place in here, you might look for us or you might want to look I would say for status updates. 

P3: Well, just like the benefit application forms, it says application there. So, uh, just, just another little box there that would say status of, uh, the barrier would be fine as well. 

Moderator: Okay, would, would that be something I know, especially since you have your system with your emails, would something like this be useful for you? 

P3: Yeah. 

Moderator: Definitely. Any thought of how often you might check the status of that form? 

P3: I would check it weekly. 

Moderator: OK. Got it. And then once the decision letter, the letter saying you are eligible. How about potentially accessing that letter within your profile here? Would that be something that would be useful to you at all? 

P3: Yes. 

Moderator: Okay. And thoughts on when you might use the letter within your account here. 

P3 : When will I use the letter? I will use it immediately. 

Moderator: Okay, for messaging your family members or any other reasons you would use it here? 

P3: Would that be what? 

Moderator: So would that be for sending to your family members or any other reasons? 

P3: No other reason, just family members. 

Moderator: Okay. Got it. Okay. Any, and I forget if I asked this already. Any additional support you would expect from the VA in regards to making sure your family members had access to the letter or at least the information in the letter? 

P3: Now I'm just a big fan of letters having if you have any further questions please contact so and so at so and so. 

Moderator: Okay, got it. So let me have you tap on the Go to VA app on the bottom, the yellow box. So this is a pretend app here. So similar questions as I had asked with the previous screen for seeing after you've applied before decision has been made, thoughts on seeing status updates on the app here after you've applied for the pre need. 

P3: So your question is, but I'd like to see a status update on you. Would that be useful? Yeah, that would be useful. 

Moderator: Okay. Do you have a sense of where you might go to find the status? 

P3: on this one either claims or messages. 

Moderator: OK. Got it. And then once the decision has been made and the letter is here, thoughts on having access to that letter in the app here? 

P3: Yeah, that would be nice. That'd be useful. 

Moderator: Okay, thoughts on how you might use that access within the app specifically? 

P3: How would I use it? Yeah. If I needed to show somebody that I have been claimed eligible, I can just show it to them right here from here. 

Moderator: Oh, so you would want it on like on right here, right like near where it says disability rating? Okay. Got it. Um, any, any other place within the app that you think it would be useful, um, to have access to that letter? 

P3: No, this is fine right here. 

Moderator: Okay. Got it. All right. Those are all my questions. I'm just going to check in with Natasha. Natasha, if you have any questions you would like to ask, you can unmute and ask them now. Okay, I'll look that as I see as a no. Is there anything else, [REDACTED], you would like to share regarding burial benefits that we have not yet discussed? 

P3: No

Moderator: You did a great job. Appreciate it. All right. Thank you. And I just want to confirm now that we've had the whole conversation. Are you still comfortable with us potentially using clips from this in our readout report? 

P3: Yeah, I'm still comfortable. 

Moderator: Okay, great. Thank you very much. Well, I really appreciate your time. This has been super, it's always important talking to veterans about their experiences. So I appreciate you taking the time and walking through things with me and sharing your wishes and needs for this. So Perigean is going to be reaching out sending you a thank you note and also a little blurb. You can pass to other veterans who might want to help with research sessions. It's always important to talk to lots of people. So thank you again so much and I hope you have a great day. 

P3: Thanks. You too. Appreciate it. Thank you.
