## Background

Veterans can apply to find out if they are eligible to be buried in a VA national cemetery (pre-need burial eligibility). After the application is filed, they will receive a decision letter regarding their eligibility. This application form (VA Form 40-10007) is currently available within the authenticated section of VA.gov. Decision letters are mailed to the Veteran; there are no digital versions available within their account. 

The VA app currently lacks any features related to pre-need eligibility, such as:



* Information about the benefit
* Access to the application form
* Application tracking (status updates)
* Digital decision letters

Key moments from the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) include Putting Down Roots (taking care of my family), Aging, and Dying. This research aims to evaluate which aspects of the pre-need burial eligibility process should be integrated into the VA mobile app to better serve Veterans' needs.


## Research Goals



* Understand what prompts Veterans to think about their burial details so that we consider what information to provide to them.
* Understand how Veterans are learning about their burial benefits so we can consider where to provide information to them.
* Test the clarity of pre-need burial information on VA.gov.
* Understand the goals of Veterans for pre-need burial so we can determine what will be useful.


## Research Questions

Discovery Journey



* How are veterans learning about their burial benefits?
* What prompts them to consider burial options?
* Do they know about and understand the concept of pre-need?

Current Information Evaluation



* How easy is it to find information on pre-need?
* How well does the pre-need burial documentation on VA.gov convey the necessary information?
* Is it clear what to expect from the process?

User Needs



* What are the goals of veterans for pre-need burial?
* What specific tasks do they need to accomplish?
* How do veterans want to find and access relevant items for pre-need burial?
* How do veterans want to be notified of updates to their pre-need burial application?


## Methodology

We conducted hour-long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on March 7-14, 2025. These sessions were semi-structured and mostly conversational, with some usability on VA.gov (unauthenticated portion) for gauging comprehension, along with a prototype for discussing navigation and usability. Participants joined from their mobile devices and were asked about their knowledge of VA benefits and experience with funeral planning and wishes and shown the following pages:



* (VA.gov - unauthenticated) [VA Burial Benefits And Memorial Items](https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/)
* (VA.gov - unauthenticated) [Pre-Need Eligibility For Burial In A VA Cemetery](https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/pre-need-eligibility/)
* (prototype) [Simplified version of the pre-need burial eligibility form, My VA, and the mobile app](https://www.figma.com/proto/XW0MKGL4iuHHRChVFVD6mF/MFS-Pre-need-burials?node-id=24480-23451&t=v9R7xQIBvjTDzIfp-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=24480%3A20737&starting-point-node-id=24480%3A23451)


## Hypotheses and Conclusions



1. Many Veterans will not have heard of pre-need burial eligibility
    * Definitely true. Most had not heard of the eligibility form
2. Filling out the pre-need burial form will be too cumbersome for the app because of the paperwork that needs to be uploaded.
    * Likely false. Most would have no problem uploading paperwork either with searching for existing digital copies or taking photos.
3. Veterans will want to see updates of the application status in the app.
    * Definitely true
4. Veterans will want to have decision letters available within their VA.gov account instead of relying on physical letters to keep track of.
    * Definitely true


## Key Findings

Veterans want to plan ahead not for themselves but to make things easier for their families. They’ve seen the stress that comes with loss and want to lift that burden by having their wishes known and documents in place. It’s a practical, caring act that they are ready to take, supported by VA through the right tools, guidance, and communication.


1. Planning ahead for death is seen as a practical way to care for loved ones.
2. Personal experiences of loss are a strong prompt for planning, but urgency is often missing.
3. Most participants learn about their benefits through word of mouth, rather than VA.gov.
4. Awareness of pre-need eligibility is low, and is often confused with more comprehensive funeral planning services.
5. Existing burial content on VA.gov is generally understandable, but there is desire for clearer and simple communication.
6. Participants prefer phones for quick tasks, but turn to computers or tablets for anything more involved.
7. Participants desire transparency from VA, and generally have low expectations for communication.
8. Everyone wants a digital copy of their pre-needs eligibility letter.
9. Participants have a strong desire to ensure their loved ones can access important documents after they die.


## Details of Findings


### Finding 1: Planning ahead for death is seen as a practical way to care for loved ones



* As most had been involved in some capacity with planning others’ funerals, they’ve seen how planning ahead and communicating wishes lifts an emotional weight during a grieving time.

    > _“We've had loved ones that have passed away. You want to have your affairs in order because you don't want to leave anybody with a mess, because trying to make a decision during the grieving process is almost impossible. You want them to concentrate on getting over the fact that you're gone, not trying to take care of business.” – P2_
* They all see death planning as a very practical aspect of life, and think that everyone should have things in place for their loved ones.

    > _“You want to make it easier for the ones that are going to handle stuff. I've seen enough people dying, enough families in grief that the more the deceased does before they die, the easier it is for them. When they're in uncharted territory, they start fighting.” – P9_

### Finding 2: Personal experiences of loss are a strong prompt for planning, but urgency is often missing.

* 8 of 13 were prompted to start considering their wishes after witnessing first-hand the effects of planning (or lack thereof) before someone dies.
    > _"Besides aging, I had a friend in a relationship with a man who had grown children. They were told that if he died first, she could live in the house—even though she had no ownership. But he died first, and the children booted her out because they weren’t her children." – P9_

    > _"It was parents dying and brother and realizing what a pain in the neck this is. So, yeah, mitigate issues for other people." – P1_
* Those who have not planned anything are aware that it’s important, but don’t seem to have any urgency behind starting the process
    > _"The only reason I may have considered thinking about my end of life planning would be if I started to have a serious medical condition, and I know that I may not have time left, but I don't have those. I don't have any of those concerns at this time." – P15_

    > _"When you're under stress and you've got to make all these decisions, having it all done is just really nice." – P6_

    > _"[For their planning] No planning. I thought about it periodically. But nothing really established. I feel like I'm pretty healthy, and the idea of passing is far from my mind." – P6_

### Finding 3: Most participants learn about their benefits through word of mouth rather than VA.gov.


* Some read through everything to learn, but it’s typically not a source where they discover benefits. 6 of 13 cite VA.gov as a source.
  
    > _"The VA sites are very helpful. I just go to the VA site and I can search there and find all the answers." – P3_
* Learning about benefits is generally from word of mouth: family, TAP classes (Transitional Assistance Program), printed materials, and service organizations.
  
    > _"My father is retired from the Air Force 23 years and so this is something that I've always known about." – P2_
    
    > _"I belong to the VFW, I belong to the DAB. So I learned a lot through them: the emails they send, what we're eligible for." – P13_
* 8 of 13 participants said they had rarely come across any mention of burial benefits.
  
  > _"No, they kind of tap dance around that stuff. Mortality and the VA: they really don't want you to think about it, I don't think." – P7_
  
  > _"Honestly, I don't remember seeing anything. I believe when we go to the clinic or hospital, they should have a poster up or something, anything." – P12_ 


### Finding 4: Awareness of pre-need eligibility is low, and is usually thought of with more comprehensive funeral planning services.



* 11 of 13 were not familiar with the pre-need eligibility form
* Once they were told, they were vaguely familiar with the concept, just didn’t know the name
* 10 of 13 wanted to know about more comprehensive funeral planning services, never specifically about their pre-need eligibility. Such as:
    * What expenses are covered by VA
    * End-of-life documentation
    * Reserving a plot
    * Step-by-step guidance on the entire process of preparing for a Veteran burial
    <br>

    > _"A lot of people see pre-need as being the whole process, because that's what pre-need insurance is. I don't know if people would get confused as to think it's the whole enchilada." – P7_

    > _"I'd like to know about biodegradable options. I'd like to be able to see what their process is going to be." – P10_

    > _"What to do with my body and where to put me: that's going to be on the form, right? Hopefully those kinds of questions will be there on the form." – P3_



### Finding 5: Existing burial content on VA.gov is generally understandable, but there is desire for clearer and simple communication.



* The structure of the burials page on VA.gov is well organized, though some remarked that it was quite lengthy (4 of 13).
* 7 of 13 assumed they would be eligible (due to honorable discharge) and didn’t think they would need to apply
    * The way things are, lots of people wouldn’t fill this out (even if they knew about it) unless they were specifically told why it’s beneficial
    <br>
  
    > _"I've got a DD-214 and an honorable discharge, so do I really need to find out if I'm qualified?" – P2_
    
    > _"I haven't heard of that. I just assumed that it was an automatic thing: you're a veteran, you can be buried in a national cemetery." – P6_

* 3 of 13 did not know that some family members could be buried together
 
* The differences between Eligibility and Pre-need eligibility sections were not always clear
    > _"It says eligibility, and then it says pre-need burial eligibility determination. What is the difference between the two – aren't you doing the same thing?" – P12_

* 4 of 13 were confused by eligibility criteria (“Veteran who didn’t receive a dishonorable discharge”)
    > _"Why can't they just say if you received a dishonorable discharge, you're not eligible?... Why can't they just use the same wording [as on DD-214]: veteran whose character of service was honorable is eligible?" – P2_
    > _"The person qualifying who did not receive... oh okay wait a minute, let me reread that... oh boy that's so backwards. Wow okay I had to reread that. Yeah, that's very confusing, almost like a double negative." – P6_

* Simpler language was desired from 5 of 13.



### Finding 6: Participants prefer phones for quick tasks, but turn to computers or tablets for anything more involved



* Phones are convenient for short, on-the-go tasks.

    > _“[reasons for using the phone] Quick reference stuff, like if I get some little text saying they sent me a message back. There may be a quick tap in just to see.” – P11_
* 12 of 13 prefer computers and tablets for longer tasks like uploading documents or filling out forms, due to larger screens and easier access to saved files.

    > _“The My HealtheVet app: I've, I use that. I prefer to actually do it on my desktop. I have used the app; it's just too small. And if I put it on my desktop, I can see the whole screen and figure out what to do. But it's a little bit harder on the phone for me.” – P1_

* The pre-need application itself was described as very user-friendly by 10 of 13, and most participants felt confident about completing it, even on their phones.
    > _“I keep a lot of my important documents like my DD-214 on my phone also, so that looks pretty easy. And taking pictures of my ID card and things like that, so I could access them on my phone.” – P1_
* Most knew how they would upload their DD214 (8 of 13), but a few (4 of 13) didn’t realize they could take a photo of the document and expressed concern about locating digital files on a mobile device.


### Finding 7: Participants desire transparency from the VA and generally have low expectations for communication.



* 9 of 13 mentioned poor experiences with VA communication in the past.

    > _"I never expect anything from the VA, because it used to be that if you sent them a form and checked on it six weeks later, they’d either say they never got it or that they were working on it. If they didn’t have it, you had to send another one and wait another six weeks. If they processed it, they’d mail it to you—but sometimes they’d say they sent it when they didn’t, and you’d have to start the whole thing over again." – P7_
* Everyone wants to know that their application has been received, and 7 of 13 want to know what sort of timeframe to expect.
    > _"There's never a time frame given, so when you submit it, an expectation of now to infinity is all we can get." – P10_

    > _"It's extremely important to know whether they received it, whether it was processed, whether the form was accurate. Sometimes if I didn't fill in a field, they won't approve it. A timeframe would be helpful—'Hey, we have 700,000 applications,' or 'You may have an answer in a few weeks.' Those pieces of information would be very helpful." – P9_

    > _"I’d look for a confirmation email. After that, based on what they say about when to expect a response, I’d put a reminder in my phone calendar so I don’t forget. That way I can follow up on a specific date." – P11_

* 12 of 13 expressed interest in viewing the application status in MyVA or a mobile app.
* Most would check their status and view it as medium to high importance.

    > _"It helps because then you know that it's being worked on. So yeah, any information is good." – P13_

    > _"I think that's extremely important just to know, just to get it taken care of. I think it's one of the things that can be easily forgotten." – P5_

### Finding 8: Everyone wants a digital copy of their pre-needs eligibility letter.

* Easier to share with people than a physical copy

    > _"Maybe set it up as an attachment—like how I saved my DD-214. Something that could be easily forwarded to family members." – P5_

    > _"Oh, so I can forward it to my family members right from my phone. If we had text or something, there’d be a quicker way to get it out to other people." – P15_
* Faster to receive than a physical copy
* Many wanted it together with other decision letters within their account (10 of 13).

    > _"I’m thinking it would probably be in the same place where you go to get your eligibility letters and that kind of stuff — with the other letters." – P6_


### Finding 9: Participants have a strong desire to ensure their loved ones can access important documents after they die.

* Some would not depend on the VA and would make sure the letter is with all other death-related documentation (7 of 13).

    > _"If I get a copy [of the decision letter], the first thing I’m going to do is scan it and upload it. I’ll keep it on a flash drive, in the folder where I store my official documents, so I always have a copy I can look at if nothing else." – P10_
* Everyone would like support from the VA, knowing their relatives may not know what to do if they weren’t also Veterans. A few options:
    * A relative can log into their account
    * They could add next of kin or other points of contact within their account
    * There was a central location the VA provides for survivors of Veterans where they could find guidance for their situation
    * A public registry
    <br>
    
    > _"If there were an option to share with next of kin—like how Facebook lets you memorialize a page—that would be great. Just being able to say, 'Okay, I’ve done this, and they get access to it'—that would be helpful. Whether it goes to a funeral home, a lawyer, or whoever needs to handle your final arrangements, it’s useful." – P10_

    > _"If there was a registry, maybe they could punch in and see 'already qualified.' Some websites ask for a lot before giving access—civilians need easier ways to get in. Maybe it’s public data or something, I don’t know." – P11_




## Recommendations


* Provide timeline for the process of pre-need eligibility determination
    * Over half wanted to know how long they should expect to wait so that they’re confident the process was working.
* Add status updates to My VA and the app
    * Almost all would want to use their account to check the status of their application, referencing past frustrations with not knowing whether forms had been received or processed.
* Add decision letter to MyVA and the app
    * Everyone wants a digital decision letter to make it easier and faster for their loved ones to access crucial information.
* Provide a method for family members and other designated people of Veterans to access their pre-need eligibility decision. Possibly allow Next of Kin to be added?
    * Everyone wanted to ensure their loved ones could access their decision letter after death, especially if they were not familiar with VA systems and procedures.


## Recommendations for Other Teams


* Develop a strategy to share burial information proactively
	* Many Veterans have not seen or heard the burial benefits mentioned often or at all
	* Prompt all Veterans to start burial planning via outreach, not just those with personal loss experience.
* Clarify purpose of pre-need form
	* Most assume they would be eligible because of their honorable discharge status, and don’t know why they would want to apply.
* Revise eligibility copy for clarity
	* “Veteran who didn’t receive a dishonorable discharge” was read as confusing


## Technical Limitations

Currently, the only feasible mobile app functionality is the submission of pre-need eligibility forms. No development is planned for the service that provides pre-need burial data, as that system (EOAS) is being phased out. EOAS is expected to be replaced later this year by CaMEO, a Salesforce-based service. Once CaMEO is in place, we can reassess which APIs will be available for further development.


## Next Steps
- Review and share research findings with VA PO and relevant teams to ensure alignment on insights, recommendations, and their implications for the project.
- Document any new or unanswered questions from the research.
- Create and iterate on designs mentioned in the recommendations and conduct usability testing.
- Await the work mentioned in technical limitations to be addressed before implementation.



## Further research needed

**Assistive technology users**

Due to stage of our research, we did not include assistive technology (AT) users in our plans. Though we ended up with at least 2 AT users, we want to be sure solutions address the needs for all AT users.

**Younger Veterans and family members**

In this study, all but one participant was 55 years or older, which helped ensure our research reflected the demographics of Veterans and included older individuals who may face more challenges with technology. However, expanding future research to include younger Veterans and family members could be valuable, as it would:
* Help us design with the expectations of more tech-savvy users in mind
* Allow us to explore and validate ideas related to next of kin by including family members in our research
