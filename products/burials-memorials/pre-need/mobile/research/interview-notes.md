__Learning about benefits (all)__



* GI bill/college benefits
    * Known about since high school
    * Recruiters in high school
    * Is a voracious reader; reads everything about benefits
        * Read all about VRE (Veteran readiness and employment) to know what she’s entitled to 
        * Leared about going to school at half the rate if you can’t go full time (with a doctor’s note)
    * Most of what she knows now is from VA website
    * Heard about benefit from someone about home exercise equipment (treadmill) 
        * Took 1.5 years to get approved
        * Had to find proof on VA website to get what she was entitled to (someone at VA originally had told her no, so she showed them the rule) 

__Learning about benefits (burials)__



* From my family (father was Veteran) - lost a younger brother as a child
    * Her father knew that any minor children can be buried in his plot
    * 2 younger brothers buried before parents died
* Knew she wanted to be buried with parents and brothers (not married and no children)
    * When she buried her father (10 years ago), she took her DD214 to the cemetery and said “here, make room for me”
    * Originally the cemetery said they didn’t do that, but she showed them the VA site and they said okay
    * First went to the NCA (national cemetery association) to bring the DD214, then the local cemetery
    * Knew all this from the website
* Other places seen this info mentioned
    * Funeral homes will often say if they’re a Veteran they could be entitled to things
    * She thinks the DAV (Disabled American Veterans) or Military officers association may mention it in a guide of benefits
    * Florida veteran benefits guide

__Planning Veteran funerals__



* Knew father’s wishes ahead of time - had discussions
    * Brother was supposed to be executor but passed 6 months before father
    * He promised his father he wouldn’t be buried alone so they put some ashes near grandfather
* When father died, plan was to keep his ashes with her mother’s
* Soon she’ll be burying her sister’s ashes with grandfather’s
* When father died, they kept his ashes with mother until she died
* Father had already set aside plots since brothers were buried there since 1960s
* After mother died, she planned a burial a couple months later for both mother + father
    * Called cemetery and let them know date and time
    * Just needed to provide death certificates, since plot was already there 

__Planning / thinking for their burial__



* Will be buried in the national cemetery with family; has no children and no husband
* Has nieces that would make sure she’s buried properly
* In will - just have to put her ashes there, doesn’t care if anyone is there
* Do you recall what prompted you to start? 
    * Ran into some problems with the will, some money, the house after father died
        * Niece thought she was entitled to more
        * It was clear things weren’t 100% clear with the will
    * Helped parents with death
        * When father died, it’s hard to think of logistics when grieving
        * Got cremation arranged for mom while she was still alive, had to get them up from FL to NY
    * Mitigate issues for other people and make sure I get what I want
        * Doesn’t want to be left to someone’s whim who may not want to use money to pay for the funeral/burial
        * Does want: “I’m just going to put her in the garage… happened to my cousin”
    * “It was my parents dying, and my brothers, and realizing what a pain in the neck this is, and I know I’m going to die!”
* Informing others of wishes
    * They’re in her will
    * Niece was there at parent’s funeral - conversations were had
    * She has been putting together a binder with important things
        * Where money goes
        * Where Guide dog would go
    * Talked about family member who passed (niece’s mother) and nothing was organized “I will never let anybody do this for me. I hope nobody has to do this for me.”

__Pre-need burial benefit__



* “Not sure I know about that”
* [Emily explains] Understand the concept, but didn’t know the name
* Thinks she did this ten years ago. Not on the app. Took the DD214 to the cemetery. They already approved her to be buried there.
    * Doesn’t fully remember
        * May have physically taken paper to cemetery
        * May have done it on the VA website 10 years ago
        * [note: form on website built in 2017]
    * She already knows she’s eligible since she had an honorable discharge
* Found info on VA site
    * While parents were still alive but nearing end of life, considering where she might want to be buried
    * Researched to see how she would make it happen to be buried with them
* After she applied or filled out paperwork
    * Answer came back pretty quickly (maybe days)
    * Thinks she found the decision on VA website
    * “I wanna say it was a letter”
    * Can’t remember if she took the letter to the cemetery but did take the DD214
* Would like a digital copy that she could save and print out and put in binder, plus email to relatives
    * Hasn’t taken steps for cremation yet, waiting until she decides where she’s going to for community care (may be moving out of her state)
    * Digital card on Apple/Google wallet could be helpful
        * After someone dies, one of the most important things is to get access to their phone and email. After that you could act as them to get everything organized.
        * While going through all cards that would have to be canceled, it could be handy to have “You are authorized to be buried at a national cemetery” within the wallet
        * Currently has lots of things within her wallet, so why not that
            * Often goes somewhere without a wallet, or could lose her wallet, but never is without her phone
        * Digital VA card - same thing but thinks she needs to apply for that
* Would be helpful to have a “next of kin” registered with VA
    * When brother died, there was nobody to tell at the VA
    * When a death is reported to VA -
        * It would be nice to have next of kin listed that gets information automatically
            * VA asks who do you call in case of emergency, but that person isn’t given anything when Veteran dies
        * They didn’t seem interested when her brother died

__Technology settings__



* Assistive technology
    * Turned off Voiceover
    * Uses higher zoom level
* Zooms to read
* Had BVA card in digital wallet
* LOTS of notifications badges
* Asks Siri to read things to her
* Using Safari

__Preparing for your own burial on VA.gov (burial benefits section)__



* Went immediately to “Get Veterans burial benefits” 
* It’s nice how things are highlighted, it’s not a long paragraph
    * Even sighted people don’t always read
* Overall, info on burials is clear

__Pre-need information on VA site__



* I wonder how many people actually apply for that
    * She’s thinking: I know I’m eligible - I’m honorably discharged, get medical benefits, and 50% disabled so of course I’m eligible
* (After reading short blurb under Pre-need header) Thinks it’s good, but doesn’t need pre-need, I know I’m eligible
    * Family doesn’t know where DD214 is though
    * Makes it easier for your family members
        * This is listed, but it’s at the end of the paragraph. That’s the most important part.
        * Maybe something like “Why do I need this?” on website to convince people to apply
    * How long is it good for? If I got it 15 years ago, could it still be used?
* Prefers to fill out forms on the computer, it’s larger and the contrast is better
    * Zooms in and scrolls horizontally to read things
    * Sometimes has things read aloud: either with VoiceOver or with Safari
    * Faster on computer
* Tries to do things on her own
    * Usually help number will help if she says she’s blind
    * Or they’ll stay on the phone while I’ll fill it out
* Gathering items to start application
    * Didn’t see the list at first - scrolled up and down and then found it
    * This all confuses me “you guys know this” (basic information about her)
        * If I log into the account, the VA should know this
        * But can see why they might not have that information
            * Had a brother that never used VA; apparently they lost his records
            * I could see that - for people that had nothing to do with the military when they got out
        * Also understands if family is filling it out

__Filling out forms with VA (any form)__



* Filled out a form around 2021 when she went blind and went back to school
    * Many steps after that
    * Had a blind woman take a test with english and math test
* Oh I do this all the time - winter clinic, applied in October/November, they got back to her in mid-December
    * They send a packet in the mail and in an email: hotel room, plane flight info
    * Doesn’t need any other communication
        * There’s a person that responds pretty quickly to questions
        * There are folks within her local VA that can help her

__Pre-need application prototype__



* Likes that some info was filled in (“See there you go, they know who I am”)
* Likes the stepper
* Gather supporting files screen
    * Love it! I think I could do this
* Nice to mail or fax too
* Likes that she can finish application later
* Do you see benefits for filling out the application on your phone?
    * Keeps important docs like DD214 on phone so I could do that
        * Keeps photos of her important document on her phone
    * You can easily take a picture of the file except camera is the HEIC file
        * Great option to take a picture!

__Upon reaching “You’ve submitted your application”__



* I would expect to get an email saying what to expect next and who to contact in case I don’t get it
* Would expect to see on MyVA
    * Expect to see that she’s filed it and the status of where it is
* On app - might look in messages or claims


# Participant 2

__Military history__



* Air Force, separated April of 1988

__VA involvement__



* Goes regularly
    * For mental health counselor 
    * All healthcare
* Uses app and website - mostly all on phone
    * Check medications, check lab work, look at appointments, diagnostic imaging
    * Uses website more, mostly on phone
        * Once on there she goes over everything (all things medical mentioned above)
        * Reads blog
        * Sees what discounts are available - takes advantage of those
    * App is mostly for appointments and where they are
    * Doesn’t use the app as much because the website has everything
        * No hard reasons but mostly on the phone
    * If she happens to be sitting at computer she’ll use the desktop (e.g. receive an email from VA)

__Learning about benefits (all)__



* I got a letter - I’m 100% service connected – from VA outlining all benefits
    * Has military ID card, access to the base
    * She did extensive research when she first got disability benefits. “I was reading everything from everywhere”
* Learns mostly directly from VA 
    * Focused on the VA sites, as she trusts those will be the most accurate
* ODVA Oklahoma Dept. of VA - also lists benefits
    * Information isn’t always accurate

__Filling out other forms__



* Signed husband up for Champ VA since he’s retiring - discovered on website
    * Printed form from online to make sure paperwork was accounted for
        * Had to print to mail it in (no online option)
        * 8 weeks ago
    * Printed all paperwork also because it was easier to read on paper
    * Also easier because she didn’t have all his information in her phone - finding his info is easier when using a desktop computer
    * After mailing it in: called someone for help about what comes next
        * They’re 6 weeks behind, they were clear about that
        * Received a tracking number for the USDS website
            * After mailing, was tracking about once a week to make sure it arrived
                * Was tracking package weekly
                    * No reminder besides husband asking
            * There’s no communication from VA until they mail you something – no acknowledgement of receipt or status. If you don’t track it, you don’t know
            * You could pay to have them send a receipt (through method of mailing; nothing with the VA). Otherwise there’s no communication.
        * Will get an ID card
    * Felt no need for any additional reminders from VA. Things seemed very straightforward – if they need additional info they would tell you. Otherwise they’ll next communicate when they send you something. “No, I’m good. It’s just a process.”
* Can’t recall any form she’s been able to do online - had to print everything she’s done so far

__Learning about benefits (burials)__



* (What she knows) There’s a local VA cemetery you can go to when a Veteran has died, they’ll help you arrange the burial
    * They’ll do the flag folding, ceremony, play Taps
* How did you learn about them? 
    * Learned from family - father was military, she’s always known
    * Does Wreaths Across America which has burial benefits listed
    * VA website has an entire section about burial benefits

__Planning Veteran funerals__



* Did you know ahead of time the deceased’s wishes? How had you learned?
    * Yes, they’re pragmatic and we’re medical people - we see death every day
    * People have a tendency to do things with your body after you’re gone so you need to express what you want to the people around you
        * “Even though you’re dead and gone, you’re not going to know the difference. Still… [pause] what if you do?”
    * Every person has been specific on if they don’t want a wake, where they want to be buried, etc
    * All conversations - nothing in writing except for maybe her husband’s

__Planning / thinking for their burial__



* Trust and wills set up with her husband - wishes on their deaths written
* Has expressed desires with everyone who may be involved
* Do you recall what prompted you to start? 
    * Birthdays (getting older - no particular birthday)
    * As they’re setting up trusts and wills, they need to think about it
    * Family passing
        * “You want to have your affairs in order, because you don’t want to leave anybody with a mess, because trying to make a decision during the grieving process is almost impossible.”
        * Want to make things easier for family

__Pre-need burial benefit__



* Not familiar with it
    * “Not as worded, no”
        * Once I explained, it made sense to her
    * She would just look up burial benefits, wouldn't think of looking up “pre-need”
    * “Veteran burial benefits” would cover it - “the less words the better”
        * Assumes if she wanted something like this benefit, it would be under Veteran Burial Benefits
    * Would like to know who to contact because most people will need help coordinating that
* After a decision is reached, she’d need to know a step by step what to do, direction and guidance
* Letter mailed typically
    * Would add copy to trust
    * Would make copies and send to everyone who may be working on her affairs
    * VA should be informative
        * How many cemeteries are there?
        * Their job is to give you all the information
        * Not really needed to step in unless there’s a widow that needs assistance
            * Would like someone who has no help to be able to contact the VA for assistance
            * Send someone to their local VA, someone they can have a face-to-face conversation
            * Not everyone is going to be computer literate, and be able to get to or navigate the website
        * Share all information to assist Veterans
        * They can share all the information, but some won’t read. We can’t hold everyone’s hand. You have to draw the line somewhere.

__Preparing for your own burial on VA.gov (burial benefits section)__



* Info looks sufficient (looking at 4 main categories, pre-need being one of them)
* Info she wants to see
    * Can people get new uniforms or dress blues if they no longer have theirs?
        * It’s a source of pride for a Veteran
        * Sometimes they’re moth eaten and you don’t want to be buried in that
    * What costs are covered?
        * Does it cover a hearse? Do they pick you up?
        * Well, you know, they charge you to dig the hole. They open the grave. They charge you to uncover it. They charge you to lower you down. They charge you to cover it back up.
        * Does the government cover lawn maintenance?

__Pre-need information on VA site__



* Found info easily under “Get Veterans burial benefits”
* “Do I really need to go through that step to find out if I’m qualified?”
    * I have a DD214
    * Would go to eligibility
    * Would assume she wouldn’t have to go through this step
* (after reading through pre-need info) This is making me think that everyone needs a pre-need letter - and should be put in place before you pass away
* Confusing wording
    * A Veteran who didn’t receive a dishonorable discharge.. That’s kind of double talk
    * Why can’t they just say if you received dishonorable discharge, you’re not qualified?
    * (Looks at her DD214 off camera)
        * “Where does it say I was a good girl for 6 years”
        * Would rather have the same wording as on the DD214: something like “Veteran whose character of service was honorable, is eligible.”
* Well, actually, now that we're looking at this, I did not realize that this is something that I probably need to handle beforehand.
    * (reading more) it says you'll need to contact the cemetery about their pre-need program.
* “Um… I love this. We don't take reservations at the VA National Cemetery. Well, damn. Y’all said you did.” 
* Not everyone has their DD214
    * Knows of instances where people have difficulties getting it (e.g. accessing a parent’s form for the other parent to be admitted into a nursing home)
    * Likes that site has info on requesting a DD214
* There’s some forms to download that say you have the right to make decisions on behalf of the Veteran
* Wants info on getting help to be at the top
        * “But there are a lot of words on here. And if you're scrolling down here through here, I mean, I've tapped my screen, what, 7, 8, 9, 10 times before I get to get help. And that should be the very first thing they offer you. The very first thing they offer you is get help filling out these applications.”
* Would want to fill it out online, on a desktop
    * Chooses desktop over phone as she wants to be able to save documents to her computer (difficult to find things if she saves them on her phone). Would create a folder and save screenshots there.
    * Still would print everything out even if it can be submitted online. Concerned about losing things if her computer crashes.
        * “If my house burns down, I lose my papers too.”
    * Her father and husband would have trouble filling out form on the phone.
        * Father has no fingerprints from chemotherapy.
        * Husband doesn’t have much feeling in fingertips, hard time navigating face of phone.
* Sees there’s lots of forms if you’re filling out for someone else
    * My dad doesn’t have an email address - how might he fill these out?

__Has filled out plenty of forms for travel + forms for Medicare filing__



* Has a printer, scanner fax machine - uploading documents is not a problem
* Has uploaded documents from phone before - looks very easy to do on pre-need application

__Pre-need application prototype__



* Is it going to allow me to pick where I stored it on my phone? Would it have a search feature?
* Has taken pictures of documents on phone
* Had a lot of things sent to the cloud and I don’t really pull anything back from the cloud

__Upon reaching “You’ve submitted your application”__



* Would be nice to get a response back that they received it, and if they need more information
* Wants to let them know how she’d like to be contacted
* Likes the idea of having status updates within her account - wouldn’t have to go back and forth looking for things

__Would like to set contact preferences for many things__



* So many people aren’t capable of doing business on the phone
    * Father can’t hear, so it’s sometimes her number that is used
* Wants to label what the phone number is that’s being entered (e.g. “this is my daughter’s number”) - also wants to mark the preferred phone number
    * Father wouldn’t check text/emails

__Decision letter / notification__



* Would like to have it on myVA/the app
* If it’s done, it should be easy to find

* Has tried to discuss burial plans with his wife, but she is reluctant to talk about it
    * Trying to convince her that he needs to take care of things now, since when he dies if she’s still alive she may not know the proper paperwork

* Prefers minimal paperwork and hopes to avoid submitting numerous documents
* Skimmed through the page and found the information easy to understand

    * It’s one thing to keep track of your own important forms (e.g. birth certificate and DD214) but it’s another to keep track of other people’s forms. He wants there to be a government tracker where the pre-need letter could be found by others. Hates when there’s only one copy of a letter and you need to beg for another copy of the letter.
    * If he has a letter, first thing he’ll do is scan it so he has a copy with other official documentation.

__After application is submitted__



* Wants clear timelines for processing after submitting applications
