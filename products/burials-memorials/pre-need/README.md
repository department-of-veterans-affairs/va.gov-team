# Executive Summary

## User Problem Statement
Veterans (and their loved ones) want to choose which VA cemetary they'd like to be buried preemptively, but currently they need to submit a paper form in order to receive this benefit; as a result Veterans have a difficult time applying to determine their preneed eligibility.

### User Goals
- Quickly submit a preneed eligibilty application as a veteran, dependent, or on behalf of a Veteran
- Received an eligibility determiniation within 45 days.

### Business Goals
- Transform the preneed application intake process from paper to digital
- Reduce the amount of time NCA staff has to spend following up with Veterans to correct errors that occur from paper submission

## Assumptions
- NCA/EOAS has the capacity to process the new applications that will be coming from vets.gov (they currently have a 35,000 application backlog as of 8/9/18)

## Requirements and Constraints
- The EOAS backend service takes over a month to get a change into Production. Enhancements must be addressed with this in mind.

## Solution Approach
- Focus the first iteration of the preneed application on enable logged in and logged out users to submit a singular user submission. *Note in [Solution Narrative](#solution-narrative) section that they were interested in submissions containing multiple applicants*

## Value Propositions
- Reduces the burden of applying for preneed applications by enabling a digital submission
- Reduces the burden of processing preneed applications by avoiding manual transfer from paper to EOAS backend
- Ultimately reduces the time it takes for users to get their preneed eligibility determination

## KPIs
- Increase the number of digital Preneed Submissions
- Reduce the number of paper Preneed Submissions

# Implementation Info

## Status
- The application is live in production https://www.vets.gov/burials-and-memorials/pre-need/form-10007-apply-for-eligibility/introduction

## Solution Narrative
- This feature was originally scoped to allow multiple people to file applications in one submission (primary use case: a Veteran and their spouse both applying to determine their eligibility). Due to complications with handling form and file submission failures, the MVP has been re-scoped to a single applicant. The resources below all point to the original intent of multi-applicant submission.
