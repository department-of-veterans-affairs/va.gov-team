[Criteria Issue](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/323) 

## Summary

High level questions this research was trying to answer:

- What's working well for users and what are the pain points they're experiencing when applying for pre-need eligibility determination?
- Why are most users applying through desktop devices, and how can we improve rates for mobile applications and successful submissions overall?
- Since the majority of users are in the upper age brackets (35+ years old), what enhancements can we make to improve the application process for them?
- Which areas of the pre-need application are potentially confusing for users, particularly in determining whose details they need to enter throughout the form?
- Do they understand the difference between an Applicant, a Sponsor, a Previous Decedent, and a Preparer, and is it simple for them to determine in which sections of the form they need to provide these details?
- Do they understand which option to select for the applicant's relationship to the service or Veteran (I am the service member or Veteran, Spouse or surviving spouse, Unmarried adult child, Other)?
- Which areas of the form, if any, do users find particularly sensitive?
- Does the pre-need form content need user needs in this particularly sensitive application process? If not, how can it be improved to address user needs?
