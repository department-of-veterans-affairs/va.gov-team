# Conversation Guide: Pre-Need Eligibility Determination Application (VA Form 40-10007), Usability Research of Pre-Integration Enhancements, June 2023

## Moderator logistics

- _Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers._ [In this study, we will be using the designated Teams channel to facilitate communications with stakeholders.]
- _Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel))._
- _Mute your Slack and computer notifications._

### Before you start the session
- _Make sure everyone except the participant and moderator are on mute._
- _In the Participant window, tap the More drop-down arrow and make sure "Play join and leave sound" is unchecked._
- _Check your [screensharing setup]. Make sure you are setup on Zoom app and ready to screenshare in case participant can't._
- _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

## Project-Specific Setup and Intro - 10 minutes

- _[Moderator turns on camera. Waits to admit observers until consent is received from participant]_ 
- Thanks for joining us today! My name is [moderator name] and I'm a designer for VA.gov. I also have a colleague on the line, [Charlie or Cindy], observing and taking notes. Today, we're going to review a prototype of the VA Pre-Need application for eligibility determination at a VA national cemetery. We're working on improvements to the form, so it's important that we get feedback from users.
- This entire session should take about 45 minutes or less. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question.
- You'll be taking a look at a prototype of the application. This prototype is basically made up of images or mockups so none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits and none of your details are collected at any point or associated to your comments. As you click through the prototype, the fields will prefill with test data. 
- If, for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow other observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - _**If no:** Use Slack/Teams to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom._
   - _**If yes:** Admit observers._ 
    - _Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)_
   - _Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth. Moderator can turn off camera._

- Are you on a desktop, mobile or tablet device?

- I'm going to send you a link in the chat that I would like for you to open.

[Pre-Integration v0.1 Invasion Prototype UT Link](https://bahdigital.invisionapp.com/console/share/HF26GKB9W7Q)

- Okay, now I'm going to ask you to share your screen in Zoom so that we can look at the prototype together and then we'll begin.
- **Zoom screensharing on desktop:** Locate green Share Screen button on the bottom tool pane.
- **Zoom screensharing on mobile:** Locate Share button in bottom tool panel (it's scrollable and they may need to scroll to see button if off screen), then hit "Start broadcast".

**If they have trouble locating the chat or with sharing, talk them through finding the chat window to locate the prototype link and the Zoom screen sharing features.** [Zoom share screen directions](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen-or-desktop-on-Zoom)

_Can actually do this while explaining to them where to find “Chat” and “Share,” so by the end we're looking at their screen, then move onto recording._


**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You can tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

////// **Recording Instructions** //////

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? Yes
    - **If yes:** Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more: Yes. 

*If yes, start recording to the Cloud.*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?" Yes

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
- To start, I'd like to ask you a few warm-up questions.
- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?  My names David, Marine Corps Veteran, infantry man, 40-year-old disabled veteran. That’s good. 
- Did you know that you could apply to see if you're eligible to be buried in a national cemetery at any time? I was not aware of that. 
- What do you think qualifies you to be buried in a national cemetery? Having served in the Armed Forces. 
- When thinking about planning for your burial, would you prefer to be buried in a national cemetery? Uh I honestly hadn’t thought about it before. 
- Have you applied before to see if you're eligible for burial in a national cemetery? No I have not. 
    - If No: Is that something you would be interested in doing at some point? Yeah. 

## Getting Started - 1 minute

- When applying to see if you're eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery, the VA Pre-Need application can be used. I'm going to give you a scenario for you to walk through a prototype of this application and give us your thoughts.
- The prototype link I shared is a work in progress, so there might be a few mistakes, or it may not function exactly the way you expect, which is ok. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not, and some fields will fill in when you click on them.
- While you're going through the scenario, it would be really helpful if you'd think aloud - kind of like you'd do if you were talking to yourself. We are interested in your first reactions, what you're thinking & wondering as you go through the process. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn, so we want to hear your honest opinions. We're not testing your ability. We just want to improve the form to better meet Veteran's needs. We won't be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your feedback.
- When you think aloud, it helps us understand what works well and where we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free to ask them along the way. 

[Note:  Each participant will go through **ONE** of the tasks below.]

## Task 1: Applying for Self - Applicant is Veteran - 15 minutes

Ok, in the prototype we're looking at the start of the Pre-Need application. 
- **Scenario:** For your scenario, pretend that you are Sammy Smith, a Navy Veteran, and that you want to plan for the future and find out if you're eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery. How would you go about filling out this application? I am scrolling through reading the requirements. I don’t know why it pulled that up, it was a little strange to me. When I scroll it keeps pulling this tab up then puts me at the top. I am trying to scroll to read but this keeps coming up , I assume it is the preneed I would qualify under. I was able to scroll to the bottom this time. 
-  Would you value this on the landing page: the initial page is good letting you know what the criteria is to see if you are eligible. Scrolling through it says some ways that you’d be eligible that I hadn’t thought of. Being a veteran myself knowing that a depending or widow would be able to apply was not something I would know. That is good information that can be passed on to family members. 
- I am looking for something to start the application. I see what happens after. It’s not all the way at the bottom it is more like 3/4th way down. 
- Starting the application process. Reading through. I am seeing the status; it is applying to me. 
Is the wording you can understand: Yah, even at first glance it is apparent what it is asking form. I am skimming the top steps because seeing the bullet points it is apparent to me who is applying at this stage. 
- It seems like the standard form to fill out. It seems sensitive going back and forth. It keeps clicking to what if the applicant is not a service member or veteran. 
-   It all seems pretty standard. Do you need me to fill it out. When I try to click on the maiden name it is highlighting different places. When I click place of birth it filled in San Diego. It is only letting me select female, it wont let me pick male. 
    - What are your thoughts regarding the messaging for potentially sensitive questions? 
    - What are your thoughts on the questions themselves? I don’t mind the question, but  I don’t understand the purpose. Is it to get data for who is using the survey. I don’t see how it is relevant for the pre—need burial. The questions are fine and I understand them but I wont understand what it is being collected for. It sats for statistical purposed but it doesn’t seem relevant. Why do you need to know who is using it in depth. 
- **Military history - Military details**
- pretty standard asking for the military number or social. 
- current military status makes sense, it is worded well, and I understand what it is asking. 
- **Military history - Service periods**
    - asking who you serviced with, branch, when you started, when you ended, rank. The character of service is a little weird to me. Once you click on it, it is obvious it is for the discharge character. 
Are you prepared to answer these questions, or would you need to look them up? Based off of my personal history I would know how to answer it because I have filled it out so many times applying for va claims previously. Me I know I started September 2nd, 2002, and ended December 17, 2008. 
    - What would you do if you didn't have this information on hand? I would look for a copy of my dd214 if I still had it, if not I remember how hard it was remember getting the information and updated copies. I would use google how to find it which lead me to the proper websites which was va.gov . also where to find my service letters, I can’t remember where I went to get an updated copy of my dd214, but I know I used google to get this type of information. 
- I understand the served under another name. 

- asking which cemetery we want to be buried in I assume the map will bring up all eligible cemeteries. I don’t know them off the top of my head. I would still look it up to see if it is near my family and where I am currently living. I don’t know if it is possible to add a link to a google maps or waze or map program to pull it up to see how far away it is. That would be useful information. That is something I would go outside of this to  look up so I know where it is at incase my family wants to visit. Reading the note it says it is a selection and not garmented to get it. So where it says after the note will assign a gravesite at time of need. I don’t know if it’s possible to list a top three in case the first one was denied. How it sounds if there isn’t room in your choice you may be placed in another that is not feasible for family to visit. I understand what this is asking like if your spouse is burial there using your eligibility. 
- if you answer yes who it is and where they are at. It is easy to understand, and you should know where they are at
-  How do you feel about the wording of the fields: Neutral I guess. I think it is asking for their name. I don’t think it is inappropriate. I cant think of a better way to word it. So I guess I am neutral . I don’t think its inopportune the way its worded. 
- **Supporting docs** 
    - That is pretty good wording, the dropdown menus telling you what type of documents to upload. The address under mail and the contact information is very useful because that information is hard to find sometimes so having it there is helpful. 
- Do you think you would need to upload something here to continue? I mean I would feel fine with using it. This is part of the VA I guess. Different departments have different information in the system  but it’s not like they cant get access. They need it in order to make their determination if it is eligible. I would look at it as a required document that you have to upload. 
    - How would you go about uploading this if you're on a mobile device? I have a background in cyber security so I would not. I also probably wouldn’t be doing this on a mobile device, I would use a desktop computer because I find that it is easier for me. I try not to put anything on my phone that has sensitive information. 
-  PDF or more options: I would expect it to be a PDF, but I could understand how they may want a jpg form. Some people may not know that you can use a free PDF program and that there are plenty that are trustworthy to use. For me from a personal aspect I would be fine with a PDF. 
- Contact information is pretty standard, and you should be able to fill everything out. Phone numbers and email is pretty standard I think. I would expect to fill this out when applying to give them a way to contact you in regard to if you are accepted or denied. I would expect this to be required. 
- Review page: being able to pull it up and see all of the answers you can go through to see if there are errors. The edit button is there so you can change it right there. I like that ability. Contact information making sure there’s no typos, that’s why I prefer a computer because I can type better on a keyboard rather than a mobile device. Than of course you have the privacy policy to read and see that no one actually reads. Then submit the application. They always say please print this. I don’t know if it could be emailed to you, which is much easier in my opinion. I know from personal experience when you have this up I will forget to print it so having a copy emailed as well would be a huge help. I love places that do that. It has the information if you need to send more documents. I don’t see a place to go back to edit to add more. From this it leads me to believe you cannot go back to upload more. 
- **Confirmation** 
    - When do you think you would get a decision? Sometime in the next year. I am not sure how quickly the decisions are reached. It says at the start that they received a ton of applications, so it is taking longer than normal. Dealing with the va for claims they all stay that so I think it may be standard language now. I would not be expecting a decision anytime soon I guess. 


## Post-Task Interview - 5-10 minutes
- What did you think of the application process overall? Pretty straight forward, nothing out of the bounds or that I wouldn’t expect. The only thing I didn’t know why you were asking was the sex at birth and ethnicity. I don’t understand the relevance for that. 
- On a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest, how would you rate the application process for Pre-Need that you just experienced? A 4.5 it is pretty easy and straightforward. 
- On a scale of 1 to 5, how mobile-friendly do you think it is? In the current state maybe a 3 because of the data and the working through problems swiping through. That would be a little frustrating if it constantly did it
-  What about without swiping: I would say a 3.5 or 4 because of some of the documentation it is asking. I have it pre-saved on my desktop, so it is easier to do this on my desktop because I already have it in a folder. Whereas if I do it from my mobile device I have to email it to me to download then upload again. It adds extra steps.
- If you could snap your fingers and recreate the application process for pre-need to make it better, what would that process look like? It is all pretty straightforward. I don’t know if there is a way that it can prepull my dd214 or other documents needed form the website that way you don’t need to upload anything. May there could be errors with it pulling the wrong stuff. I cant think how to make it better without knowing what data it has access to on the back end. 
- I'm going to ask my colleagues [Charlie or Cindy] if they have questions at this time **Only if there are observers:** and also check the channel to see if any of our observers have any questions. 
- Character of service field was strange for the field, suggestions for wording: Its not so much that it wasn’t worded appropriately I wasn’t sure what it was asking at first. All others were obvious but once you clicked on the dropdown it let me know the charter of discharge. Even saying type of discharge would all be more obvious at a glance. Once you click on the dropdown with the options it obvious but at the first glance I want sure what it was asking for. 
- Do you have any questions for me? 

## Thank You and Closing - 2 minutes

- Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the VA.gov Pre-Need application to make sure that it really works for Veterans.
- Thanks so much! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
- Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!

**STOP RECORDING** 

- **Ask observers for top takeaways after participant has dropped**

## Emergency Exit

> [In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it’s easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable
