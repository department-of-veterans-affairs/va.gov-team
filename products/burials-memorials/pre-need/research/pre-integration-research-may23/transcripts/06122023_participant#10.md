# Conversation Guide: Pre-Need Eligibility Determination Application (VA Form 40-10007), Usability Research of Pre-Integration Enhancements, June 2023

## Moderator logistics

- _Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers._ [In this study, we will be using the designated Teams channel to facilitate communications with stakeholders.]
- _Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel))._
- _Mute your Slack and computer notifications._

### Before you start the session
- _Make sure everyone except the participant and moderator are on mute._
- _In the Participant window, tap the More drop-down arrow and make sure "Play join and leave sound" is unchecked._
- _Check your [screensharing setup]. Make sure you are setup on Zoom app and ready to screenshare in case participant can't._
- _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

## Project-Specific Setup and Intro - 10 minutes

- _[Moderator turns on camera. Waits to admit observers until consent is received from participant]_ 
- Thanks for joining us today! My name is [moderator name] and I'm a designer for VA.gov. I also have a colleague on the line, [Charlie or Cindy], observing and taking notes. Today, we're going to review a prototype of the VA Pre-Need application for eligibility determination at a VA national cemetery. We're working on improvements to the form, so it's important that we get feedback from users.
- This entire session should take about 45 minutes or less. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question.
- You'll be taking a look at a prototype of the application. This prototype is basically made up of images or mockups so none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits and none of your details are collected at any point or associated to your comments. As you click through the prototype, the fields will prefill with test data. 
- If, for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow other observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - _**If no:** Use Slack/Teams to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom._
   - _**If yes:** Admit observers._ 
    - _Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)_
   - _Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth. Moderator can turn off camera._

- Are you on a desktop, mobile or tablet device?

- I'm going to send you a link in the chat that I would like for you to open.

- Okay, now I'm going to ask you to share your screen in Zoom so that we can look at the prototype together and then we'll begin.
- **Zoom screensharing on desktop:** Locate green Share Screen button on the bottom tool pane.
- **Zoom screensharing on mobile:** Locate Share button in bottom tool panel (it's scrollable and they may need to scroll to see button if off screen), then hit "Start broadcast".

**If they have trouble locating the chat or with sharing, talk them through finding the chat window to locate the prototype link and the Zoom screen sharing features.** [Zoom share screen directions](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen-or-desktop-on-Zoom)

_Can actually do this while explaining to them where to find “Chat” and “Share,” so by the end we're looking at their screen, then move onto recording._


**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You can tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

////// **Recording Instructions** //////

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - **If yes:** Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more. 
    - **If no:** That's ok. We can use our notes to complete our analysis.

*If yes, start recording to the Cloud.*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?" Yes I am comfortable thank you. 
- Ok. Now we're really ready to begin!

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
- To start, I'd like to ask you a few warm-up questions.
- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? Ys, I was in the military in the mid-80s to 1990’s. I actually for the cold war was a cryptography decoding and coding messages. I did that for 6 years then went reserves. Right now I am retired and actually working for the national guard as a counselor. 
- Did you know that you could apply to see if you're eligible to be buried in a national cemetery at any time? I have not checked to see that, but I know just from my dad’s service he was able to get buried through the service. 
- What do you think qualifies you to be buried in a national cemetery? Just good service and honorable discharge. I guess time in and all of that has to do with being able to be buried. 
- When thinking about planning for your burial, would you prefer to be buried in a national cemetery? To tell you the truthy years ago I explored being buried in a tree pod and that’s the only other thing I though of. I don’t mind either was if it was a VA cemetery it would be an honor to tell you the truthy. 
- Have you applied before to see if you're eligible for burial in a national cemetery? That’s correct. 
    - If No: Is that something you would be interested in doing at some point? Oh definitely 

## Getting Started - 1 minute

- When applying to see if you're eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery, the VA Pre-Need application can be used. I'm going to give you a scenario for you to walk through a prototype of this application and give us your thoughts.
- The prototype link I shared is a work in progress, so there might be a few mistakes, or it may not function exactly the way you expect, which is ok. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not, and some fields will fill in when you click on them.
- While you're going through the scenario, it would be really helpful if you'd think aloud - kind of like you'd do if you were talking to yourself. We are interested in your first reactions, what you're thinking & wondering as you go through the process. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn, so we want to hear your honest opinions. We're not testing your ability. We just want to improve the form to better meet Veteran's needs. We won't be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your feedback.
- When you think aloud, it helps us understand what works well and where we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free to ask them along the way. 

[Note:  Each participant will go through **ONE** of the tasks below.]


## Task 2: Applying for Self - Applicant is non-Veteran - 15 minutes

Ok, in the prototype we're looking at the start of the Pre-Need application. 
- **Scenario:** For your scenario, pretend that you are Sammy Smith. You are married to a service member. You want to plan for the future and apply for yourself to see if you're eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery. Your spouse is sponsoring your benefits. How would you go about filling out this application for yourself? This is really straightforward actually. It breaks it down nicely. I wonder why it doesn’t apply to Arlington National cemetery. Okay. I clicked the green button how it says start the pre-need edibility application so I would click on that. 
Questions about this page: no we can get started. 

### Questions to ask as they go through scenario
- **Introduction**
    - What are your thoughts regarding the content on this page?
    - Do you feel prepared to start applying?
- **Applicant information - Applicant relationship to service member / Veteran**
   -  I am applying for myself. So spouse or surviving spouse right. 
 - Do you understand how to answer the question this screen is asking? 
- **Sponsor information - Sponsor details**
  - Who’s details would you be adding: it looks like it is my information, but I am sure they’ll ask for the spousing information after this. 
  - What are your thoughts regarding whose details you'll need to provide here? 
- **Sponsor information - Sponsor demographics**
  - So now it would say my husband
Familiar with that term: yes because I helped spouses get Tricare. 
Commonly used in the military: it depends I  know it is common for any VA benefits and Tricare. Anything like that they use the word sponsor a lot. 
- Oh it says female. 
  - What do you think about the messaging for potentially sensitive questions? The very top that says talk to the veteran’s crisis line. Oh here. That’s good it just tells you that you might be filling in personal or sensitive information, I would think that you would know that going into any type of application. It is self-explanatory, everything. 
    - What are your thoughts on the questions themselves? 
- **Sponsor information - Sponsor's passing **
- there we go. 
    - What do you think about the messaging for potentially sensitive questions here?
    - Is anything confusing or concerning to you?
    - Why do you think this information is collected?
- **Military history - Sponsor's military details**
   - _Keep an eye out for confusion regarding status dropdown options_ 
- **Military history - Sponsor's service periods**
    - Are you prepared to answer these questions, or would you need to look them up?  Yeah if you are married to someone hopefully you would know their service number I would assume. Some people aren’t organized or have paperwork, but I am sure it would be easy to get these numbers if you don’t have them. 
- Okay. 
Prepared or need to look it up: Especially with the service dates I think I would know the highest rank. Then the service dates I may need to look up to get the exact dates. 
-  Required verse not required: Um all of them. 
-  Try to answer all: Yes. The more information they have the easier it will go. 
- Character of service question clear: Yes. It is very clear. 
- Served under another name, I hope not. Sponsor that’s my name.
You think you need your information: no but it has Sammy as previous first name. I guess that’s if they had their maiden name before getting married. 
    - What would you do if you didn't have this information on hand?
- **Burial benefits - Previous decedents**
 -  I didn’t know that you get to pick. 
Process: I just didn’t think you got to pick; I thought if you were applying they would burial you as close as they could to your family. I didn’t know you got to pick a cemetery. Of course they cannot guarantee it.  That is kind of nice that you kind of get to pick. 
   - What are your thoughts regarding the questions on the page? I think that is great. You know it would be an honor to be buried in a national cemetery so if you got to put your preferences in there that would be awesome. 
- **Supporting docs** 
 -  Okay. Dd214. Upload file. 
   - Do you think you would need to upload something here to continue? I would think that certain things would be required like your dd214 so they can see the time and the status on my last dd214. Then probably they would need marriage documents to prove you were actually married and the sponsor has the right to make sure you have a burial plot as well. 
    - How would you go about uploading this if you're on a mobile device? Well Um on here it says upload files after you pick, in my mobile I have stuff like the one drive and things like that that I can pull it off the drive or PDF for Adobe. So I can pull it off of that. Personally, I have a lot of documents on my phone in case I need to pull up anything. Pretty much a lot of legal stuff is on my OneDrive. 
Desktop to, preference: To tell you the truth my mobile is my preferred due to the convenience. I have access to my mobile all the time. Let’s say I am sitting somewhere and want to finish this process; I wouldn’t have my computer, but I would have my mobile. 
    - What are your thoughts regarding the allowed file types [PDFs]? Well it says what kind of document can I upload. It does say (Reading page). Okay. Then can I mail or fax documents. Yes I would try to do it via the computer. 
Only PDF, would you be able to do that: yes. You can change a document to a PDF really easily, it’s no big deal. 
- **Contact information - Sponsor address/contact details** 
 - It is kind of nice you have the application ID on each page in case you left a few screens ago. Okay. Well this is nice it has questions that you are able to expand like why do we need your contact details. This is really good. 
   - Would you have this on hand, or would you need to look it up?
- **Confirmation** 
Review: This is nice you can check each section to make sure you filled it out correctly and review the answers. Okay. It says is anyone buried. I don’t know who that would be. Okay. I hope it’s not this sensitive when it comes to the real deal. Okay. I would submit. 
    - What would you do at this point? Um if I got finished with the application. I would just, it looks like I had all of my documents needed basically so I would check my email to make sure there was a confirmation there then wait for them to contact me if they need more information. I would assume it would take a while. 
    - When do you think you would get a decision? I think I would say months. I guess when I was applying for my last dd214 it took 7 months for me to get it so I am suing my experience to say it may take months. The VA takes a long time with stuff, but I know they have a lot of people they are serving. 

## Post-Task Interview - 5-10 minutes
Wonderful! Thank you so much for walking through that with us and telling us your thoughts. We just have a few questions to ask before we wrap up our session for today. 
- What did you think of the application process overall? Um I thought it was a piece of cake actually. It was really easy, super easy to figure out what you needed to fill in or why you needed that. It was all pretty self-explanatory. The actual small questions asking it was easy to fill in you know. Instead of filling it out and not being able to ask questions. 
- On a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest, how would you rate the application process for Pre-Need that you just experienced? Um I would say it’s a 5, it’s super easy. 
- On a scale of 1 to 5, how mobile-friendly do you think it is? Um I would say it’s a 4 or 5 you know. Obviously, the sensitivity will go away so a 5. 
- If you could snap your fingers and recreate the application process for pre-need to make it better, what would that process look like? I really don’t actually. It’s easy and obviously I like easy. It gives me hope that the entire thing will be easy and quick. This wouldn’t have taken much time; it would have taken more time to get the documents unless you are organized. It shouldn’t take very long for anyone to fill this out. 
- Is there anything else on your mind that we didn't ask? No. 
- I'm going to ask my colleagues [Charlie or Cindy] if they have questions at this time **Only if there are observers:** and also check the channel to see if any of our observers have any questions. [Check Teams chat for questions]
- You mention previously on the military history page the more information provided the quicker the process: Yeah I don’t mine I just think if you provide the information such as everything on the application and able to upload the forms right there then you wouldn’t need to go back and fourth with the va needing a form then needing to mail it in. then it takes forever when mailed in. the more you can enter and the copies of the paperwork you need, if they are added right away they won’t go back and fourth for what’s needed. It’s already done. 
- Do you have any questions for me? I really don’t. 

## Thank You and Closing - 2 minutes

- Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the VA.gov Pre-Need application to make sure that it really works for Veterans.
- Thanks so much! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
- Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!

**STOP RECORDING** 

- **Ask observers for top takeaways after participant has dropped**

## Emergency Exit

> [In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it’s easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
