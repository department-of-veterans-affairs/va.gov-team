# Conversation Guide: Pre-Need Eligibility Determination Application (VA Form 40-10007), Usability Research of Pre-Integration Enhancements, June 2023

## Moderator logistics

- _Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers._ [In this study, we will be using the designated Teams channel to facilitate communications with stakeholders.]
- _Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel))._
- _Mute your Slack and computer notifications._

### Before you start the session
- _Make sure everyone except the participant and moderator are on mute._
- _In the Participant window, tap the More drop-down arrow and make sure "Play join and leave sound" is unchecked._
- _Check your [screensharing setup]. Make sure you are setup on Zoom app and ready to screenshare in case participant can't._
- _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

## Project-Specific Setup and Intro - 10 minutes

- _[Moderator turns on camera. Waits to admit observers until consent is received from participant]_ 
- Thanks for joining us today! My name is [moderator name] and I'm a designer for VA.gov. I also have a colleague on the line, [Charlie or Cindy], observing and taking notes. Today, we're going to review a prototype of the VA Pre-Need application for eligibility determination at a VA national cemetery. We're working on improvements to the form, so it's important that we get feedback from users.
- This entire session should take about 45 minutes or less. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question.
- You'll be taking a look at a prototype of the application. This prototype is basically made up of images or mockups so none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits and none of your details are collected at any point or associated to your comments. As you click through the prototype, the fields will prefill with test data. 
- If, for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow other observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - _**If no:** Use Slack/Teams to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom._
   - _**If yes:** Admit observers._ 
    - _Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)_
   - _Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth. Moderator can turn off camera._

- Are you on a desktop, mobile or tablet device?

- I'm going to send you a link in the chat that I would like for you to open.

- Okay, now I'm going to ask you to share your screen in Zoom so that we can look at the prototype together and then we'll begin.
- **Zoom screensharing on desktop:** Locate green Share Screen button on the bottom tool pane.
- **Zoom screensharing on mobile:** Locate Share button in bottom tool panel (it's scrollable and they may need to scroll to see button if off screen), then hit "Start broadcast".

**If they have trouble locating the chat or with sharing, talk them through finding the chat window to locate the prototype link and the Zoom screen sharing features.** [Zoom share screen directions](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen-or-desktop-on-Zoom)

_Can actually do this while explaining to them where to find “Chat” and “Share,” so by the end we're looking at their screen, then move onto recording._


**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You can tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?" Yes I am. 
- Ok. Now we're really ready to begin!

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
- To start, I'd like to ask you a few warm-up questions.
- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?  A little bit about myself wow, how much do you want to know. I spent 6 years  in active duty for the navy from 86 to 93. I went through the nuclear program and was abased out of Peral harbor. I was on the submarine for 3 years. 1.5 years of school prior to that then I had 2 years inactive after active-duty discharge. That’s it as far as military service. 
- Did you know that you could apply to see if you're eligible to be buried in a national cemetery at any time? Yes but how do I get into Albrighton because I don’t have a medal of honor.  Interaction with veterans and involvement with the va that included information about burial benefits and my grandfather is in the black hill’s cemetery. I guess that was my first window to viability with hose benefits. 
- What do you think qualifies you to be buried in a national cemetery?  Um, a veteran with an honorable or general discharge and veterans sated of 180 days active duty. 
- When thinking about planning for your burial, would you prefer to be buried in a national cemetery? More than likely a veteran national cemetery or spread my ashes where my grandfather is in black hiss or in HI off of Diamond head. Punachables is there as well. It is in HI. 
- Have you applied before to see if you're eligible for burial in a national cemetery? Define preneed. Oh it’s right there in front of me. No I have not from what I know of. 

## Getting Started - 1 minute

- When applying to see if you're eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery, the VA Pre-Need application can be used. I'm going to give you a scenario for you to walk through a prototype of this application and give us your thoughts.
- The prototype link I shared is a work in progress, so there might be a few mistakes, or it may not function exactly the way you expect, which is ok. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not, and some fields will fill in when you click on them.
- While you're going through the scenario, it would be really helpful if you'd think aloud - kind of like you'd do if you were talking to yourself. We are interested in your first reactions, what you're thinking & wondering as you go through the process. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn, so we want to hear your honest opinions. We're not testing your ability. We just want to improve the form to better meet Veteran's needs. We won't be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your feedback.
- When you think aloud, it helps us understand what works well and where we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free to ask them along the way. 

[Note:  Each participant will go through **ONE** of the tasks below.]

## Task 3: Applying for Someone Else - Applicant is non-Veteran - 20 minutes

Ok, in the prototype we're looking at the start of the Pre-Need application. 
- **Scenario:** For your scenario, pretend that you are Sammy Smith. You're a navy Veteran, and you have an unmarried adult child who is 20 years old. You want to plan for the future and find out if your adult child is eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery under your benefits. How would you go about filling out this application? (Reading page) All of these steps, find out if you are eligible. Spouse or dependent child. Service history. I can choose a cemetery unless it’s state or tribal. Doesn’t apply to Arlington. Doesn’t guarantee that I will be place in one, they don’t take reservations which seems kind of odd. One for me and my wife. They need the dd214. Then click here to apply. Well I would see if I have the supporting documents, it looks like I need to contact the doctor to verify. If I have all of those documents in hand I would start the application. (Reading page) Once I have it all I would go ahead and apply. 

### Questions to ask as they go through scenario
- **Introduction**
    - 
- What are your thoughts regarding the content on this page?
    - Do you feel prepared to start applying?
- **Applicant information - Applicant relationship to service member / Veteran**
    - Is the applicant the someone else or am I.  
- Do you understand how to answer the question this screen is asking? 
- **Sponsor information - Are you the sponsor? Y/N**
-  Familiar with the term sponsor: I assume it is the sponsor because it is under my military service, so I am sponsoring the disabled child. 
- what are you thinking: Why is this required. Why should my ethnicity have any basis for this. So do I need to guess on this or what. 
    - Would you have questions about what to select here? _[They should pick Yes based on the task]_
    - Whose details do you think you would need to provide if you picked No?  
- **Sponsor information - Sponsor details**
    - What are your thoughts regarding whose details you'll need to provide here? 
- **Sponsor information - Sponsor demographics**
    - What do you think about the messaging for potentially sensitive questions?
    - What are your thoughts on the questions themselves?
- **Military history - Sponsor's military details**
 - This are option, so I don’t know why it is requiring me to fill it. 
-  would you know where these numbers are or could get them: yes I know my service number was my social number. VA claim number, which claim. I have disability claims, is that what it referring to. 
   - _Keep an eye out for confusion regarding status dropdown options_ 
- **Military history - Sponsor's service periods**
    - What would you do if you didn't have this information on hand? Well that brings up other issues. You asked if I had access to my service records. I have had issues the last few years because I only have my last dd214, I requested my complete service record for the past 3 years and went through the national archives for that. 
- **Burial benefits - Previous decedents**
   - It lets me select this. These are my only options for the prototype. 
- **Supporting docs** 
- Do you think you would need to upload something here to continue?
    - How would you go about uploading this if you're on a mobile device?
    - What are your thoughts regarding the allowed file types [PDFs]?
- **Contact information - Sponsor address/contact details** 
     Would you have this on hand, or would you need to look it up?
- **Contact information - Preparer info/address/contact details** 
    -- Would you have this on hand, or would you need to look it up? It would be my information, Sammy’s. 
    - What are your thoughts on the information being prefilled here?
    - Do you understand the difference between a sponsor and a preparer?
- **Confirmation** 
- I am the sponsor. 
- you would click on that link: Yes
    - What would you do at this point? It would take me to a screen that would display the process that is subsequent to the application process. It would outline the process. 
    - When do you think you would get a decision? I don’t know, about 30 days. 

## Post-Task Interview - 5-10 minutes
Wonderful! Thank you so much for walking through that with us and telling us your thoughts. We just have a few questions to ask before we wrap up our session for today. 
- What did you think of the application process overall? I think it’s intuitive. I think it could be improved based on my comments, but I could have easily figured it out and submitted the application. It could be more intuitive. 
- On a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest, how would you rate the application process for Pre-Need that you just experienced?  4. 
- On a scale of 1 to 5, how mobile-friendly do you think it is?
- If you could snap your fingers and recreate the application process for pre-need to make it better, what would that process look like?  Not off the top of my head. Just based on the recordings you can see where I had questions, nothing that isn’t already on the recording. 
    - How would you do things differently?
- Is there anything else on your mind that we didn't ask?
- I'm going to ask my colleagues [Charlie or Cindy] if they have questions at this time **Only if there are observers:** and also check the channel to see if any of our observers have any questions. [Check Teams chat for questions]
- Require/non required field: Looking at the red asterisk, I wouldn’t fill it in if not required
Not required not as important: Others feel like they aren’t required that’s why they aren’t required. When you have dozens of emails you just have to do the bare minimum to get through it. 
- Do you have any questions for me? No, can I go through this now. 

## Thank You and Closing - 2 minutes

- Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the VA.gov Pre-Need application to make sure that it really works for Veterans.
- Thanks so much! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
- Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!

**STOP RECORDING** 

- **Ask observers for top takeaways after participant has dropped**

## Emergency Exit

> [In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it’s easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
