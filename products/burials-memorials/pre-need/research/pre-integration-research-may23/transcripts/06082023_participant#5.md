# Conversation Guide: Pre-Need Eligibility Determination Application (VA Form 40-10007), Usability Research of Pre-Integration Enhancements, June 2023

## Moderator logistics

- _Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers._ [In this study, we will be using the designated Teams channel to facilitate communications with stakeholders.]
- _Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel))._
- _Mute your Slack and computer notifications._

### Before you start the session
- _Make sure everyone except the participant and moderator are on mute._
- _In the Participant window, tap the More drop-down arrow and make sure "Play join and leave sound" is unchecked._
- _Check your [screensharing setup]. Make sure you are setup on Zoom app and ready to screenshare in case participant can't._
- _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

## Project-Specific Setup and Intro - 10 minutes

- _[Moderator turns on camera. Waits to admit observers until consent is received from participant]_ 
- Thanks for joining us today! My name is [moderator name] and I'm a designer for VA.gov. I also have a colleague on the line, [Charlie or Cindy], observing and taking notes. Today, we're going to review a prototype of the VA Pre-Need application for eligibility determination at a VA national cemetery. We're working on improvements to the form, so it's important that we get feedback from users.
- This entire session should take about 45 minutes or less. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question.
- You'll be taking a look at a prototype of the application. This prototype is basically made up of images or mockups so none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits and none of your details are collected at any point or associated to your comments. As you click through the prototype, the fields will prefill with test data. 
- If, for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow other observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - _**If no:** Use Slack/Teams to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom._
   - _**If yes:** Admit observers._ 
    - _Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)_
   - _Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth. Moderator can turn off camera._

- Are you on a desktop, mobile or tablet device?

- I'm going to send you a link in the chat that I would like for you to open.

[Pre-Integration v0.1 InVision Prototype UT Link](https://bahdigital.invisionapp.com/console/share/HF26GKB9W7Q)

- Okay, now I'm going to ask you to share your screen in Zoom so that we can look at the prototype together and then we'll begin.
- **Zoom screensharing on desktop:** Locate green Share Screen button on the bottom tool pane.
- **Zoom screensharing on mobile:** Locate Share button in bottom tool panel (it's scrollable and they may need to scroll to see button if off screen), then hit "Start broadcast".

**If they have trouble locating the chat or with sharing, talk them through finding the chat window to locate the prototype link and the Zoom screen sharing features.** [Zoom share screen directions](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen-or-desktop-on-Zoom)

_Can actually do this while explaining to them where to find “Chat” and “Share,” so by the end we're looking at their screen, then move onto recording._


**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You can tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

////// **Recording Instructions** //////

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? Yes, I am
    - **If yes:** Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more: Yes I am. 

*If yes, start recording to the Cloud.*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?"
- Ok. Now we're really ready to begin!

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
- To start, I'd like to ask you a few warm-up questions.
- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?  Air force vet, retired after 20 plus years. I guess single parent of elementary school children. Have physical and physiological challenges which keep me more focused on these sorts of things more than the average I would say. VA care, I don’t see much va medical besides for those issues. 
- Did you know that you could apply to see if you're eligible to be buried in a national cemetery at any time? Yeah I was aware of it. It was pretty good timing I got this study information because I just finished the process of applying and getting the confirmation a few  months ago. Someone else happened and it spurred the oh gee whizz. The less of a burden on the surviving spouse the better so it was unlocked in my mind. 
How did you learn it: It has been in the background of knowledge, but it was confirming it. Probably either va.gov or more likely the reddit veteran bases or the google machine so let’s say internet. 
      
- What do you think qualifies you to be buried in a national cemetery? If I remember correcting it is just honorable discharge. 
- When thinking about planning for your burial, would you prefer to be buried in a national cemetery? I don’t personally care much its about the surviving family. I would let them choose if it were free and different. I don’t give a woot anyways they could mulch me. 
- Have you applied before to see if you're eligible for burial in a national cemetery?  Yes the one time a few months ago. 
    - If Yes: Could you describe how that process went and your thoughts about it? I was actually surprised. Many things in va.gov are not as intuitive as I initially thought, or the process isn’t as smooth. This one wasn’t convoluted. It was are you eligible then apply and off it went. A month later I got a letter in the mail. This one compared to others was relativity easy. 
    - If No: Is that something you would be interested in doing at some point?

## Getting Started - 1 minute

- When applying to see if you're eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery, the VA Pre-Need application can be used. I'm going to give you a scenario for you to walk through a prototype of this application and give us your thoughts.
- The prototype link I shared is a work in progress, so there might be a few mistakes, or it may not function exactly the way you expect, which is ok. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not, and some fields will fill in when you click on them.
- While you're going through the scenario, it would be really helpful if you'd think aloud - kind of like you'd do if you were talking to yourself. We are interested in your first reactions, what you're thinking & wondering as you go through the process. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn, so we want to hear your honest opinions. We're not testing your ability. We just want to improve the form to better meet Veteran's needs. We won't be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your feedback.
- When you think aloud, it helps us understand what works well and where we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free to ask them along the way. 

[Note:  Each participant will go through **ONE** of the tasks below.]

## Task 3: Applying for Someone Else - Applicant is non-Veteran - 20 minutes

### Questions to ask as they go through scenario
Ok, in the prototype we're looking at the start of the Pre-Need application. 
- **Scenario:** For your scenario, pretend that you are Sammy Smith. You're a navy Veteran, and you have an unmarried adult child who is 20 years old. You want to plan for the future and find out if your adult child is eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery under your benefits. How would you go about filling out this application? Instead of clicking here I would just scroll because I am lazy. Oh lord this is going on forever so I will click and see if there’s a more obvious thing. Oh its not clickable. Alright (Reading page) I probably need more details or not. I would have clicked on that, but it all looks straight forward. I would move on to where and do the application. Yupp. Okay. Social security and DOB of my child then my dd214. It was super easy for me. Yupp. I guess I would be applying on behalf of someone else. There it is look at that. I meant to ask since I thought this would be a factor, do they have to be disabled. I guess I have to read it properly. I thought there had to be a reason why they still required your care, maybe I should stop scrolling so much and just read. That little bit there says it’s a requirement. That’s where I would have dug in further. It implies that as I expected. Let’s say I already know the location I want. 
- Last time you applied did you know which one: Yes, just the closest but I figured I would look and there was no surprises. It’s not about me it’s a guessing game of where my kids will be and maybe they wont care. 
- I am applying for someone else. I am applying for someone else. (Reading page) Gee, I would need to dig into that a lot  more. At this point I assume this issue, but I don’t know if there’s a mental disability. I don’t know. Why am I. Is Sammy Jr, mentally incompetent. Or is that for me to know. He is 20 and there’s not diagnosis or isn’t there. Where am I going for this? I would need to get the kid to sign it, it doesn’t say he cant sign it. I would sign it, done. 
- Uh no, yes. Love it fantastic. It’s nice that it will save it, I certainly appreciate that. I would screenshot that number quickly. Yupp that’s me. 
- Familiar with the Sponsor term: yes I am. 
- Nice, okay. Oh I am female I guess. I have no idea. I don’t remember which you said, I think I’m single
- Messaging at the top: I bet I didn’t even read it. Wait why do I need to answer this. I am going through automatically without reading. I don’t know why I need to give this; it doesn’t make sense. None of that seems to deal with what I am asking for. I don’t care personally but I don’t feel that it is called for asking for it. I don’t know why you would need any of that especially for the sponsor. That’s weird. 
- Now I will read things. That’s fair, I am retired or veteran you said. Thanks. Let’s say navy. Sweet.
- Service periods on hand: Oh I would just need to look at my binder. I know mine pretty well I think but I would check. That’s from doing so many forms but most folks may not have it handy or know. 
- If you didn’t have it what would you do: Probably do finish this application later like that. I don’t know what it’s doing. I guess it would work but it says each time you do an update it saves. I would go get them then come back. 
- Did I serve under another name, no because you didn’t say I did. That one fine. Do we care for this scenario. Most of my stuff is already electronically saved in my files
- What file format: PDF or JP. 
- On phone: on cloud files so I can pull it up on my phone. I have apple cloud and drobox depending on what it is. 
- Do you need to upload something here: yes. I would need the dd214, doctors’ letter, 
- At this point where would you find what documents you need: I am trying to remember. There’s nothing on this page so I am going off of member. It would be nice to have a check list of things here though, maybe that would come later. 
- He lives with me so the address will be the same. I assume you need it so you can tell me if there’s an issue or if I am confirmed. Super. please. Didn’t we just do that, no it is the application verse sponsor. Step 6 of 7. I like that, light at the end of the tunnel. Thank you. It auto filled so I am not sure who’s who. The kids the applicant and I am the sponsor I have to keep this straight. This is mine. I am the preparer and the sponsor. Sure that’s my number because you will call if there’s a problem I hope. 
- Okay I will review. I will assume that’s correct. At this point I wouldn’t notice. It’s weird you need all of the demographics. I know there are certain parts of Arlington. There’s no reason for Freemans corner. I don’t think that’s a factor or that they would tell you why. I don’t care about the birth sex so that is irrelevant. I would just rather ignore that stuff. I am confirming this, and it is mind numbing. 
- Reviewing is painstaking for someone that is not patient. Prolonged going through all of this. Do you really want me to do all of this. 
- Did you review before submitting: if I did it was simpler and a lot shorter. Super short and simple. 
- This is worse than the real thing. Maybe because it is on the phone. I didn’t upload the letter so I wouldn’t actually submit it at this time
- Required to upload something: I think that’s what it said. I would need to go back. I would have written down my list of things I needed. If applying for a child with a disability you need the doctor’s letter. I suppose if they are already in the system as a dependent it could be there. Theoretically I wouldn’t need to provide the dd214 either if that were the case so yes I would need to go back and provide that as well or confirm I need to then submit the application. 
- At this point what would you do: I took a screen capture of the number already but this confirmation number is different so I would save this. 

## Post-Task Interview - 5-10 minutes
Wonderful! Thank you so much for walking through that with us and telling us your thoughts. We just have a few questions to ask before we wrap up our session for today. 
- What did you think of the application process overall? It is relatively simpler, but I had expectations that it would be simpler. Maybe because it’s involving a third party and on a mobile device. It wasn’t that bad I think I got hung up in not knowing how far to play it real and when not to. 
- On a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest, how would you rate the application process for Pre-Need that you just experienced?  I guess a 4. 
- On a scale of 1 to 5, how mobile-friendly do you think it is? Umi guess a 5 I have seen horrible things. Everything seems to fit so ill give them credit. 
- If you could snap your fingers and recreate the application process for pre-need to make it better, what would that process look like?  I like that it remembers what I do as I do. It would be handy to have the check list built in for what I need to provide. That whole question of needing to upload more seems like more coding but as a dumb user I want what I want. 
- Is there anything else on your mind that we didn't ask?
- I'm going to ask my colleagues [Charlie or Cindy] if they have questions at this time **Only if there are observers:** and also check the channel to see if any of our observers have any questions. [Check Teams chat for questions]
-  Applied a month ago, how was that compared to this experience: oddly enough I think it was easier and faster. I think it was because it was for me, and I had everything. It is different applying for oneself and knowing the situation. 
-  So if this participant works with va.gov, professional opinion on this application: I don’t work in va.gov. 
-  Professional opinion on this application compared to others:  Pretty par. It is average. Like it is the same as others. 
- Do you have any questions for me? 

## Thank You and Closing - 2 minutes

- Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the VA.gov Pre-Need application to make sure that it really works for Veterans.
- Thanks so much! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
- Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!

**STOP RECORDING** 

- **Ask observers for top takeaways after participant has dropped**

## Emergency Exit

> [In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it’s easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
