# Conversation Guide: Pre-Need Eligibility Determination Application (VA Form 40-10007), Usability Research of Pre-Integration Enhancements, June 2023

## Moderator logistics

- _Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers._
- _Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel))._
- _Mute your Slack and computer notifications._

### Before you start the session
- _Make sure everyone except the participant and moderator are on mute._
- _In the Audio section, tap the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked._
- _Check your [screensharing setup]. Make sure they are setup on Zoom app and ready to screenshare._
- _Check to make sure participants will be able to share their screen in Zoom (Share Screen button, Advanced Sharing Options)_
- _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

## Project-Specific Setup and Intro - 10 minutes

- _[Moderator turns on camera. Waits to admit observers until consent is received from participant]_ 
- Thanks for joining us today! My name is [moderator name] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today, we're going to review a prototype of the VA pre-need application for eligibility determination at a VA national cemetery. We're working on improvements to the form, so it's important that we get feedback from users.
- This entire session should take about 45 minutes or less. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question.
- You'll be taking a look at a prototype of the application. This prototype is basically made up of images or mockups so none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits and none of your details are collected at any point or associated to your comments. As you click through the prototype, the fields will prefill with test data. 
- If, for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - _If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom._
   - _If yes: Admit observers._ 
    - _Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)_
   - _Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth. Moderator can turn off camera._
- Are you on a desktop, mobile or tablet device?
- I'm going to send you a link in the chat that I would like for you to open.

**If they have trouble locating the chat or with sharing, talk them through finding the chat window to locate the prototype link and the Zoom screen sharing features.** [Zoom share screen directions](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen-or-desktop-on-Zoom)

_Can actually do this while explaining to them where to find “Chat” and “Share,” so by the end we're looking at their screen, then move onto recording._

- Okay, now I'm going to ask you to share your screen in Zoom so that we can look at the prototype together and then we'll begin.

**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You can tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

**Recording Instructions**

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - **If yes:** Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more. 
    - **If no:** That's ok. We can use our notes to complete our analysis.

*If yes, start recording to the Cloud.*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?"
- Ok. Now we're really ready to begin!

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
- To start, I'd like to ask you a few warm-up questions.
- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? [Determine if they're a Veteran, family member, or a personal representative]
“48 years old. Professor of Education. In Army and medically discharged. Military journalist. Use VA benefits and disabilities.”
- Did you know that you could apply to see if you're eligible to be buried in a national cemetery at any time?
“They sent it to me when I started VA healthcare. Seemed like an odd time to send the information.”
       - If so, how did you find out?
- What do you think qualifies you to be buried in a national cemetery?
“I’m not sure. I’m thinking percentage of disability qualifies me. My grandparents are all buried in a national cemetery.”
- When thinking about planning for your burial, would you prefer to be buried in a national cemetery?
“I’ve gone back and forth since they sent me the information. I’m not 100% certain.”
- Have you applied before to see if you're eligible for burial in a national cemetery? 
    - If Yes: Could you describe how that process went and your thoughts about it?
    - If No: Is that something you would be interested in doing at some point?
“I haven’t officially applied. I went on the website to look but didn’t apply yet.”

## Getting Started - 1 minute

- When applying to see if you're eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery, the VA Pre-Need application can be used. I'm going to give you a scenario for you to walk through a prototype of this application and give us your thoughts.
- The prototype link I shared is a work in progress, so there might be a few mistakes, or it may not function exactly the way you expect, which is ok. Some areas will be clickable and some will not and some fields will fill in when you click on them.
- While you're going through the scenario, it would be really helpful if you'd think aloud - kind of like you'd do if you were talking to yourself. We are interested in your first reactions, what you're thinking & wondering as you go through the process. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn, so we want to hear your honest opinions. We're not testing your ability. We just want to improve the form to better meet Veteran's needs. We won't be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your feedback.
- When you think aloud, it helps us understand what works well and where we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free to ask them along the way. 

[Note:  Each participant will go through **ONE** of the tasks below.]

## Task 1: Applying for Self - Applicant is Veteran - 15 minutes

## Task 2: Applying for Self - Applicant is Non-Veteran - 15 minutes

Ok, in the prototype we're looking at the start of the Pre-Need application. 
- **Scenario:** For your scenario, pretend that you are Sammy Smith, the **spouse** of a service member in the Navy. You want to plan for the future and find out if you're eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery. Your spouse is sponsoring your benefits. How would you go about filling out this application?  You will sign in to fill out the form.

### Questions to ask as they go through scenario
- **Introduction**
    - What are your thoughts regarding the content on this page?
“First thing that jumps out at me is the pre-need. What do they mean by pre-need? That confuses me. I want to read everything, but I do see the start button. I didn’t know spouses have access to the VA. I had to help my dad with a lot of VA stuff. Pretty straight forward.”
    - Do you feel prepared to start applying?
        - _Things to watch for:
            - Does the user feel the need to click on external links? 
            - Does the user try to open the Privacy Act Statement before continuing?_  
- **Applicant information - Applicant relationship to service member / Veteran**
    - Do you understand how to answer the question this screen is asking? 
“Spouse in this case. Doesn’t seem to want to click on it.”
        - _Things to watch for:
            - Does the user feel the need to open the additional info component? 
            - Does the user experience any confusion in reading details? (Need to scroll to bottom of page)_ 
- **Sponsor information - Sponsor details**
    - What are your thoughts regarding whose details you'll need to provide here? 
“Self-explanatory. Nothing confusing. If I’m a spouse, then sponsor is the actual veteran.”
- **Sponsor information - Sponsor demographics**
    - What do you think about the messaging for potentially sensitive questions?
“I think it’s standard. Anyone going through this will understand you asking the basic questions. It’s not really sensitive information but I get why we have to phrase it that way.”
    - Is anything confusing or concerning to you?
- **Sponsor information - Sponsor's passing **
    - What do you think about the messaging for potentially sensitive questions here?
“I understand the phraseology here.”
    - Is anything confusing or concerning to you?
    - Why do you think this information is collected?
- **Military history - Sponsor's military details**
“I don’t think anyone knows their claim number. I have it saved somewhere. If I’m applying for any sort of benefits for a spouse, I will have the documents on hand. I suspect a fair number of people won’t have these on hand. If it’s not required to put in a claim number, it’ll probably be left blank. I would save and finish late if I didn’t have it on hand. It would be nice to have it show which documents I need to have.”
    - _Keep an eye out for confusion regarding status dropdown options_ 
- **Military history - Sponsor's service periods**
“I like the dropdown menu. I think a lot of people don’t know what their character of service would be.”
    - Are you prepared to answer these questions or would you need to look them up? 
    - What would you do if you didn't have this information on hand?
- **Burial benefits - Previous decedents**
    - What are your thoughts regarding the questions on the page?
“This is a tough one. There is a closer cemetery to me, and another my family is at. Difficult decision to make more than confusion. I don’t know if everyone is fully ready for that decision while filling out the application. I would want to know if I could change it at a later date. I would want to know the rules on having family buried in the same cemetery. Maybe also a link to the specific rules for each cemetery (ex: Arlington).”
    - Do you have thoughts or feedback for this page?
“I’m confused between the deceased and the sponsor.”
- **Supporting docs** 
“I guess they are looking for service documents. Straightforward with other VA applications. Some of us will have multiple documents.”
    - Do you think you would need to upload something here to continue?
    - How would you go about uploading this if you're on a mobile device?
“I have a folder on my iPhone for email PDFs. I hope when I upload, I can get it from the folder I created.”
    - What are your thoughts regarding the allowed file types [PDFs]?
“I think PDF would be fine. Maybe Jpeg some people would prefer. Jpeg might be better for the older generation. I would want an option for the camera to take a photo of a document if needed.”
- **Contact information - Sponsor address/contact details** 
“I wouldn’t open the question for the contact info. If it were more personal or unclear, I would want more details. Like the previous page with the documents. For this, I’m not going to think twice about why the VA wants my contact information. Good to have the number to call at the bottom. If I had questions, I would call that number. As this phase with my confusions, I would call to clear up some things. I would like to see if I’m eligible before I start the application process.”
    - Would you have this on hand or would you need to look it up?
- **Confirmation** 
“I’m always going to want to review. I’ve never done this on the phone before. I usually apply via desktop. This one isn’t a lot of typing or documents so I would consider apply on the phone. Submit.”
    - What would you do at this point?
“Go back to the VA site and see if my appeal status has changed. I’m going to assume everything is done and I’ll get something in the mail confirming. I hope this shows up on the VA website on the status.”
    - When do you think you would get a decision? 

## Task 3: Applying for Someone Else - Applicant is Non-Veteran - 20 minutes

Ok, in the prototype we're looking at the start of the Pre-Need application. 
- **Scenario:** For your scenario, pretend that you are Sammy Smith. You're a navy Veteran, and you want to apply for Pre-Need for your unmarried adult child who is 20 years old. You want to plan for the future and find out if they're eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery under your benefits. How would you go about filling out this application?  You will sign in to fill out the form.

## Post-Task Interview - 5-10 minutes
Wonderful! Thank you so much for walking through that with us and telling us your thoughts. We just have a few questions to ask before we wrap up our session for today. 
- What did you think of the application process overall?
“All looks good. I’m curious about the eligibility requirements now. It would be good if that was the first thing. Phraseology was confusing me a bit (Deceased vs Sponsor). Beyond that, it’s a straightforward process.”
- On a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest, how would you rate the application process for Pre-Need that you just experienced?
“4. Just because of the things I mentioned.”
- On a scale of 1 to 5, how mobile-friendly do you think it is?
“5.”
- If you could snap your fingers and recreate the application process for pre-need to make it better, what would that process look like? 
“Having definitions and criteria being the landing page. Pre-need phrase doesn’t make sense.”
    - How would you do things differently?
- Is there anything else on your mind that we didn't ask?
- Do you have any questions for me?

## Thank You and Closing - 2 minutes

- Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the VA.gov Pre-Need application to make sure that it really works for Veterans.
- Thanks so much! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
- Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
