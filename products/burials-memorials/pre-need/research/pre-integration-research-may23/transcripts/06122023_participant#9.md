# Conversation Guide: Pre-Need Eligibility Determination Application (VA Form 40-10007), Usability Research of Pre-Integration Enhancements, June 2023

## Moderator logistics

- _Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers._ [In this study, we will be using the designated Teams channel to facilitate communications with stakeholders.]
- _Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel))._
- _Mute your Slack and computer notifications._

### Before you start the session
- _Make sure everyone except the participant and moderator are on mute._
- _In the Participant window, tap the More drop-down arrow and make sure "Play join and leave sound" is unchecked._
- _Check your [screensharing setup]. Make sure you are setup on Zoom app and ready to screenshare in case participant can't._
- _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

## Project-Specific Setup and Intro - 10 minutes

- _[Moderator turns on camera. Waits to admit observers until consent is received from participant]_ 
- Thanks for joining us today! My name is [moderator name] and I'm a designer for VA.gov. I also have a colleague on the line, [Charlie or Cindy], observing and taking notes. Today, we're going to review a prototype of the VA Pre-Need application for eligibility determination at a VA national cemetery. We're working on improvements to the form, so it's important that we get feedback from users.
- This entire session should take about 45 minutes or less. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question.
- You'll be taking a look at a prototype of the application. This prototype is basically made up of images or mockups so none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits and none of your details are collected at any point or associated to your comments. As you click through the prototype, the fields will prefill with test data. 
- If, for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow other observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - _**If no:** Use Slack/Teams to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom._
   - _**If yes:** Admit observers._ 
    - _Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)_
   - _Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth. Moderator can turn off camera._

- Are you on a desktop, mobile or tablet device?

- I'm going to send you a link in the chat that I would like for you to open.

[Pre-Integration v0.1 Invasion Prototype UT Link](https://bahdigital.invisionapp.com/console/share/HF26GKB9W7Q)

- Okay, now I'm going to ask you to share your screen in Zoom so that we can look at the prototype together and then we'll begin.
- **Zoom screensharing on desktop:** Locate green Share Screen button on the bottom tool pane.
- **Zoom screensharing on mobile:** Locate Share button in bottom tool panel (it's scrollable and they may need to scroll to see button if off screen), then hit "Start broadcast".

**If they have trouble locating the chat or with sharing, talk them through finding the chat window to locate the prototype link and the Zoom screen sharing features.** [Zoom share screen directions](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen-or-desktop-on-Zoom)

_Can actually do this while explaining to them where to find “Chat” and “Share,” so by the end we're looking at their screen, then move onto recording._


**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You can tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

////// **Recording Instructions** //////

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - **If yes:** Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more. 
    - **If no:** That's ok. We can use our notes to complete our analysis.

*If yes, start recording to the Cloud.*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?" Yes sir. 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
- To start, I'd like to ask you a few warm-up questions.
- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?  Sure Captain Jason Hagg, served in the Marines Corps and was medically retired. 
- Did you know that you could apply to see if you're eligible to be buried in a national cemetery at any time? No I didn’t know that. 
- What do you think qualifies you to be buried in a national cemetery? For me personally my purple heart. 
- When thinking about planning for your burial, would you prefer to be buried in a national cemetery? National. 
- Have you applied before to see if you're eligible for burial in a national cemetery?  Uh I don’t know if I have applied but I looked up the requirements. 
    - If No: Is that something you would be interested in doing at some point? Sure

## Getting Started - 1 minute

- When applying to see if you're eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery, the VA Pre-Need application can be used. I'm going to give you a scenario for you to walk through a prototype of this application and give us your thoughts.
- The prototype link I shared is a work in progress, so there might be a few mistakes, or it may not function exactly the way you expect, which is ok. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not, and some fields will fill in when you click on them.
- While you're going through the scenario, it would be really helpful if you'd think aloud - kind of like you'd do if you were talking to yourself. We are interested in your first reactions, what you're thinking & wondering as you go through the process. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn, so we want to hear your honest opinions. We're not testing your ability. We just want to improve the form to better meet Veteran's needs. We won't be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your feedback.
- When you think aloud, it helps us understand what works well and where we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free to ask them along the way. 

[Note:  Each participant will go through **ONE** of the tasks below.]

## Task 1: Applying for Self - Applicant is Veteran - 15 minutes

Ok, in the prototype we're looking at the start of the Pre-Need application. 
- **Scenario:** For your scenario, pretend that you are Sammy Smith, a Navy Veteran, and that you want to plan for the future and find out if you're eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery. How would you go about filling out this application?  I would sat the next one would be to click on how to schedule. Okay how to prepare before starting the application. For me when looking at this I would click get more details about eligibility then that would determine if I go forward if I am eligible. If I did would it give you the list. 
- Would that be helpful: yes absolutely. I want to figure out as much as I can as fast as I can and if it pops up a floating window that lists the requirement then unclick it and you’re back to here so I would know I am eligible and go down. 
- That would be my biggest thing is that this does not apply to Arlington national cemetery. If this a plan for it to feed into there or is that a separate process. I plan to be buried there that’s why I would ask that question. 
- For me personally if it does not feed into Arlington I would stop here but if it at least got me into the pre-eligibility I would continue. With the disclaimer that it does not apply to Arlington I would stop but for this I would hit sign in. 
- Prefilling the application from being already logged in is very helpful. I would say start the pre-need application because I have all of my stuff saved on my computer like my dd214. 
-  Information below here: oh I’ll look at it. 
- That is helpful so I would click on start the pre-need eligibility. I don’t care about the privacy act statement it doesn’t do anything for me. 


### Questions to ask as they go through scenario
- **Introduction**
    - What are your thoughts regarding the content on this page?
    - Do you feel prepared to start applying?
- **Applicant information - Applicant relationship to service member / Veteran**
- Applying for myself  click on that. Continue. 
    - Do you understand how to answer the question this screen is asking?  Uh yeah I would assume if it’s not me and I passed it would be for my wife trying to finish this. 
- Did I click that wrong. Oh yeah the top one is. 
- What about the phrasing was confusing: the question confused me since it was me. I would think the question would be able to change it seem ambiguous for no reason. I am trying to find out how I would say it. I understand why it’s there. I would click the top one. 
- **Applicant information - Applicant demographics**
-  I don’t need to fill any of that in right, its showing prefilled. 
-  Do you feel obligated to: Yes if it was there more than likely.    
- I would fill this out as male, white. I don’t have anything wrong with whatever they are asking, I would answer them. I am fine with all of the questions I would answer them. 
What do you think about this: I don’t need to be apologized for I understand why you ask them based on my job I know why you do it. The whole we understand to discomfort , for me I don’t need to read that. (Reading page) that’s all I would need to see. 
- **Military history - Military details**
    - _Keep an eye out for confusion regarding status dropdown options_ 
- **Military history - Service periods**
  - That’s fine I don’t have problems with those.
- Now would this be populated automatically
Would that be beneficial: yes having the start and end date which is in our stuff. Branch and rank I don’t think would be hard to remember but it would be helpful to have the start and end date. 
  - Are you prepared to answer these questions, or would you need to look them up?  I would be prepared. Captain, Marines. I only know my start date and I just had to look my end date.
    - What would you do if you didn't have this information on hand? I would look at my dd214 which is already on my computer so that helps. 
- Would you fill this out: Yes I would. 
-  Required verse not required, would it effect your choice: probably. If it is something else to remember like rank I would put it and it’s not hard to find. I can just plug it in. 
- I didn’t know you could serve under another name; I would click no and keep going. I guess for females getting married
How do you feel about these selections: Yeah I mean as long as someone picks up quickly. 
- I mean id fill that out and fill it out for one I found in VA. Then keep going down I guess. I would click no then go forward. 
- **Supporting docs**  
-  I would upload my dd214 right here. Mine is a pdf just like that. Click on that upload and move forward. 
 - Do you think you would need to upload something here to continue?
    - How would you go about uploading this if you're on a mobile device? For me I have it on my phone as well so. 
    - What are your thoughts regarding the allowed file type? Um, in regard to the pdf or word doc. My dd214 has always been in a pdf format since I got out, so it doesn’t seem weird that you’re asking for that. Again more about myself I also work in the veteran space, so I have to provide it a lot. 
- Didn’t click on the additional information, why: I will next mail or fax the documents if I can upload them. It is asking what documents I can upload and it tell me right under what I can upload. Those two things for me I would take out and then go to the bottom and right there where it says need help if you need to mail, or fax click this link. 
- For me because you have our mailing address I would love if it was here then if it needed changed I could manually change it.
- confusing with applications mailing address: Nope. 
- I don’t have issues with them asking for mailing or phone number because they ask that on va.gov always
- Review, I like that. Whoever did it is nice because you can click on it and then go directly back to update it. It is very nice in general and on this application as well
- I would go down. For me I think it’s done it on this. If something is not completely done if it could highlight you didn’t fill out social security that would be helpful. It has helped me in the past. It is annoying when it doesn’t let you keep going. I would click the privacy box then submit.  
- I would click what happens after I applied to find out what happens. Yeah that’s all great information I would scroll down. Okay. 
- **Confirmation** 
    - What would you do at this point? For me personally I would go to the beginning to see the Arlington Cemetery stuff. That’s what I would do. 
    - When do you think you would get a decision? Probably 4-6 weeks is how I deem the VA. 


## Post-Task Interview - 5-10 minutes
Wonderful! Thank you so much for walking through that with us and telling us your thoughts. We just have a few questions to ask before we wrap up our session for today. 
- What did you think of the application process overall? I thought it was seamless and easy. Like I said the biggest thing I would have liked to see or would have been helpful was information on Arlington without going elsewhere. It was easy and seamless to do, it would only take me 5 minutes to complete. 
- On a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest, how would you rate the application process for Pre-Need that you just experienced? I would give you a 5, it was easy. 
- On a scale of 1 to 5, how mobile-friendly do you think it is? Uh from what I can see I would venture to say it is very mobile friendly. 4. 
- If you could snap your fingers and recreate the application process for pre-need to make it better, what would that process look like?  I mean just from looking at it, not much. Being able to have it pre-filled from the information in va.gov is fantastic. I don’t think you can make it much shorter. You are pretty good right now. 
- Is there anything else on your mind that we didn't ask? No I don’t think so. I think everything is easy and self-explanatory. I don’t  see people having issues. For usability I would give it a 5 and for easy of use. 
- I'm going to ask my colleagues [Charlie or Cindy] if they have questions at this time **Only if there are observers:** and also check the channel to see if any of our observers have any questions. 
- Mobile friendly nice, what would make it a 5: Me doing it on my mobile device. 
- Do you have any questions for me? No I think it was easy and super-fast. Hopefully my feedback will help some. 

## Thank You and Closing - 2 minutes

- Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the VA.gov Pre-Need application to make sure that it really works for Veterans.
- Thanks so much! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
- Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!

**STOP RECORDING** 

- **Ask observers for top takeaways after participant has dropped**

## Emergency Exit

> [In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it’s easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
