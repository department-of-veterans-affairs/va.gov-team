# Conversation Guide: Pre-Need Eligibility Determination Application (VA Form 40-10007), Usability Research of Pre-Integration Enhancements, June 2023

## Moderator logistics

- _Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers._ [In this study, we will be using the designated Teams channel to facilitate communications with stakeholders.]
- _Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel))._
- _Mute your Slack and computer notifications._

### Before you start the session
- _Make sure everyone except the participant and moderator are on mute._
- _In the Participant window, tap the More drop-down arrow and make sure "Play join and leave sound" is unchecked._
- _Check your [screensharing setup]. Make sure you are setup on Zoom app and ready to screenshare in case participant can't._
- _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

## Project-Specific Setup and Intro - 10 minutes

- _[Moderator turns on camera. Waits to admit observers until consent is received from participant]_ 
- Thanks for joining us today! My name is [moderator name] and I'm a designer for VA.gov. I also have a colleague on the line, [Charlie or Cindy], observing and taking notes. Today, we're going to review a prototype of the VA Pre-Need application for eligibility determination at a VA national cemetery. We're working on improvements to the form, so it's important that we get feedback from users.
- This entire session should take about 45 minutes or less. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question.
- You'll be taking a look at a prototype of the application. This prototype is basically made up of images or mockups so none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits and none of your details are collected at any point or associated to your comments. As you click through the prototype, the fields will prefill with test data. 
- If, for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow other observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - _**If no:** Use Slack/Teams to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom._
   - _**If yes:** Admit observers._ 
    - _Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)_
   - _Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth. Moderator can turn off camera._

- Are you on a desktop, mobile or tablet device?

- I'm going to send you a link in the chat that I would like for you to open.

- Okay, now I'm going to ask you to share your screen in Zoom so that we can look at the prototype together and then we'll begin.
- **Zoom screensharing on desktop:** Locate green Share Screen button on the bottom tool pane.
- **Zoom screensharing on mobile:** Locate Share button in bottom tool panel (it's scrollable and they may need to scroll to see button if off screen), then hit "Start broadcast".

**If they have trouble locating the chat or with sharing, talk them through finding the chat window to locate the prototype link and the Zoom screen sharing features.** [Zoom share screen directions](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen-or-desktop-on-Zoom)

_Can actually do this while explaining to them where to find “Chat” and “Share,” so by the end we're looking at their screen, then move onto recording._


**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You can tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

////// **Recording Instructions** //////

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - **If yes:** Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more. 
    - **If no:** That's ok. We can use our notes to complete our analysis.

*If yes, start recording to the Cloud.*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?" Yes. 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
- To start, I'd like to ask you a few warm-up questions.
- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? I spent my time in the military form 84 to 86. Stayed in the states, I was radar repair man. That’s about it. 
- Did you know that you could apply to see if you're eligible to be buried in a national cemetery at any time? No I didn’t. 
- What do you think qualifies you to be buried in a national cemetery? Probably honorable discharge. 
- When thinking about planning for your burial, would you prefer to be buried in a national cemetery? I haven’t even decided yet, I know I should. I am between cremation and burial. 
- Have you applied before to see if you're eligible for burial in a national cemetery? No I haven’t. 

## Getting Started - 1 minute

- When applying to see if you're eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery, the VA Pre-Need application can be used. I'm going to give you a scenario for you to walk through a prototype of this application and give us your thoughts.
- The prototype link I shared is a work in progress, so there might be a few mistakes, or it may not function exactly the way you expect, which is ok. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not, and some fields will fill in when you click on them.
- While you're going through the scenario, it would be really helpful if you'd think aloud - kind of like you'd do if you were talking to yourself. We are interested in your first reactions, what you're thinking & wondering as you go through the process. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn, so we want to hear your honest opinions. We're not testing your ability. We just want to improve the form to better meet Veteran's needs. We won't be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your feedback.
- When you think aloud, it helps us understand what works well and where we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free to ask them along the way. 

[Note:  Each participant will go through **ONE** of the tasks below.]

## Task 1: Applying for Self - Applicant is Veteran - 15 minutes

Ok, in the prototype we're looking at an information page about pre-need. I'm going to briefly have you take a look at it before you start the application.
- Questions before starting: No I think it’s pretty clear. 
- **Scenario:** For your scenario, pretend that you are Sammy Smith, a Navy Veteran, and that you want to plan for the future and find out if you're eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery. How would you go about filling out this application? (Reading page)  Well let’s see, I would need to make sure I had the social security, place of birth, military status, rank, and everything. Discharge papers dd214 before I started it looks like. 
-  Where would you start: Let’s see. Here it says apply for pre-need eligibility under how do I apply. 
- Under apply the start the eligibility process. (Reading page) I would be applying for myself. Continue. 

### Questions to ask as they go through scenario
- **Introduction**
    - What are your thoughts regarding the content on this page?
    - Do you feel prepared to start applying?
    
- **Applicant information - Applicant relationship to service member / Veteran**
-  Service member or veteran, continue.     
- There we go, okay. Sammy Smith, okay. 
- **Applicant information - Applicant demographics**
   - Hopefully, it’s male, why is it. This one says required but wont let me pick male. Okay it’s a female, okay. I am thinking white nope, American dean okay. Okay 
- Questions: it was basic beside I didn’t know their gender and ethnicity. Other than that it was pretty easy. 
- **Military history - Military details**
- I am looking at the details like social security number, va claim number if known, current military status but it doesn’t click it goes to back. Okay. So. Okay, I got that done. Why did it disappear here. It still won’t let me do anything in the required section. The social number isn’t required and va claim isn’t required. I keep trying to click on military status because it is required but it takes me back. What do I do here. There we go okay. 
- **Military history - Service periods**
- Branch of service Navy, okay. Honorable I would hope. 
    - Are you prepared to answer these questions, or would you need to look them up?  Yeah because I have my DD214 here. 
- Which national cemetery would like to be burial, okay. Is anyone burial under your eligibility, yes interesting okay. (Reading page) okay. 
    - What would you do if you didn't have this information on hand?
- **Supporting docs** 
- (Reading page) Okay, what kind of documents can I upload. Okay. Can I mail or fax documents. People still fax. 
    - Do you think you would need to upload something here to continue? I am sure it would yeah but apparently it won’t do that. Yeah at least the DD214. 
    - How would you go about uploading this if you're on a mobile device? Take a picture of it. 
    - What are your thoughts regarding the allowed file type? A PDF, I don’t think that would be a problem. I am not sure how to upload on a phone. I would probably do this on a computer that was I can scan the DD214 and then send it through that file. That way it would be a PDF.
-  Issues doing it through your phone in PDF form: Probably. 
- **Confirmation** 
- Review: Everything looks okay. 
    - What would you do at this point? Write down the submission number if I see it, confirmation number and the date submitted. Then wait for someone to get back to me. 
    - When do you think you would get a decision?  Ah with as many probably as long as it takes. I would say not more than a month I would hope. 
-  Experience with previous applications: No I am just guessing about the length. With all of the veterans there are probably a lot. 


## Post-Task Interview - 5-10 minutes
Wonderful! Thank you so much for walking through that with us and telling us your thoughts. We just have a few questions to ask before we wrap up our session for today. 
- What did you think of the application process overall? It was simple and self-explanatory. 
- On a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest, how would you rate the application process for Pre-Need that you just experienced? Probably about a 5, it could get complicated here and there but it’s not too bad. 
- On a scale of 1 to 5, how mobile-friendly do you think it is? Probably about a 3, with people not knowing how to download it would be a problem
-  A specific page: The documents where you need to download on a PDF. I don’t know how to do it and I am sure there are a lot of others like that. I could ask my daughter and she could do it but not me. 
- If you could snap your fingers and recreate the application process for pre-need to make it better, what would that process look like? Um. I don’t really see anything that would need to be changed. 
- Is there anything else on your mind that we didn't ask? No you did a great job. 
- I'm going to ask my colleagues [Charlie or Cindy] if they have questions at this time **Only if there are observers:** and also check the channel to see if any of our observers have any questions. 
- On the first page you spent time reading it verse the rest where it seemed like you went through it faster, anything difficult to understand: No there was just a lot of read and see what was there. Other than that the application was easy for me otherwise. 
- Do you have any questions for me? No Ma’am. 

## Thank You and Closing - 2 minutes

- Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the VA.gov Pre-Need application to make sure that it really works for Veterans.
- Thanks so much! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
- Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!

**STOP RECORDING** 

- **Ask observers for top takeaways after participant has dropped**

## Emergency Exit

> [In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it’s easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
