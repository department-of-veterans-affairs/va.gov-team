# Conversation Guide: Pre-Need Eligibility Determination Application (VA Form 40-10007), Usability Research of Pre-Integration Enhancements, June 2023

## Moderator logistics

- _Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers._ [In this study, we will be using the designated Teams channel to facilitate communications with stakeholders.]
- _Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel))._
- _Mute your Slack and computer notifications._

### Before you start the session
- _Make sure everyone except the participant and moderator are on mute._
- _In the Participant window, tap the More drop-down arrow and make sure "Play join and leave sound" is unchecked._
- _Check your [screensharing setup]. Make sure you are setup on Zoom app and ready to screenshare in case participant can't._
- _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

## Project-Specific Setup and Intro - 10 minutes

- _[Moderator turns on camera. Waits to admit observers until consent is received from participant]_ 
- Thanks for joining us today! My name is [moderator name] and I'm a designer for VA.gov. I also have a colleague on the line, [Charlie or Cindy], observing and taking notes. Today, we're going to review a prototype of the VA Pre-Need application for eligibility determination at a VA national cemetery. We're working on improvements to the form, so it's important that we get feedback from users.
- This entire session should take about 45 minutes or less. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question.
- You'll be taking a look at a prototype of the application. This prototype is basically made up of images or mockups so none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits and none of your details are collected at any point or associated to your comments. As you click through the prototype, the fields will prefill with test data. 
- If, for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow other observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - _**If no:** Use Slack/Teams to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom._
   - _**If yes:** Admit observers._ 
    - _Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)_
   - _Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth. Moderator can turn off camera._

- Are you on a desktop, mobile or tablet device?

- I'm going to send you a link in the chat that I would like for you to open.

[Pre-Integration v0.1 Invasion Prototype UT Link](https://bahdigital.invisionapp.com/console/share/HF26GKB9W7Q)

- Okay, now I'm going to ask you to share your screen in Zoom so that we can look at the prototype together and then we'll begin.
- **Zoom screensharing on desktop:** Locate green Share Screen button on the bottom tool pane.
- **Zoom screensharing on mobile:** Locate Share button in bottom tool panel (it's scrollable and they may need to scroll to see button if off screen), then hit "Start broadcast".

**If they have trouble locating the chat or with sharing, talk them through finding the chat window to locate the prototype link and the Zoom screen sharing features.** [Zoom share screen directions](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen-or-desktop-on-Zoom)

_Can actually do this while explaining to them where to find “Chat” and “Share,” so by the end we're looking at their screen, then move onto recording._


**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You can tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

////// **Recording Instructions** //////

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - **If yes:** Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more. 
    - **If no:** That's ok. We can use our notes to complete our analysis.

*If yes, start recording to the Cloud.*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?" Yes. 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? That’ll take all day what do you want to know. I am a veteran 100 percent disabled. I enlisted in the Marines in 1986, got injured in desert storm and was discharged in 1994 and have been working as software developer. 
- Did you know that you could apply to see if you're eligible to be buried in a national cemetery at any time? Yes
       - If so, how did you find out? When I buried my father-in-law. 
- What do you think qualifies you to be buried in a national cemetery? Honorable active-duty service. 
- When thinking about planning for your burial, would you prefer to be buried in a national cemetery? I would probably just go to the national on since it is local to us.  
- Have you applied before to see if you're eligible for burial in a national cemetery? I have not but I assume I am eligible. 

    - If No: Is that something you would be interested in doing at some point? Sure. 

## Getting Started - 1 minute

- When applying to see if you're eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery, the VA Pre-Need application can be used. I'm going to give you a scenario for you to walk through a prototype of this application and give us your thoughts.
- The prototype link I shared is a work in progress, so there might be a few mistakes, or it may not function exactly the way you expect, which is ok. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not, and some fields will fill in when you click on them.
- While you're going through the scenario, it would be really helpful if you'd think aloud - kind of like you'd do if you were talking to yourself. We are interested in your first reactions, what you're thinking & wondering as you go through the process. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn, so we want to hear your honest opinions. We're not testing your ability. We just want to improve the form to better meet Veteran's needs. We won't be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your feedback.
- When you think aloud, it helps us understand what works well and where we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free to ask them along the way. 

[Note:  Each participant will go through **ONE** of the tasks below.]

## Task 3: Applying for Someone Else - Applicant is non-Veteran - 20 minutes

Ok, in the prototype we're looking at an information page about pre-need. I'm going to briefly have you take a look at it before you start the application. 

- **Scenario:** For your scenario, pretend that you are Sammy Smith. You're a navy Veteran, and you have a disabled unmarried adult child who is 20 years old. You want to plan for the future and find out if your adult child is eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery under your benefits. How would you go about filling out this application?  So I guess obviously it’s the phone. I guess the menus would be different. Here I would want to see what’s in this section, but that menu didn’t do anything. So I would need to read the form. I am reading through the form now trying to go through what it says. So I guess the first section says one of these must describe you. The first one described me as a navy veteran then this one of adult child of a service member. Choose where you want to be buried. Since I already know which one I want to be at I wouldn’t need to find one but if I did I would click on here. Nothing happened when I clicked here. To verify these links work. No I need to see what I need to gather. Be sure to fill out the form, it says what I need. (Reading page) This would be the section that applies to this scenario. Then I guess once I have all of the information needed I would click the green button. I can also apply by mail and fax. I would click this button before going further so I might not read that. It didn’t work. There we go. Alright no. Now it says it can prefill some. I guess I would start right away or go through the list. 

### Questions to ask as they go through scenario
- **Introduction**
    - What are your thoughts regarding the content on this page? My first thought is if you have a link to start the process is don’t know why, they would miss the steps. Is this a shortcut in case people don’t want to read the instructions. You have the link then you  can read the instructions which look like, yeah just instructions. That’s the same link as above. If I clicked this I would miss everything below.
    - Do you feel prepared to start applying? Yes the previous page told me everything I needed. 
- **Applicant information - Applicant relationship to service member / Veteran**
    - On this one I would just want to double check. So is the disabled child able to sign the application or not. 
- This wording: if I had a disabled child I would know. This one says if they are physically able to sign then I cannot fill this out. If I click apply for someone else. Then I would assume they would need to sign it. We can go through the form to see what happen. Does this mean that I am looking as a veteran am I looking for. That is actually a little confusing. If I am looking to see if I have the benefits to burial my child then would I fill it out for myself since I am the veteran or does that mean I am applying for someone else which would be my child. That’s where it is confusing for me. Chances are if I got this far I would click applying for someone else and if it looked like I was in the wrong form I would start all over again. 
- Do you understand how to answer the question this screen is asking? 
- **Sponsor information - Are you the sponsor? Y/N**
    - This makes it more clear, unmarri3ed child is the relationship. Okay. 
Questions on what to fill in: it is self-explanatory. The only thing is that this put the social security without formatting, so I don’t know if they put in dashes. They are used to doing that so either removing the dashes after entering or maybe giving them a hint not to enter the dashes. I probably would have entered the dashes if I typed it myself. 
Not required: No because they aren’t required. I would think, so for example a suffix if they were a Jr then I would put it in there, but I don’t know if this person is or not. So I guess they aren’t. They are unmarried so there wouldn’t be an unmarried name. 
- **Sponsor information - Sponsor details**
    - There it is what is a sponsor. That would’ve been my only question. It is good that you have that explanation 
- Same comment on the social security number, have instructions that include no dashes or remove once done. 
- **Sponsor information - Sponsor demographics**
- Confusion between applicant and sponsor: no, on the previous form this what is a sponsor told me what it was so once I read that I knew what a sponsor was. 
- Alright. In this scenario what should I put. 
    - What do you think about the messaging for potentially sensitive questions? Um. It seems bullet point for government forms anymore. You see that in just about every form or something similar. 
    - What are your thoughts on the questions themselves? They are fine for me I guess; this is pretty standard for government forms for statistical purposes. It is pretty standard I don’t have any comments on it. 
- **Military history - Sponsor's military details**
  - So this one claim number, you have the application number here. What’s the claim number related to. That’s what I don’t know what it means as it relates to burial. I know what it means for benefits claims for compensation or something else they assign a claim number. I don’t know how it applies to this because they assign an application number. 
- What would help you understand that better: an explanation like where it had what is a sponsor. Have what is a va claim number, where to find it and if it applies to me. 
- **Military history - Sponsor's service periods**
 - Is that normally a drop down. Okay. 
   - Are you prepared to answer these questions, or would you need to look them up?  Yeah that comes right off of the DD214, that was a required form so they can get that right off of there.
Do you feel obligated t research it: I would click finish this application later and get the information. 
- I guess there are some people with multiple service periods if they are in guard or something. 
- Maybe an explanation of when they served they had a different last name . would that be what that question is for
- Would that help clarify the question: yes. I could see that if someone married and changed their name after the service they may have a different name than they served under. Probably since they are filling it out they probably has an established va account but maybe just in case an explanation of what that would mean. 
- Okay that makes sense then. 
-  Do you understand how the questions are stated: Yes by checking yes they need more information about the name they served under previously. That fit the scenario I was talking about with being single than getting married or changed the last name. 
- **Burial benefits - Previous decedents**
- Is that where you start typing it and it suggests, there are obviously more than what was just listed. 
- Would you understand what you are doing here : Yeah I mean so under the sponsors eligibility. The veterans, veteran spouse, and disabled children. If the spouse was buried there you could say yes, they would know that. That makes sense. 
- **Supporting docs** 
- Here we are at supporting documents. That is understandable. So those two are clear explanations. I work with a lot of older veterans and trying to have them figure out how to upload a document from their phone is nearly impossible. 
- How do they upload: they prefer to mail things so the explanation that they can mail in the forms. A lot of the times they will try to get some help so they will call someone to help them. Most of the guys I work with are mid to late 70’s so technology can be challenging for them. Once you tell them how to do it once or twice they can figure it out. 
- Need help section, have you seen people use the numbers: I have seen veterans when they call the va to get help. I am guessing they get transferred to the right person, but I don’t have personal experience with the national cemetery scheduling office, but I know they call the va a lot. 
    - How would you go about uploading this if you're on a mobile device? If I am using my phone, I would guess when I click the button I can take pictures to upload them that way. If they want me to find other files it might be more challenging because where are they stored on the phone. It is probably a little easier to do on a desktop. 
    - What are your thoughts regarding the allowed file types [PDFs]? Um I am pretty technologically advanced, and I find it challenging to make documents into pdfs from my phone. Even most vets probably don’t have document scanners for desktops. It might be hard for them to come up with PDFs for documents. If they could take a picture and upload it as a jpeg. Otherwise trying to get them to convert a picture into a pdf might be challenging. 
- Does this mean upload another file because the first time when I was here I never saw it asking me to attach something. It came up with the document name, maybe because it is a demo it doesn’t have all functions like attaching a file. 
- **Contact information - Sponsor address/contact details** 
    - Would you have this on hand, or would you need to look it up? I would guess. If I am doing it for the dependent that child is living with me I assume so. Again we are talking me the veteran and applying for the dependent child or spouse calling them an applicant is what you are doing. We established earlier the applicants the one getting the benefits not the sponsor. 
- **Contact information - Preparer info/address/contact details** 
  -  Personally if I were to fill this out I would appreciate a check box that says the same as the applicant’s address, so I didn’t need to fill this in again. If the applicant and sponsor live in the same house it would save a lot of time and steps. In this form you have ethe prepare, applicant and sponsor. As long as the rolls are clear at the start. 
- Blue box: since I am the sponsor they prefilled out the information. That it pretty obvious. I mean I don’t have any comments on it because it was obvious that when I got here it was already prefilled out. 
- Same here. 
- **Confirmation** 
Review: Just reviewing everything I entered previously. Is this right here and this right here the same. Isn’t it sponsor, your sponsor. 
What would make you question those: it is stating the same thing, maybe I missed it the first time. I thought I only answered it once, but it is all duplicated, sex, category, and marital status is repeated here and here and here. That looks confusing, why would it be there. It looks like it is there for no reason. It is all for the sponsors, it looks like this area here is a mistake. 
Obligated to check all answers: Personally, I would like to make sure everything I indicated was filled out. I would check it to make sure it is filled out correctly. I would assume most people would if they got here. Maybe some instructions, to see it. For me it is obvious but for older people not much. 
Submit
    - What would you do at this point? Well if I don’t need to send more documents because I attached them to the form. Maybe I would check on what happens after you apply and check my email to see if there is feedback. Maybe that’s how you find out what happens next. Nothing happens. 
    - When do you think you would get a decision? It could take up to a year. It is the VA

## Post-Task Interview - 5-10 minutes
Wonderful! Thank you so much for walking through that with us and telling us your thoughts. We just have a few questions to ask before we wrap up our session for today. 
- What did you think of the application process overall? It was fine, it is a standard VA form. They are getting better. 
- On a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest, how would you rate the application process for Pre-Need that you just experienced? It was pretty easy so maybe not perfect so a 4 out of 5. 
- On a scale of 1 to 5, how mobile-friendly do you think it is? It looked fine, the menus were fine. Um yeah I think it works week for mobile. Let’s say a few things didn’t work so a 4 out of 5. 
- If you could snap your fingers and recreate the application process for pre-need to make it better, what would that process look like?  Oh um. I might make it a bit more of an interview like who are you filling it out for. It was there but part of the confusion was deciding if I am the veteran and who’s the applicant and if I am applying for services for a dependent if I was the application. If someone was sitting across form me they would be asking me questions. Make it that way. From me working with older veterans they need to be walked through stuff. 
- Is there anything else on your mind that we didn't ask?
- I'm going to ask my colleagues [Charlie or Cindy] if they have questions at this time **Only if there are observers:** and also check the channel to see if any of our observers have any questions. [Check Teams chat for questions]
Hi, were at time. We are unable to go much further due to compensation purposes. 
- Do you have any questions for me? Not at all. 

## Thank You and Closing - 2 minutes

- Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the VA.gov Pre-Need application to make sure that it really works for Veterans.
- Thanks so much! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
- Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!

**STOP RECORDING** 

- **Ask observers for top takeaways after participant has dropped**

## Emergency Exit

> [In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it’s easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
