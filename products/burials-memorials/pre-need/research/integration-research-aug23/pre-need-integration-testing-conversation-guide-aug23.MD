# Conversation Guide: Pre-Need Eligibility Determination Application (VA Form 40-10007), Usability Research of Integration Enhancements, August 2023

## Moderator logistics

- _Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers._ [In this study, we will be using the designated Teams channel to facilitate communications with stakeholders.]
- _Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel))._
- _Mute your Slack and computer notifications._
- _Share the GitHub participant doc with Perigean for notetaking._

### Before you start the session
- _Make sure everyone except the participant and moderator are on mute._
- _In the Participant window, tap the More drop-down arrow and make sure "Play join and leave sound" is unchecked._
- _Check your [screensharing setup]. Make sure you are setup on Zoom app and ready to screenshare in case participant can't._
- _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

## Project-Specific Setup and Intro - 10 minutes

- _[Moderator turns on camera. Waits to admit observers until consent is received from participant]_ 
- Thanks for joining us today! My name is [moderator name] and I'm a designer for VA.gov. I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today, we're going to review a prototype of the VA Pre-Need application for eligibility determination at a VA national cemetery. We're working on improvements to the form, so it's important that we get feedback from users.
- This entire session should take about 45 minutes or less. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question.
- You'll be taking a look at a prototype of the application. This prototype is basically made up of images or mockups so none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits and none of your details are collected at any point or associated to your comments. As you click through the prototype, the fields will prefill with test data. 
- If, for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow other observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - _**If no:** Use Slack/Teams to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom._
   - _**If yes:** Admit observers._ 
    - _Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)_
   - _Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth. Moderator can turn off camera._

- I'd like to confirm that you're on a [device they specified from participant tracker]

- I'm going to send you a link in the chat that I would like for you to open.

[Integration v0.1 InVision Prototype Link](https://bahdigital.invisionapp.com/console/share/6DUFGR3ZVMN)

- Okay, now I'm going to ask you to share your screen in Zoom so that we can look at the prototype together and then we'll begin.
- **Zoom screensharing on desktop:** Locate green Share Screen button on the bottom tool pane.
- **Zoom screensharing on mobile:** Locate Share button in bottom tool panel (it's scrollable and they may need to scroll to see button if off screen), then hit "Start broadcast".

**If they have trouble locating the chat or with sharing, talk them through finding the chat window to locate the prototype link and the Zoom screen sharing features.** [Zoom share screen directions](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen-or-desktop-on-Zoom)

_Can actually do this while explaining to them where to find “Chat” and “Share,” so by the end we're looking at their screen, then move onto recording._


**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You can tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

////// **Recording Instructions** //////

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - **If yes:** Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more. 
    - **If no:** That's ok. We can use our notes to complete our analysis.

*If yes, start recording to the Cloud.*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?"
- Ok. Now we're ready to begin!

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
- To start, I'd like to ask you a few warm-up questions.
- Can you briefly tell me about your background with the military? [Determine if they're a Veteran, family member, or a personal representative]
- Did you know that you could apply to see if you're eligible to be buried in a national cemetery?
       - If so, how did you find out?
- What do you think qualifies you to be buried in a national cemetery?
- When thinking about planning for your burial, would you prefer to be buried in a national cemetery?
- Have you applied before to see if you're eligible for burial in a national cemetery? 
    - If Yes: Could you describe how that process went and your thoughts about it?
    - If No: Is that something you would be interested in doing at some point?

## Getting Started - 1 minute

- When applying to see if you're eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery, the VA Pre-Need application can be used. I'm going to give you a scenario for you to walk through a prototype of this application and give us your thoughts.
- The prototype link I shared is a work in progress, so there might be a few mistakes, or it may not function exactly the way you expect, which is ok. Some areas will be clickable and some will not and some fields will fill in when you click on them.
- While you're going through the scenario, it would be really helpful if you'd think aloud - kind of like you'd do if you were talking to yourself. We are interested in your first reactions, what you're thinking & wondering as you go through the process. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn, so we want to hear your honest opinions. We're not testing your abilities. We just want to improve the form to better meet Veteran's needs. We won't be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your feedback.
- When you think aloud, it helps us understand what works well and where we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free to ask them along the way. 

_**Note:** Each participant will go through **ONE** of the tasks below._

## Post-Task Interview - 5-10 minutes
Wonderful! Thank you so much for walking through that with us and telling us your thoughts. We just have a few questions to ask before we wrap up our session for today. 
- What did you think of the application process overall?
- On a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest, how would you rate the application process for Pre-Need that you just experienced?
- On a scale of 1 to 5, how mobile-friendly do you think it is?
- If you could snap your fingers and recreate the application process for pre-need to make it better, what would that process look like? 
    - How would you do things differently?
- Is there anything else on your mind that we didn't ask?
- I'm going to ask my colleage [Charlie or Cindy] if they have questions at this time **Only if there are observers:** and also check the channel to see if any of our observers have any questions. [Check Teams chat for questions]
- Do you have any questions for me?

## Thank You and Closing - 2 minutes

- Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the VA.gov Pre-Need application to make sure that it really works for Veterans.
- Thanks so much! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
- Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

**STOP RECORDING**
