[Criteria Issue](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/354) 

## Summary

High level questions this research was trying to answer:

The goals of this user research are to: 
 - Learn how users experience applying for pre-need as it relates to the addition of new fields for Integration, and determine what's working well and if pain points exist.
    - How will the new Integration fields impact users' application process?
    - Do users understand what to provide for the new fields and can they easily complete them?
    - Are users comfortable with the language for potentially sensitive new fields?
  * Determine if flow enhancements to the grouping of pages mitigate user confusion with the entering of their details.
    - Can users easily enter their details, as information is collected for up to four people/roles in the form (applicant, sponsor, preparer, previous decedents), and is it simple for them to determine in which sections of the form they need to provide these details?
    - Which areas of the pre-need application are potentially confusing for users, particularly in determining whose details they need to enter throughout?
    - Do they understand the difference between an Applicant, a Sponsor, a Previous Decedent, and a Preparer? 
* For additional integration enhancements, determine what's working well and what isn't.
    - Are there additional opportunities to simplify the user experience, particularly since Integration will require the inclusion of new fields?
   - Are there any enhancements to address Corey Shea Act applicants that would be helpful?
