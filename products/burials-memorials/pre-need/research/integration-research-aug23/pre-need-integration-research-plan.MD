# Integration Research Plan for MBS Self-Service Team, Application for Pre-Need Eligibility Determination (VA Form 40-10007), Aug 2023

## Background
The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) is working to modernize its systems, including the system that processes pre-need applications (VA Form 40-10007) for determining eligibility for burial in a VA national cemetery. Presently, pre-need cases are processed in the newly-modernized system and in the legacy system which will sunset eventually. Analysts are swiveling between the two systems to manage cases, which impacts timeliness measures for Eligibility Office (EO) analysts and Scheduling Office (SO) agents at the National Cemetery Scheduling Office (NCSO). Ultimately, users applying for pre-need are impacted, as eligibility determinations are delayed due to longer processing times.

The application for Pre-Need Eligibility Determination (VA Form 40-10007) is offered to Veterans, service members, family members, and representatives as both authorized/unauthorized experiences, and it is accessible through the Burials and Memorials hub page on VA.gov. 

Based on previous research and the overall goals for the project, our plan for the Pre-Need digital form is to: 
1. Continue releasing incremental enhancements in a "Pre-Integration" phase (before the application is integrated with modern systems)  
2. Release enhancements in an "Integration" phase in which the form will be fully integrated with the modernized system to allow for faster case processing
3. Explore the possibilities of a "short form" for pre-need that will automatically convey eligibility for certain users applying for pre-need with access to this version of the form.

For this research study, our aim is to focus on the testing of Integration phase requirements and enhancements.

### OCTO Priorities 
This research supports the following 2023 OCTO objectives:
  * Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience

### Veteran Journey
The Pre-Need application applies to life stages from **Serving** onward to **Dying**, as service members, Veterans, family members, and representatives may apply at any time to determine if applicants are eligible for burial in VA national cemeteries. 

## Research Goals / Questions	
The goals of this user research are to: 
  * Learn how users experience applying for pre-need as it relates to the addition of new fields for Integration, and determine what's working well and if pain points exist.
    * How will the new Integration fields impact users' application process?
    * Do users understand what to provide for the new fields and can they easily complete them?
    * Are users comfortable with the language for potentially sensitive new fields?
  * Determine if flow enhancements to the grouping of pages mitigate user confusion with the entering of their details.
    * Can users easily enter their details, as information is collected for up to four people/roles in the form (applicant, sponsor, preparer, previous decedents), and is it simple for them to determine in which sections of the form they need to provide these details?
    * Which areas of the pre-need application are potentially confusing for users, particularly in determining whose details they need to enter throughout?
    * Do they understand the difference between an Applicant, a Sponsor, a Previous Decedent, and a Preparer? 
* For additional integration enhancements, determine what's working well and what isn't
    * Are there additional opportunities to simplify the user experience, particularly since Integration will require the inclusion of new fields?
    * Are there any enhancements to address Corey Shea Act applicants that would be helpful?

### Outcome
This research builds knowledge implementing pre-integration to integration and will help in identifying what is working in the Integration form and if user pain points exist that we can then fully address. 

### Hypothesis
Our hypothesis is that users might: 
- Have an easier time completing the application with the improvements to the user flows and grouping of related pages
- They might experience some frustration with the addition of new required fields for integration, causing the application process to be lengthier
- Be able to more easily identify the various roles in the application and better understand what information they'll need to provide
- Deem certain parts of the form as too insensitive, and they may wonder why they have to provide that information, particularly questions centered around the death of family members and other personal demographic questions

## Methodology
Moderated usability testing with Zoom on mobile and desktop

### Location
Remote location with a preferred video conferencing software as Zoom

### Research materials
For moderated usability tests: 
- [Link to conversation guide](TBD)
- [Link to Pre-Need Pre-Integration usability testing prototype](TBD) - This prototype contains content and accessibility enhancements that we're able to implement for Integration.
	
## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
We’d like to recruit 10 participants for a total of 8 completed sessions. We’ll use Perigean to recruit participants.

### Recruitment criteria 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
- Amount: Target is 8 participants but recruit 10
- Age ranges: 
    * Around 70% 55+ - 7 participants
    * Around 20% 35+ - 2 participants
    * Around 10% 18-34 - 1 participant
- Types: 
    * Three to four service members and Veterans 

    * Two to four spouses or surviving spouses of a service member of Veteran (A **spouse** is a person who is or was legally married to a service member or Veteran. A **surviving spouse** is someone who was legally married to the service member or Veteran at the time of their death and includes a surviving spouse who remarried.)
    * One to two personal representative (a person filling out the pre-need form on behalf of an applicant, such as a **preparer**)
    * One unmarried adult child (An **unmarried adult child** is an individual who became physically or mentally disabled permanently and incapable of self-support before the age of 21, or before 23 years of age if pursuing a full-time course of instruction at an approved educational institution.)
    * One parent of a service member (not the parent of a Veteran so only applicable for parents of service members; considered a Corey Shea Act applicant)
    * Six to eight people interested in pre-need eligibility determination
    * We would like to emphasize recruiting more from the following underserved communities:
        * Identify as Biracial, Asian, Black, or LGBTQ+ 
		*Biracial - 1 participant
		*Asian - 1 participant	
		*Asian - 1 participant
		*Black - 1 participant
		*LGBTQ+ - 1 participant
    * Nice to haves:  
        * Live in rural areas or abroad
        * Other than honorable
        * Immigrant origin
        * Have cognitive disabilities 
- Participants must be able to use Zoom, locate and use the chat function in Zoom, and to share their screen through Zoom
- At least 3-4 people who will use a mobile device during the research session (tablet is ok too)
 
**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
None

**Screener questions to target criteria not captured in the recruitment sign-up survey:**
1. Are you a Veteran or a service member?
    * If yes, go to question 3. 
    * If no, go to question 2.
2. Which of the following describes your relationship to a Veteran or service member? 
    * I am their spouse or surviving spouse (A **spouse** is a person who is or was legally married to a service member or Veteran. A **surviving spouse** is someone who was legally married to the service member or Veteran at the time of their death and includes a surviving spouse who remarried.)
    * I am their unmarried adult child (An **unmarried adult child** is an individual who became physically or mentally disabled permanently and incapable of self-support before the age of 21, or before 23 years of age if pursuing a full-time course of instruction at an approved educational institution.)
    * I am their parent (only applicable for parents of service members)
    * I am their personal representative (a person filling out the pre-need form on behalf of an applicant, such as a **preparer**)
    * None of the above, but I am interested in applying for pre-need eligibility determination for myself or for someone else
3. Have you applied or tried to apply for a pre-need eligibility determination at least once in the last 12 months?  
    * If no, go to question 4.
4. Are you interested in applying for a pre-need eligibility determination for yourself or on behalf of someone else? 
    * If no, disqualify.
