# Pre-need integration release Plan Template

## Release Plan Overview

| Phase | Duration | Users | Dates |
|---|---|---|---|
|Phase 1: Staging testing |2 days|TBD| May 19, 2025 - June 13, 2025 |
|Phase 2D: 100% of users| indefinite | 100% users (auth and non-auth) |July 17, 2025|
|Phase 3: Retire V1| permanent | 100% users (auth and non-auth) | TBD |

Considerations
- Form volume is typically 80 submissions per day

## Step 1: Development

You'll need to create a feature toggle (or two) for any moderately or significantly changing feature. Follow the [best practices for creating feature toggles](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/feature-toggles).

List the features toggles here.

| Toggle name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| content-build registry.json | vagovprod: false |

## Step 2: Validation

Since we use a [continuous delivery](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/deployment-process) model, once code is in the `main` branch, it will be deployed that day. 

Before enabling your feature toggle in production, you'll need to:

- [x] Follow [best practices for QA](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/qa-and-accessibility-testing).
- [x] Have your team perform as much validation in staging as possible. Validation may be challenging for some teams and systems due to downstream requirements, but the staging system should mimic the production system as much as possible.
- [x] Work any downstream or dependant systems proactively to ensure that the feature is ready for use once it hits production.
- [ ] Have a go/no go meeting with the team to ensure that the feature is ready for use and signed off by each discipline and your DEPO/OCTO contact. During this meeting, you'll need to:
  - [ ] review the plan with your DEPO/OCTO representative.
  - [ ] review the release plan with your team.

## Step 3: Production rollout

#### Exceptions


### Define the Rollback process

- Tech lead and developers will monitor analytics along with downstream application developers. If any major concerns are identified, we will begin the roll back process by switching the vagoprod flag back to false while we investigate, and fix identified issue(s).

### Phase I: moderated production testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)

#### Planning

- Desired date range or test duration: [May 19, 2025 - June 13, 2025]
- Desired number of users: [1]
- How you'll conduct the testing: [E2E test from va.gov to end system CaMEO]
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: [NA] Will test in staging
 
#### Results

- Number of users: [FILL_IN]
- Number of bugs identified / fixed: [FILL_IN]/[FILL_IN]
  - [FILL_IN] : list
  - [FILL_IN] : of
  - [FILL_IN]: Tickets of bugs/changes
- Was any downstream service affected by the change?: yes/no, [FILL_IN]
- Types of errors logged: [FILL_IN]
- Any changes necessary based on the logs, feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? [PICK_ONE]: yes/no
- If yes, what: [FILL_IN] with ticket numbers

### Stage E: 100% of users

#### Planning

- Length of time: [FILL_IN] (*minimum 2 hours*)
- Percentage of Users (and roughly how many users do you expect this to be): 100%

#### Results

- Number of unique users: [FILL_IN]
- Metrics at this stage (per your "success criteria"): [FILL_IN] a list that includes KPIs listed in the [Rollout Planning](#rollout-planning) section
- Was any downstream service affected by the change?: [PICK_ONE]: yes | no |  N/A
- Types of errors logged: [FILL_IN]
- What changes (if any) are necessarily based on the logs, feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? [FILL_IN]

## Post Launch metrics

Continue to check in on the KPIs of your feature at periodic intervals to ensure everything is working as expected. We recommend one-week and one-month check-ins, but this is only minimal.

### 1-week results

- Number of unique users: [FILL_IN]
- Post-launch KPI 1 actual: [FILL_IN]
- Post-launch KPI 2 actual: [FILL_IN]
- Post-launch KPI 3 actual: [FILL_IN]
- Any issues with VA handling/processing?:  [PICK_ONE]: yes | no |  N/A
- Types of errors logged: [FILL_IN]
- Any changes necessary based on the logs, feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? [PICK_ONE]: yes | no |  N/A
- If yes, what: [FILL_IN]

### 1-month results

- Number of unique users: [FILL_IN]
- Post-launch KPI 1 actual: [FILL_IN]
- Post-launch KPI 2 actual: [FILL_IN]
- Post-launch KPI 3 actual: [FILL_IN]
- Any issues with VA handling/processing?: [PICK_ONE]: yes | no |  N/A
- Types of errors logged: [FILL_IN]
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? [PICK_ONE]: yes | no |  N/A
- If yes, what: [FILL_IN]

## Post-launch Questions

*To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above.*

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders?
1. Which assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated?
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
1. What technical tasks are needed to clean up (i.e., removal of feature toggles)?
