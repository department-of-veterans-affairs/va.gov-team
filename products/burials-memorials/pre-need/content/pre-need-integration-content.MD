**If you're applying on behalf of someone else** {bordered accordion}

You’ll need a copy of their sponsor’s DD214 or other separation papers. If the applicant is a service member or Veteran, you will need to provide a copy of their DD214 or other separation papers.

- The applicant’s caregiver (including a spouse or other relative), **or**
- An attorney or agent acting on behalf of the applicant under a durable power of attorney, **or**
- The manager or principal officer of an institution in which the applicant is being cared for

**If you’re applying for an unmarried adult child of a Veteran or service member,** you can upload supporting files with information about the adult child’s disability. The Veteran or guardian of the child should also ask the child’s current doctor to verify the files. These files should include the following details: 
- The date of the disability’s onset, **and**
- A description of the disability, mental or physical, **and**
- A description of how dependent the disabled child is on the Veteran, **and**
