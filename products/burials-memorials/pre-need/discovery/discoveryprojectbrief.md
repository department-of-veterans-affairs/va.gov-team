# Discovery Project Brief & Planning Template


## PROJECT BRIEF

### Project Name
Migrate Pre-Need Burial Form to Vets.gov

### Problem Statement / How Might We statements
1. Allow veterans to apply online for pre-need burial enrollment instead of mailing or faxing their applications

2. Provide some basic validatation to avoid simple mistakes (like missing digit on SSN) to speed up processing for veterans

3. Automatically submit application data into EOAS instead of that office manually inputting data

## DISCOVERY PLANNING

### Project Details

* What do we know?
* What don't we know?
* Are any of the above assumptions that need to be verified?
* How are we going to find out answers? (There are tons of different methods to choose from depending on your project goals, resources, and time constraints. Checkout the methods and templates provided in our Discovery Toolkit and consult the [Research Team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/research).)
* What kinds of users are likely to benefit from solving this problem (bonus points for our personas)?
* Who do we need to talk to (stakeholders, Veterans, MHV Coordinators, etc.)? (Try to get a wide variety of people to get a range of perspectives – both higher ups and people on the ground doing the work. Meet with people in person whenever possible.)
* What secondary research should we do (google, facebook, internal documents)?
* Are there any intentional project constraints (things we're intentionally deeming out of scope)?
* Are there any challenges or risks that will make this discovery sprint hard to complete (tricky politics, technology complications, etc.)?
