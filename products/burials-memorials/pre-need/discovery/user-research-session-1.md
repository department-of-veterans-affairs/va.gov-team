# Pre-Need User Research Session 1: Paul

## About Paul
He's 70, lives in Wisconsin, has a smart phone and laptop, seems somewhat comfortable with technology

## Conversation Guide and Response
- Have you ever considered being buried in a national cemetery?
  - I haven’t acted on it yet but i thought the veteran cemetery in X, it’s beautiful, visit it often, in King, near wappaqua WI
- Did you know that you could apply to be buried in a national cemetery at any time?
  - No, not even sure where the nearest one is to here or how you would be transported there, suppose if i was cremated they could put it in the trunk, but it would be expensive; Is King a national cemetery? Wisconsin has five veterans homes, not sure if that’s national or state - right near IL/WI border
### [Pre-Need mockup] https://marvelapp.com/i08i22g/
- Could you review this page and tell me what you think? What is confusing to you? What would you do next?
  - Not bad, could click on that to determine if you’re eligible to be buried in national cemetery, menu at the top you can drop down, looks like robert is signed in, any info he puts in would be about him, not clear he knows to scroll down, replaces a form! Eliminates paperwork, didn’t understand that breadcrums are breadcrumbs, that’s handy
- N: can you scroll?
  - P: oh yeah! Saw what to gather, liked that they told him it would take 30 days, latin under what should i do?
- N: What would you hope to see?
  - P: Don’t die before they make a decision
  - Do i scan my dd-214? 
  - He started scrolling down, didn’t see get started but he was looking for how to answer his question above, no contact to ask questions, saw contact number at the bottom, they would be able to answer his question; Would want to know how to submit dd214 first, because that’s something that’s required for approval, there must be a list of nearby cemeteries based on zip code or something; There was a link that said to apply online, trying to click the fill out the application #3, didn’t see the get started button at all
- N: what do you think would happen if you clicked the get started button? Did you notice that button? 
  - Saw it but didn’t pay attention; 20 minutes isn’t too bad, paper form would take a lot longer

### [Click Get Started]

- Is this what you expected to see?
  - Knew what this mean, clicked i am service member and continue
  - He’d put both SSN and service number
  - Seems to understand, nothing confusing

### [clicks Continue], Chapter 3 
- Can you explain what you are seeing now?
  - Desired national cemetery, would need to see his choices, he doesn’t know, Was there a link on the intro page that would give you a list based on zip? Doesn’t want to go to texas or something, ADD FL link here! 
- Do you understand how to answer all of the questions this screen asks?
  - Yes
- Are you prepared to answer these questions?
  - No 
- Is anything confusing or concerning to you?
  - no
### [clicks Continue], Chapter 4
- Can you explain what you are seeing now?
  - Page four, what happens if i apply and i happen to move? Do i need to go in and change? Do i have that option?
- N: how would you do that?
  - Hopefully at the end they’ll give me a file number or registration number so i can go back in an update, maybe at the end?

### [clicks Continue], Chapter 5, Certification - no issues

### Review: can review and correct errors, when i’m done i hit submit, x days? Send me a letter with my decision 
- Scrolled past the place where he’d review, did check the box, legalese about what happens if I lie, skim legal part, would go to jail if you lie, would check the box no matter what, he’s not lying :)

### Submitted screen
- Can you explain what you are seeing now?
  - I don’t print from my phone, would do this from my laptop so i could save it or print it, is confirmation number, then it tells me what happens after i apply
  - Add here - if you need to make change what to do, wants to know wht they look at to see if they approve, who to notify once you die 
- N: would you call that number to ask questions? 
  - After 30 days if i haven’t heard anything i’d call them and make sure they still have it, even when things are filed electronically it doesn’t always get there, would give them 35 days
  - It was fairly easy
- What happens next?
  - Get a confirmation email, add next steps to this page
  - If no email, call to make sure they got it
  - Wasn’t much different than ordering something online from a store

## Section 4
- 3 Top Takeaways
  - User will receive email confirmation when an application is submitted succesfully (or an email alert that it wasn't)
  - User can easily look up and select the cemetery that works for them
  - Add instructions to confirmation page about how to find out more information or update/change their information (call the contact center with their tracking number)
  - Discuss with Mel the instructions page - I think there might be some room here to make it clearer
  - Can we print or email the confirmation page instead of just asking them to print?
- Any github issues you think we should log?
- Any helpdesk tickets you think we should submit? No
