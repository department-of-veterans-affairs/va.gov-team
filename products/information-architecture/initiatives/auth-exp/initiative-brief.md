# Initiative Brief: Authenticated IA

#### Overview

The current IA of the modernized VA.gov benefit experience revolves around the benefit type first, then organizes content, tools, and forms within those benefits. For exploring and applying for benefits, this organizational structure generally meets the mental model of our visitors.  However, forms and tools that Veterans and family members utilize to complete tasks related to managing their benefits don't always fit within a single benefit type (i.e. claim status), and some aren't related to benefits at all (i.e. update contact information). Data and research have identified a number of challenges for visitors trying to find authenticated tools to complete their intended tasks. 

**Goals:**
- This effort is to evaluate a revised organizational structure (IA) for the authenticated tools within the Veteran and family member benefit experience that will allow visitors to more easily find the tools and succesfully complete their tasks.

**Product(s) impacted**
- Benefit hub landing pages
- Authenticated benefits tools
- My VA
- Profile
- MHV on VA.gov
- Resources and support

## Problems to solve

**Problem Defined:**
Tools, forms, and content related to managing benefits are distributed across the Veteran benefit hubs or placed at the root level of VA.gov making them hard to find, and challenging to navigate to and between tasks. 
  
**Evidence to support Problem:**

Research and analytics on the[ logged-in IA andnavigation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/research-and-analytics/2023-generative-logged-in-research/comprehensive-research-summary.md) completed in FY23 identified a number of challenges with the current organization, or, lack of a cohesive authenticated experience:
- People have a hard time navigating to things when they don’t cleanly fall into one category or topic area (e.g downloading benefit letters). 
- People get frustrated, or feel like they’re on a generic website, when personalized content isn’t surfaced while trying to complete a task
- People called out redundancies and complexities in navigation options when logged in 
- Visitors less familiar with VA.gov - i.e. My HealtheVet users or non-Veterans - have a hard time finding anything that’s not linked from the homepage or My VA. 
- People expect personalized links and content to be surfaced throughout the VA website if they are logged in
- People find it helpful, and have an increased sense of personalization, when they have access to all their tasks in one place, especially immediately after logging in.  

  
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?
  - Streamline the IA
 

## Desired User Outcomes
- As a Veteran or family member of a Veteran, I can easily
  - find tools to manage my benefits I am receiving through VA
  - navigated to tools once signed in

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Veterans and family members are unable to find the tools that allow them to manage their benefits they receive through VA


## Desired Business Outcomes
- Increased usage of authenticated tools
- Reduced calls from visitors unable to find benefit tools


## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Increased calls from visitors unable to find benefit tools

### Assumptions/Risks

**Assumptions**


**Risks**
- Development issues and broken links due to URL changes
- Loss of SEO with changes in placement, titles, and URLs
- Potential 404s
- Loss of trust from visitors if the findability of benefit information becomes more difficult
- VFS teams are unable to make changes in a timely manner creating navigational challenges with scattered tools
- Development work needed from teams outside Sitewide to support moving applications and tools


### Solution Scope

**In Scope**
- Assessing purpose and need of the tool static landing pages
- Changes to global navigation to support changes in structure and/or new authenticated space on VA.gov
- Changing the URLs and entry points of authenticated tools
- Moving pages and segments of pages from benefit hubs into Resources and support and implementing redirects as needed


**Not In Scope**
- 

  
## Approach

1. Review and synthesis of existing research and data
2. Design new IA
3. Research - TBD
4. Approach impact analysis and communication with teams
6. Implementation plan
7. Implementation


## Product/Project impacts

This work will have at least some impact to the following products and work efforts.  Continuous communication and collaboration with these teams will be established. 

Benefit hubs
- Primary contact(s): Danielle Thierry, Mikki Northuis
- Some changes to the existing benefit hub template have been proposed to better highlight key capabilities (i.e. apply now)
- Changes to user flows from static landing pages to auth tools

Benefit tools
- Primary contact(s):
- Changes in entry points and URLs of benefit tools, changes to user flows from static landing pages to tools

Health tools
