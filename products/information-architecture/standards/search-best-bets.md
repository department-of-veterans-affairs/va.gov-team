# Requesting Search Best Bets for a VA.gov Page
## Search best bets
Search “best bets” are suggested pages that appear in the “Our top recommendations for you” section when you perform a search on VA.gov. These suggestions are selected for specific terms and are intended to help veterans and their beneficiaries find relevant results quickly.

## Usage
### When to use a search best bet
- Surfacing critical content that impacts a Veteran or family member's ability to apply for, manage, or utilize their VA benefits
- Surfacing content that has a high volume of keyword searches, but is not ranking within the first page of search results
- Surfacing critical content that will impact a large number of Veterans or their family members and needs to be easy to find, such as a major legislative update, or information on a public health emergency

### When to consider something else
- **Content pertinent to a small number or sub-set of site visitors.** Content that is relative to a small audience can take away space for more critical or larger scale information, or can create confusion around information that doesn’t apply to most visitors. This includes such things as local events, internal VA information, office links, etc.
- **A page that already ranks within the first page of search results for related keywords.** Content that is already ranking high in search won’t gain much, if anything, from additional placement within the recommendations. 
- **Search volume for related keywords is very low.** If site visitors are not searching for keywords related to your content, a best bet placement will not receive many impressions.
- **Promoting a related content page.** A search best bet should not be used to promote content that is related to the keyword, but not a direct match (i.e. promoting a pension page on a disability search). Consider crosslinking within the content page and using the related content components for this.

### Behavior
- A maximum of 2 search best bets can appear on a search results page
- Search best bets are displayed based on a match of the visitors entered search term to the words in the search best bet’s title and description
   - If there are more than 2 search best bets that match the search terms entered , the 2 most relevant search best bets are displayed based on matches to the title, then description, then date.
- There can only be one search best bet per destination page
- Search best bets cannot link to external sites
- Search best bets cannot link to documents

### Content considerations
- The title (link label) must use the H1 of the destination page
- The description (supporting text)  must use the meta description of the landing page
- Additional keywords can be added to a search best bet for 
   - Words, phrases, or acronyms that are commonly entered in search queries but aren't already included in the title or description
   - Misspellings or plural variations of keywords already in the title or description that are commonly entered in search queries
