# Best Practices for IA on VA.gov

**Balance depth of structure with breadth of choice** <br>
A shallow, or flat, hierarchy makes content easier to discover by exposing it earlier in the experience - in other words, it reduces the number of clicks to drill down to detail content. This, however, needs to be balanced with the number of choices it results in for visitors. A somewhat deeper structure of 7 top level options is better than a shallow structure with 15 top level options. 


**Don't organize or structure content based on the organizational structure** <br>
Veterans and private citizens do not know which department oversees a program or benefit, and org structure is constantly changing. User-centric organization will help visitors find information and complete tasks. 


**Create user friendly URLs**<br>
URLs should be short and easy to read, as well as provide context around where the user is in the site.  URLs also provide SEO value when structure appropriately. Here are general [URL guidelines and best practices](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/information-architecture/url-guidelines.md) that we use when crafting URLs. 

**Consider all entry points and navigation paths**<br>
Most users do not enter the site on the home page, and most will not take the happy path through your experience. It is critical to consider the different ways visitors may access your information and navigate through it.  Top nav and home page links are not the answer for all features - search results, browse paths, and crosslinking are often more helpful.  

**Follow guidelines and standards for placement of content and features within the IA**<br>

Allow user insights to inform the IA
