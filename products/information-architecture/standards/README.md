### Related documentation


**VA.gov experience standards**
- [Platform Governance experience standards](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/va-gov-experience-standards) - Utilized by the Governance team, and includes core standards for nav components, content organization, URLs, user flows, etc.

**Controlled vocabularies**
- [Content briefs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/content/content-briefs) - Provides background and omni-channel direction on terminology specific to various key features and topic areas 
- [Word list](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/word-list)


### Process for establishing IA standards

1. Review the [Github table](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/information-architecture/standards) and choose an IA standard – put your name next in the POC column
2. Create a ticket in your board WITHIN the epic called: [IA Standards and Documentation](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/sitewide-content-accessibility-and-ia-63a1d63232beba0011a7833f/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/53920)
- Put a link to your ticket in the [github table](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/information-architecture/standards)
- Ticket template: [IA Standards - Homepage](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/82570#event-12734461942)
3. Write up a draft of the standard
- Make sure you find/review existing documentation
- Establish the scope
   - What are you covering
   - What are you not going to cover?
- Decide where the guidance will live - VADS vs github
4. Add a link of your draft to the [github table](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/information-architecture/standards)
5. Get standard draft approved by Mikki
- Mikki may take questions or things to OCTO
- We should remind Mikki about wrapping her task and not let it fall off
6. Untag yourself, tag Erin in your ticket
- Erin can add whatever labels they want
7. Erin confirms where the guidance should go
- If changes to existing component, may need to fill out a ticket for design council
8. Erin makes any needed edits to guidance
9. Erin publishes to wherever
10. Erin adds the link to the final standards to the github table and updates the status as COMPLETE
11. Erin writes and sends Slack announcement about change in #design



### Open questions

- Should there be an IA section within the VA.gov design system?  If so, what would it include and what would it be called?
  - IA guiding principles - or these could be incorporated into overall design principles
  - Site organization and governance
  - IA for SEO and a11y
  - Entry point considerations and guidance
  - Best bets
  - Redirects
