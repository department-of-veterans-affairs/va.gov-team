### Process for establishing IA standards

- IA identifies gap in standard or opportunity to improve documentation
  - Item is added to standards list along with info on impact and urgency in order to define priorities
- IA picks up work, does preliminary discovery on current state 
  - How is this handled today? Does documentation exist currently? What do we know about what is working well and what is not? Does this pattern exist within VADS or USWDS?
- IA works to define what the standard should be, and collaborates with Mikki and Erin to refine and finalize
- Erin works to determine where the new standard or guidance documentation should live - design system, Figma, Mural, GH, other
- Erin creates final documentation, formatted appropriately for where it will live 
- Mikki reviews with any other OCTO leads for awareness and approval as needed
- Erin publishes
