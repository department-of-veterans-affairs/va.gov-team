# VA.gov Information Architecture

Information architecture focuses on organization, labeling, and navigation of information to help people 
- Find the right information
- Understand where they are and where they can go
- Successfully complete intended tasks

## Mission of IA at VA

To ensure Veterans and their family members can easily and quickly find the right information they need to successfully complete their tasks with the least amount of friction.

We will accomplish this by:
- Designing and maintaining an organizational structure that matches the mental model of our audience
- Defining a labeling system that is understandable and consistent across all channels
- Establishing a navigation system that intuitively helps users get to and through features of the site

*Information Architecture works in strong partnership with content, design, accessibility, engineering, and product in the design, development, and implementation of the above.*

## Benefits of well-designed IA

A well-designed and maintained IA improves a visitor's experience in these ways:  
- Organizes and groups information to meet the mental model and various needs of our visitors â€“ such as by benefit, by audience, or by where they are in their journey 
- Prioritizes information to help visitors quickly understand what they most need to know without overloading them with too much detail unless or until they need it 
- Labels features (such as sections of content or digital tools) in a relevant and consistent way so visitors understand what each feature is and can recognize and find it across experiences 
- Surfaces information in multiple ways to help visitors find what they need and discover what they might not know they have access to no matter how they enter or navigate our digital experiences 
- Ensures consistent and accurate navigation elements to help visitors can easily find their way through experiences and move toward their next action 
- Creates efficient and logical pathways through information to allow visitors to successfully complete tasks 

In addition, well-organized content that utilizes clear and relevant labeling also helps
- Improve SEO 
- Meet accessibility needs 
- Reduce support calls 
- Build public trust and reputation
