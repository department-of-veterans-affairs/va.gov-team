# VA.gov Information Architecture

Information architecture focuses on organization, labeling, and navigation of information to help people 
- Find the right information
- Understand where they are and where they can go
- Successfully complete intended tasks

## Mission of IA at VA

To ensure Veterans and their family members can easily and quickly find the right information they need to successfully complete their tasks with the least amount of friction.

We will accomplish this by:
- Designing and maintaining an organizational structure that matches the mental model of our audience
- Defining a labeling system that is understandable and consistent across all channels
- Establishing a navigation system that intuitively helps users get to and through features of the site

*Information Architecture works in strong partnership with content, design, accessibility, engineering, and product in the design, development, and implementation of the above.*

## Benefits of well-designed IA

Good IA can help improve a visitor's experience by
- **Organizing and grouping information** in ways that meet the mental model and various needs of our visitors – i.e. by benefit, by audience, or by their journey
- **Prioritizing information** to help visitors quickly understand what’s available and avoid overloading them with too much information 
- **Labeling features in a relevant, concise, and consistent way** so visitors understand what something is and can recognize and find it across channels
- **Surfacing information multiple ways** to help with findability and discoverability
- **Ensuring consistent and accurate navigation** elements to help with wayfinding and forward progression
- **Creating efficient and logical pathways** to and through information – accounting for the various ways a visitor can enter and exit your content and feature

In addition, well-organized content that utilizes clear and relevant labeling also helps
- Improve SEO 
- Meet accessibility needs 
- Reduce support calls 
- Build public trust and reputation 


## Key Principles in Information Architecture

1. Objects - Create a flexible and adaptable IA to accomodate content and information that evolves over time. 
2. Choices - Limit options and choices to reduce cognitive load and help visitors make easy and informed decisions by keeping options focused and relevant. 
3. Disclosure - Gradually reveal information and allow visitors to explore more detailed information at their own pace to create a more engaging and understandable experience.
4. Exemplars - Provide context and information to help visitors understand the contents within a category or section and help them to better navigate and discover relevant information.
5. Front doors - Ensure every page provides a sense of place within the site to allow visitors entering on any page to orient themselves.
6. Multiple classifications - Offer multiple ways for visitors to find and access information in order to meet various mental models and help them easily find the information they need.
7. Focused navigation - Define a clear and simple purpose to navigation menus to ensure visitors understand the types of information it leads to.
8. Growth - Design a flexible structure that allows for growth of new content and functionality over time.

## IA Principles at VA (DRAFT)

1. Always provide a sense of place. Utilize design components and content to ensure visitors know where they are within the experience and where they can go next.
2. Provide a consistent omnichannel experience.  Organizational structure and labeling should be as consistent as possible between different touchpoints - digital and physical.  
3. Provide time-sensitive and urgent information at the right time and place without creating urgency.  Prioritize information to ensure information is easy to find at time of need and information critical to the safety and well-being of visitors is quickly accessible.
4. Present information in the right place and in the right way to meet the needs of visitors in the context in which they need it.  Visitors arrive at a VA digital experience with a range of situations and needs that impact how they look for and understand the information. 
5. Provide simple and focused pathways to and through information to reduce cogntive load, friction, and burden.  Learning about, applying for, and managing benefits often involves time-consuming and complex information and task flows.  
6. Ensure every page and feature provides value and a call to action.
