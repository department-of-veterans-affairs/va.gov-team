# Search Best Bet Evaluation and Implementation Process
## Using Search.gov
Search "best bets" are implemented in Search.gov by the IA team and consist of the page title, description and any keywords. Keywords are vetted words or phrases that aren't already in the title or description.

## Guidelines
### IA and implementation
- Choose a maximum of two keywords
- Use Google Analytics, Domo, or Google Trends to identify words that people use to search for the content
- Prioritize content that’s related to veterans and their beneficiaries
- Each page must have different content (no duplicates or identical pages)
   - Best bets on a single term should be distinctly different content
- Links must be internal only
- Avoid linking to documents or files because they have poor accessibility
- Keywords must be specific and directly related to the content that's being promoted
   - Avoid keywords that are too broad or that can have multiple meanings
     - Such as counseling or benefits
   - Don't use keywords that exceed 255 characters
   - Insert appropriate accent marks for translation work
     - Such as español
- Implement content and recommendations directly into Search.gov

### Content
- The link label in the best bet should utilize the page H1
- The teaser text in the best bet should utilize the meta description of the page

## Process
1. Request comes in from Randi to complete any of the following tasks in Search.gov:
   - add keywords for specific page(s) on Va.gov
   - update the current keywords for specific page(s) on Va.gov
   - update links and content for specific page(s) on Va.gov
2. Confirm with the requesting team when the requested page will be live, if applicable
3. Coordinate with the Content team as they will provide page H1 and metadescription for pages that haven’t been published yet
4. For pages that are live on the site, update the URL, title, and/or the description directly in Search.gov.
   - If the current metadescription is over the 255 character max, coordinate with the Content team to review and provide feedback on how it could be shortened to fit the character limits.
5. Review any relevant research, if applicable
6. Validate any current keywords against [IA and implementation guidelines](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/process/search-best-bets-process.md#ia-and-implementation)
7. Review any additional keywords that have been requested or that should be added to Search.gov
8. Use metric tools to evaluate performance and inform keywords list
9. Follow up in original request ticket with findings and recommendations
10. Implement any changes into Search.gov
