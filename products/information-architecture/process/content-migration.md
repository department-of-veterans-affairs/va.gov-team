## IA responsibities in content migration

Content migration efforts are primarily led by the content team members.  However, IA plays an important role in this effort to ensure new content pages are properly structured and placed within the modernized site, redirects are properly handled, and recommendations are given to the business line to ensure the legacy area of the site is not left in pieces.

### IA responsibilities
- Participate in kick-off meeting to understand scope of work, timing, and stakeholder relationships
  - Inform stakeholder of IA's role in process:  Establish URLs and entry points for any new benefit hub pages, mapping and validating redirects, and providing recommendations for TeamSite modifications post migration
- Review and understand the audit and content placement decisions
  - Work with content team if there are differing opinions on content placement decisions as they pertain to the benefit hubs
- Map out and document redirects
  - Review with content team, create redirect tickets and manage through process, communicate redirects to stakeholders 
- Audit the legacy site left nav and document recommendations
  -   Document left nav options and indicate which options are moving over to the modernized experience and which are staying
  -   Identify any child pages that are left behind (i.e. sometimes a parent page is migrated but a child page is not - that has to be carefully accounted for in redirects, as well as ensuring that visitors can still navigate to the page)
  -   Draft recommendations for updates to the TeamSite experience
      -   Indicate which navigation options should be eliminated, updated, or newly created
      -   Indicate if new pages should be created
- Send recommendations for TeamSite changes to stakeholders
  - In some cases, a walkthrough with the stakeholder may be necessary
