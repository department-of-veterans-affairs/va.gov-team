## IA responsibities in content migration

Content migration efforts are primarily led by the content team members.  However, IA plays an important role in this effort to ensure new content pages are properly structured and placed within the modernized site, redirects are properly handled, and recommendations are given to the business line to ensure the legacy area of the site is not left in pieces. See more info about how IA is involved on the [Content team migration process page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/content-strategy-ia-collaboration/continued-content-migration-strategy/benefits.va.gov/migration-process.md)
