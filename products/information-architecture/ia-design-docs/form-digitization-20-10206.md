## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
*Illustration and/or description of how users will flow through the experience. The user flow helps illustrate how visitors will navigate to and through your product/feature, ensures all types of visitors and scenarios are accounted for, and aids in identifying all content and messaging needs.*

Team has created user flows in [this Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1694111229625/784141f7f136fcd481b4010e5ec0ca961434e5fe?sender=u79ee90295fdb006d7f463212). We added feedback under the user flows as well as added stickies directly on the flow. Those stickies represent feedback based on the [VA experience standards](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/va-gov-experience-standards).

| Category | Standard | This product |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | 
User flows | A user flow has valid or appropriate closure, and doesn't result in a dead end where a user can't complete a task due to a functional issue (i.e. blank page, missing field or CTA, 404 error). | Already on Content's radar but want to confirm there’s info on the last page so folks have context what one can expect after submitting |
User flows | A user flow provides content or navigation to help users understand where to go or what to do next. | Include content on the intro page for verifying identity to 1) let folks know they are going to a new page and 2) how to return to this page. Team has implemented this!
User flows | A user flow includes a prominently placed CTA that doesn't lead the user out of the primary flow without notifying them or providing a clear way for them to return to the original flow. | Same as above, include content on the intro page for verifying identity to 1) let folks know they are going to a new page and 2) how to return to this page. I’m curious about what happens if the verification process isn’t successful. What can be done to support this flow? |
User flows | Your content or feature supports all necessary user flows and scenarios. | At this moment, the POA/third party flow isn't being supported in the digital flow. The team has added content on the intro page so that audience is directed to submit by paper form. I added sticky for non-citizen flow to include screen where folks can enter A number |

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*



## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*


**1) H1 of page - New**
- URL: 
- Breadcrumb: VA.gov home > Records >  H1 of page
- Notes: Subsequent pages will add on to the above URL using short and simple labels, i.e. .../introduction/. We can provide further guidance on these additions if needed. Let us know if there’s any other questions on the POA/third party URLs as well.


## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
*A list of new internal entry points, as well as changes to any existing entry points. This list focuses on the primary entry points and does not include all possible crosslinking opportunities. Consider whether a Search Best Bet might be useful if this product enhances a Top Task for veterans.*

This is a list of proposed entry points. We recommend checking page performance after the online application has been 100% launched and then submitting a ticket to have IA reeavuluate entry points if needed.

1. **[Records hub page](https://www.va.gov/records/)** - Add
  - Placement description: Under “Get your records and documents”, 4th option down. Below the records options that are currently available on the modernized site.

2. **Records left nav** - Add
  - Placement description: Under “Get your records and documents”, 3rd option down. Below the records options that are currently available on the modernized site. Get Veteran IDs is 3rd down on the moment and so left nav order is off by 1.

## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
*A list of any critical redirects needed as part of this product/feature launch. Redirects are required for any URL changes to ensure visitors do not receive a 404 - Page not found error in the experience. For any redirects listed, please submit a request for the redirect using the [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=jennymayoco%2C+kristinoletmuskat%2C+strelichl%2C+FranECross&labels=sitewide+CAIA%2C+Sitewide+IA%2C+Public+Websites%2C+VA.gov+frontend%2C+Redirect+request&projects=&template=redirect-request.md&title=Redirect+Request) at least 2 weeks in advance.*  

[Form VA3288](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-3288) is being replaced by this form, but isn’t currently in the digitizing forms pipeline and hasn’t been updated since 2020. We recommend submitting a redirect to this form so folks are taken to the new digital form 10206 once the team receives confirmation on next steps for VA3288.
 

## <a name="bestbets"></a>Best Bets <br>
*Search “best bets” are suggested pages that appear in the “Our top recommendations for you” section when you perform a search on VA.gov. These suggestions are selected for specific terms and are intended to help veterans and their beneficiaries find relevant results quickly. We want to make sure that best bets are not linking to the deprecated page.*

Think it might be helpful to have best bets!
