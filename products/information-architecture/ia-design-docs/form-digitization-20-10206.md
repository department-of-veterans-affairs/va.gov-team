# IA Design for Privacy Act Form 20-10206
**STATUS: Completed**

**Team:** Veteran facing forms

**IA Request:** [Link to Sitewide Content and IA intake request #65348](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/65348)

**On this page:**
- [User/page flows](#flows)
- [Page structure](#map)
- [URLs and breadcrumbs](#url)
- [Entry points](#nav)
- [Redirects](#redirects)
- [Best Bets](#bestbets)


## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
*Illustration and/or description of how users will flow through the experience. The user flow helps illustrate how visitors will navigate to and through your product/feature, ensures all types of visitors and scenarios are accounted for, and aids in identifying all content and messaging needs.*

Team has created user flows in [this Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1694111229625/784141f7f136fcd481b4010e5ec0ca961434e5fe?sender=u79ee90295fdb006d7f463212). We added feedback under the user flows as well as added stickies directly on the flow. Those stickies represent feedback based on the [VA experience standards](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/va-gov-experience-standards).

FYI, no flow for POA/third party is supported at this moment.

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*


**1) H1 of page - New**
- URL: www.va.gov/records/request-personal-records-form-20-10206
- Breadcrumb: VA.gov home > Records >  H1 of page
- Notes: In addition, subsequent pages will add on to the above URL using short and simple labels, i.e. .../introduction/. We can provide further guidance on these additions if needed.


## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
*A list of new internal entry points, as well as changes to any existing entry points. This list focuses on the primary entry points and does not include all possible crosslinking opportunities. Consider whether a Search Best Bet might be useful if this product enhances a Top Task for veterans.*

This is a list of proposed entry points. We recommend checking page performance after the online application has been 100% launched and then submitting a ticket to have IA reeavuluate entry points if needed.

1. **[Records hub page](https://www.va.gov/records/)** - Add
  - Placement description: Under “Get your records and documents”, 4th option down. Below the records options that are currently available on the modernized site.
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: www.va.gov/records/request-personal-records-form-20-10206
  - Notes: When folks click on the link from the hub page, it'll take them directly to `/introduction` page of the form flow

2. **Records left nav** - Add
  - Placement description: Under “Get your records and documents”, 4th option down. Below the records options that are currently available on the modernized site. Get Veteran IDs is 3rd down at the moment but we can update the left nav so it matches the hubpage order.
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: www.va.gov/records/request-personal-records-form-20-10206
  - Notes: We can update the left nav order so that when the new online form is published, it should be the 4th option and match the order in the hubpage. When folks click on the link from the left nav, it'll take them directly to `/introduction` page of the form flow

## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
*A list of any critical redirects needed as part of this product/feature launch. Redirects are required for any URL changes to ensure visitors do not receive a 404 - Page not found error in the experience. For any redirects listed, please submit a request for the redirect using the [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=jennymayoco%2C+kristinoletmuskat%2C+strelichl%2C+FranECross&labels=sitewide+CAIA%2C+Sitewide+IA%2C+Public+Websites%2C+VA.gov+frontend%2C+Redirect+request&projects=&template=redirect-request.md&title=Redirect+Request) at least 2 weeks in advance.*  

Our understanding is that [Form VA3288](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-3288) is being replaced by 20-10206, but isn’t currently in the digitizing forms pipeline and hasn’t been updated since 2020. We recommend that if the team gets next steps for Form VA3288 and it's a form that is being taken down, to connect with CAIA to plan out stakeholder outreach and identify whether this page could be redirected.

## <a name="bestbets"></a>Best Bets <br>
*Search “best bets” are suggested pages that appear in the “Our top recommendations for you” section when you perform a search on VA.gov. These suggestions are selected for specific terms and are intended to help veterans and their beneficiaries find relevant results quickly. We want to make sure that best bets are not linking to the deprecated page.*

Think it might be helpful to have best bets! Happy to connect on this once online form has been published and we can set up a best bet ticket or feel free to [submit one to CAIA]([url](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=jennymayoco&labels=sitewide+content%2C+sitewide+CAIA%2C+Sitewide+IA&projects=&template=Best+Bet+Request.md&title=Best+bet+request+for+%3Ctopic%3E)https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=jennymayoco&labels=sitewide+content%2C+sitewide+CAIA%2C+Sitewide+IA&projects=&template=Best+Bet+Request.md&title=Best+bet+request+for+%3Ctopic%3E).
