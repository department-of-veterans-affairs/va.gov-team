**STATUS: [In progress]**

**Note on Process: *Once the team has finalized H1s and URLs please let CAIA know.* We'll do a final check to confirmation that they don't create confusion or conflicts with features in the Veteran and Family Member spaces.**

## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
Flow into forms, including a new supporting page. The same pattern applies to both forms.

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
- The 85/15 reporting form and the 35% exemption form should live under the [Resources for schools](https://www.va.gov/school-administrators/) page. 
- Please create a supporting page for each form, to hold reporting requirements and instructions about the submission process. The current design uses the About page for this purpose. About pages are part of the Find a VA Forms search tool, and their primary purpose is to provide a short description, and links to the PDF and digital versions of the form. They are not intended to hold a lot of detail on requirements or processes. The workflow, sitemap, and suggested urls in this spec provide info for creating a supporting page and for each form.
- With an additional supporting page of information and instructions for each form, the sitemap would look like this. The level 2 pages are the proposed additional pages.

## <a name="H1 and URL"></a>H1 and URL<br>

Refer to the design system's guidance for [page titles and section titles](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/page-titles-and-section-titles), [URLs](https://design.va.gov/components/url-standards/), and [title tags](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/title-tags) when finalizing the form pages' H1s and URLs.

**Some suggestions:**

**85/15 Rule, supporting page** - New
- **H1:** 85/15 Rule enrollment ratios
- **URL:** va.gov/school-administrators/85-15-rule-enrollment-ratios/

**85/15 Rule, form** - New
- **H1:** Report 85/15 Rule enrollment ratios
- **URL:** va.gov/school-administrators/85-15-rule-enrollment-ratio/report-ratios/
  
**35% Exemption, supporting page** - New
- **H1:** 35% exemption from 85/15 reporting
- **URL:** va.gov/school-administrators/35-percent-exemption/

**35% Exemption, form** - New
- **H1:** Request 35% exemption from 85/15 reporting
- **URL:** va.gov/school-administrators/35-percent-exemption/request-exemption/
  
*Note on Terminology: The term '85/15 Rule' is recommended instead of the term '85% Rule', because it occurs more frequently in web and in the VA's own supporting documentation*

*Note on Form Numbers: Veterans often know forms they use frequently by form number. So we often include the form number in H1s and URLs. If the form numbers are often referenced by this audience, the form number could be appended to the end of each URL.  For example "va.gov/school-administrators/85-15-rule-enrollment-ratio/report-ratios-form-22-10205/".*


## <a name="entry-points"></a>Entry Points<br>

### Primary entry points
_The primary entry points are required to be in place for staging review._

**1) Supporting Pages** - Add
- The 85/15 Rule supporting page must have a link to the 'Report 85/15 Rule enrollment rations' form
- The 35% Exemption supporting page must have a link to the 'Request 35% exemption from 85/15 reporting' form


### Secondary entry points

**2) About Page** - Add
- Once forms 22-10215 and 22-10216 are live, please reach out to CAIA to add links from the corresponding "About form" pages to the online versions of the forms.

**3) Resources for Schools Page** - Add
- There should be links and descriptions on the [Resources for schools page](https://www.va.gov/school-administrators/), to:
  - the new 85/15 Rule supporting page
  - the new 35% Exemption supporting page
- Note: These are entry points to the supporting pages which contain the reporting requirements and instructions about the submission process. Not entry points directly to the forms.


## <a name="recirects"></a>Redirects<br>

Redirects are not needed, since pages are only being added (not moved or replaced).
