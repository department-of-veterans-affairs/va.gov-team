## <a name="non-veteran-experience-url"></a>URL and title guidance - USE IF BUILT OUTSIDE THE VETERAN-FACING EXPERIENCE
*General guidance for URLs and page titles.  It is not required, but it is suggested that teams follow established standards and guidance documented in the [VA Design System](https://design.va.gov/).*
*Related standards: [URLs](https://design.va.gov/components/url-standards/), [H1s (Page titles and section titles)](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/page-titles-and-section-titles), [Breadcrumbs](https://design.va.gov/components/breadcrumbs), [Title tags](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/title-tags)*

The following suggestions and guidance are provided to help you determine your final URLs and page titles. Only the main page of your experience/feature - typically the top or parent page - is provided. Beyond this top level page, you can create additional supporting pages as needed for your feature.  

1) [Page name/description] **COPY AS NEEDED**
- General guidance and rationale
  - *Example: Although your forms supports the application process, its intended audience is not those that are applying.  For this reason we recommend avoid using forms of the word "apply" and the benefit name when possible to ensure the page does not conflict with the Veteran apply content in search results.  The goal is to focus on the specific task and terminology used for this audience.*
  - *Example: Even though your form title includes the phrase "85% Rule", search data shows that individuals are often searching for the term "85/15 rule". For this reason we suggest using that in your page title, and your URL.  Keep in mind that special characters cannot be used in URLs, so this would translate to "85-15-rule" when included in a URL slug.*
  - *Example: Consider how familiar your audience is with the form number.  For Veterans, we often include the form number in the page titles and URLs to improve findability. An example of this pattern can be seen with this [disability compensation application](https://www.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/).* 


## <a name="veteran-experience-url"></a>URL, H1, title tag, and breadcrumb guidance - USE IF BUILT WITHIN THE VETERAN-FACING EXPERIENCE
*H1 and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. Teams must follow established standards as documented in the [VA Design System](https://design.va.gov/).*
*Related standards: [URLs](https://design.va.gov/components/url-standards/), [H1s (Page titles and section titles)](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/page-titles-and-section-titles), [Breadcrumbs](https://design.va.gov/components/breadcrumbs), [Title tags](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/title-tags)*

The following URLs, H1s, and breadcrumbs are final.  If any changes are needed to these elements, please work with IA to review and finalize. 

1) [Page name/description] **COPY AS NEEDED**
- URL:
- H1: 
- Breadcrumb: 
  - Per standards for the breadcrumb component, the breadcrumb must match the IA of the page and current page segment must exactly match the H1 of the current page. Your breadcrumb should look like:
  - VA.gov home > [Insert page hierarchy]
- Title tag:
  - Per standards for title tags, the initial section of the title tag should match the H1 of the current page presented in initial caps formatting. Your title tag should look like:
  - [Insert Page H1] | Veterans Affairs
- Notes: 



## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points supported by centralized content and IA team <br>
*Entry points are the main CTAs provided in navigation or page content that provide access for users to your feature or content page.*

The centralized content and IA team will support you in implementing entry points that live within the Veteran and beneficiary experience of VA.gov.  These entry points are listed below and will be implemented after your feature is live to 100% of users. 

1) Placement: [Name/description of placment] **COPY AS NEEDED**
- Description: 
- Where this will link to:
- Notes:


## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects
*Redirects should be implemented when a page is moved or archived to ensure visitors do not receive a "404 - Page not found" error.*

The product team is responsible for identifying, requesting, and implementing any redirects. 

The standard process for redirects can be found on the Platform website. Please note that ALL redirects require you to submit a [Redirect Request Issue](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?template=redirect-request.md) to be reviewed and approved before implementing. Please submit at least 2 weeks in advance.*
