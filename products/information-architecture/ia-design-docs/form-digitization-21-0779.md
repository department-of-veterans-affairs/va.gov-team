**STATUS: Draft**

**Team:** Veteran facing forms

**IA Request:** [Sitewide Content and IA intake request #61548](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/61548)

**On this page:**
- [User/page flows](#flows)

- [Entry points](#nav)
- [Redirects](#redirects)
- [Best Bets](#bestbets)


## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
*Illustration and/or description of how users will flow through the experience. The user flow helps illustrate how visitors will navigate to and through your product/feature, ensures all types of visitors and scenarios are accounted for, and aids in identifying all content and messaging needs.*

[Team’s user flows](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1689263867031/247dd849a52d919107ee618358f3723dadf4b673?sender=u289d767e8810fcc3bc4e9135)

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

[Proposed page form can live in](https://www.va.gov/pension/aid-attendance-housebound/) - will update with screenshot of site map once URL is finalized.


## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*


**1) H1 of page - New**
- URL:
- Breadcrumb: VA.gov home > Pension benefits > Aid and Attendance benefits and Housebound allowance > H1 of page
- Notes: Subsequent pages will add on to the above URL using short and simple labels, i.e. .../introduction/. We can provide further guidance on these additions if needed.

## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
*A list of new internal entry points, as well as changes to any existing entry points. This list focuses on the primary entry points and does not include all possible crosslinking opportunities. Consider whether a Search Best Bet might be useful if this product enhances a Top Task for veterans.*

## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
*A list of any critical redirects needed as part of this product/feature launch. Redirects are required for any URL changes to ensure visitors do not receive a 404 - Page not found error in the experience. For any redirects listed, please submit a request for the redirect using the [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=jennymayoco%2C+kristinoletmuskat%2C+strelichl%2C+FranECross&labels=sitewide+CAIA%2C+Sitewide+IA%2C+Public+Websites%2C+VA.gov+frontend%2C+Redirect+request&projects=&template=redirect-request.md&title=Redirect+Request) at least 2 weeks in advance.*  

Not needed.

## <a name="bestbets"></a>Best Bets <br>
*Search “best bets” are suggested pages that appear in the “Our top recommendations for you” section when you perform a search on VA.gov. These suggestions are selected for specific terms and are intended to help veterans and their beneficiaries find relevant results quickly. We want to make sure that best bets are not linking to the deprecated page.*

Already an existing best bet, but it links to the [About form page](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-0779/), which we don't typically add best bets to. The current keywords are:
- 21-0779
- form 21-0779
- va 21-0779
- va form 21-0779

We recommend updating best bets once page is live so that folks are directed to the online form. Once page is live, connect with IA in Slack or feel free to submit a [best bet request](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=jennymayoco&labels=sitewide+content%2C+sitewide+CAIA%2C+Sitewide+IA&projects=&template=Best+Bet+Request.md&title=Best+bet+request+for+%3Ctopic%3E).
