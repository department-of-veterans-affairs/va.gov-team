- [Redirects](#redirects)
- [Best bets](#search)
- [Meeting notes](#notes)


## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
*Illustration and/or description of how users will flow through the experience. The user flow helps illustrate how visitors will navigate to and through your product/feature, ensures all types of visitors and scenarios are accounted for, and aids in identifying all content and messaging needs.*

The team outlined their flows for the reactivation step in [this Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1695069026901/50b83f710f1cd2f1f7f3bb63553c349ef90d402a?wid=0-1695076685174)

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*



## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

No IA recommendations to form flow URLs or breadcrumbs at this moment. Recommending updating base URL so it is up to date with standards. Team confirmed that a URL update can be slated for the next version as the MVP relaunch date is set for January 2024 and not within scope at this moment.

Proposed URL: www.va.gov/pension/apply-for-veteran-pension-form-21p-527ez

## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
*A list of new internal entry points, as well as changes to any existing entry points. This list focuses on the primary entry points and does not include all possible crosslinking opportunities.*

The team laid out the entry points in [this Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1695069026901/50b83f710f1cd2f1f7f3bb63553c349ef90d402a?sender=u79ee90295fdb006d7f463212) and so we are finalizing these in the IA spec. These are pages where the link to the form are being reinstated.

## <a name="search"></a>Best bets <br>
We previously routed best bets searches to the [About VA Form 21P-527EZ](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21p-527ez/) page so that folks wouldn't get search results to the form flow. We recommend updating best bets so that search results direct to the [online form](https://www.va.gov/pension/application/527EZ/introduction) again. Once form is reactivated, feel free to submit a [best bet ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/Best%20Bet%20Request.md) or ping me in Slack and we can create the ticket and implement the best bet updates.
