Notes:
- The family member benefit hub - where CHAMPVA content and features live - is structured differently than the Veteran benefit hubs. The key difference is that the Veteran hubs have hard-coded groupings for "Get benefits" and "Manage benefits" which divides content and features based on needs before applying and after applying.
- These groupings do not exist in the family hub, and the family hub has very little "Manage benfits" content or features, so that structure is not planned for that space at this time. 
- Therefore, in the family member benefit hub, content and features related to getting benefits and managing benefits will both be nested under the primary benefit content page.
