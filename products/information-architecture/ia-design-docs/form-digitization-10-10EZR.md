## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
*Illustration and/or description of how users will flow through the experience. The user flow helps illustrate how visitors will navigate to and through your product/feature, ensures all types of visitors and scenarios are accounted for, and aids in identifying all content and messaging needs.*

Team's user flows (with a focus on flow A) can be found in [this Sketch file](https://www.sketch.com/s/912cab8e-d234-44dd-be1f-2bedb3f50b22/v/vbDovn/p/A0C657F6-3318-45A0-93CB-246BA8722E37/canvas?posX=-4725.9800734093715&posY=-13249.90512643657&zoom=0.1252390295267105)
## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*



## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*
