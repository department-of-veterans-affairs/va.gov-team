## <a name="flows"></a>User/Page Flows <br>
*Description of how users will flow through the experience*

- Users will access this tool via a link in text message.  
  - Users will not be able to navigate to this via VA.gov.
  - This tool will not be available via VA.gov or external search.
- A display state must be included to accomodate users who attempt to bookmark and/or directly access the URLs in the check-in flow

## <a name="ia"></a>URLs and Breadcrumbs <br>


**Page** | **URL** | **Breadcrumb** | **Description**
--- | --- | --- | ---

Note: If you come back to us with all of the pages in the flow, we can help you create url slugs. Otherwise, here is the [guidance on how to create them yourself](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/url-standards). The TL;DR is Each one should be 1-2 words max, and have keywords from the H1s.

If you want to create the urls yourself (recommended so you are super familiar with them), we're happy to review them.

Here are some ideas:

## <a name="nav"></a>Navigation and Entry Points <br>
The text message from VEText is the only entry point to this demographics and checkin workflow.


## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
We don't think we need to implement redirects at this time, but double-check with your devs that that makes sense to them!

Question for Ben: What happens today when a user clicks on an old/expired link?
