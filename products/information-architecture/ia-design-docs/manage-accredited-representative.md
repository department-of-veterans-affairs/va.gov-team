## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
![ARM Page structure](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/122126772/9f751ec0-8244-4eb1-9650-81c561782398)

The up-to-date page structure can be viewed in [mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1692888741111/2474c0612887653142ab991d234898b6968dbf0e?wid=0-1697145057961).

The new tool will live under ROOT since it supports all benefit types. 
- It will have a tool landing page with it’s own URL - va.gov/**get-help-from-accredited-representative**
- The 'find a rep' tool will have it's own URL under the landing page - va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/**find-rep**
- The pages within the flow (blue stickies above) may change depending on what steps the team decides to include. The team can change those ‘step’ urls themselves, but try to make them plain language!
- The landing page MVP will only include the 'find a rep' tool, but once we add the 'appoint a rep' tool, it will live as a separate url under the landing page. Ex: va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/**appoint-rep**


## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
**1) R+S Page - New**
- URL: TBD depending on H1 that content lands on. We do not have to determine the URL -- URLs on R+S pages are autogenerated based on the H1.
- Breadcrumb: Home > Resources and support > [H1 TBD by content]
- Notes:  We will migrate the existing disability page content (found on va.gov/disability/get-help-filing-claim) to resources and support, because the information applies to all benefits, not just disability. The entry points in the disability left nav and hub pages will remain, they will just need to be edited in Drupal to point to the new landing page url (instead of the new R+S url).

**2) Accredited Rep Landing Page - NEW**
- URL: va.gov/**get-help-from-accredited-representative**
- Breadcrumb: Home > [Match H1 exactly]
- Notes: This is the unauth landing page for the tool, similar to this one for claim status tool: https://www.va.gov/claim-or-appeal-status/

**3) Find a rep Base URL - NEW**
- URL: va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/**find-rep**
- Breadcrumb:  Home > [H1 of accredted rep landing page] > [H1 of find a rep tool]

**4) Appoint a rep Base URL - NEW**
- URL: va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/**appoint-rep**
- Breadcrumb:  Home > [H1 of accredted rep landing page] > [H1 of appoint a rep tool]


## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
- For the MVP, the main entry points of the tool are: the existing left nav/hub links from disability and decision reviews.
- Aside from that, there are MANY crosslinking opportunities across va.gov. These opportunities are fleshed out in this [mural here](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1692888741111/2474c0612887653142ab991d234898b6968dbf0e?wid=3-1696370591178). All of these different entry points will point to the accredited rep landing page.
- Closer to implementation, the content team will work to update the relevant entry points with updated link labels and urls.
- [Detailed entry point plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wxue2bQWHXY2fUGTTvRE-WKOUSJkUvUN5avpCooImc0/edit)

![lots of entry points](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/122126772/97e06e7c-abff-4192-89c0-05873ef50615)

Additionally, we identified a need for entry points potentially in the Profile (where a veteran may go to view current rep), and MyVA (where they might see an application for appointing a rep in progress). 

![User journey with 'view my current rep' task](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/122126772/f146286a-70ae-4baf-af60-bb45097684d4)

Note: the accredited rep team thinks that the current entry point plan wont provide enough access for veterans due to 2 factors: 1) 70% of claims are submitted w/ accredited rep support, which is an overwhelming majority that might need this tool [Source](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representation-management/research/claims-with-representatives-analytics.xlsx) and 2) In a previous study that relied on existing navigation, only 1/10 veterans were able to find the accredited rep info [Source](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ebenefits/view-update-POA/research-design/Research-finding-power-of-attorney-and-payment-history.md). Given the demonstrated need and the nav study failure, they think we should bump these pages up. 

Here was our IA response:
- 1. The main menu and homepage are super political pages — there’s a lot of stakeholder review that we have to go through to add anything to those, so in general we want to be 100% sure that it belongs there.
- 2. The typical process for new tools is to wait 3-6 months after launch to 100% of users to evaluate traffic and then determine whether the page needs to be bumped up in nav hierarchy, which we can totally do.
- 3. One way to think about the navs, is that the left nav contains all of the pages in a hub. The hub page contains the top 10 pages by traffic in each spoke (get, manage, and more). And then the mega menu contains the top 5 pages in ‘get’ and ‘manage’.
- 4. The fact that users are failing the nav research is important, but if 70% of claims have an accredited rep, it also means users are finding those capabilities successfully.
- 5. So in summary, **we think we should go with the above entry point plan, and then in the 3-6 months reevaluate traffic to determine if we want to move the pages up**.

## <a name="bestbets"></a>Best Bets
Search “best bets” are suggested pages that appear in the “Our top recommendations for you” section when you perform a search on VA.gov. These suggestions are selected for specific terms and are intended to help veterans and their beneficiaries find relevant results quickly. We want to make sure that best bets are not linking to the deprecated page.

There are currently 4 best bets set up around this project. The two at the top are already primed for change in our search.gov database, we just need the go-ahead of publish them.
