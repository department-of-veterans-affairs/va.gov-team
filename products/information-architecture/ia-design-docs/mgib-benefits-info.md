 # IA Design for Manage Your Benefits page within MGIB VYE tool
**STATUS: In progress**

**Team:** VYE

**IA Request:** [Link to Sitewide Content and IA intake request](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/82157)

**On this page:**
- [User/page flows](#flows)
- [Page structure](#map)
- [URLs and breadcrumbs](#url)
- [Entry points](#nav)
- [Redirects](#redirects)
- Best Bets
- [Staged Rollout](#stagedrollout)


## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
*Illustration and/or description of how users will flow through the experience. The user flow helps illustrate how visitors will navigate to and through your product/feature, ensures all types of visitors and scenarios are accounted for, and aids in identifying all content and messaging needs.*


## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

This page will live on the same level as verifying enrollments page.

## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site. This section will also document form or tool flow URLs, titled sub-URLs.*


**1) H1 of page - New**
- URL: www.va.gov/education/verify-school-enrollment/mgib-enrollments/benefits-information/
- Breadcrumb: VA.gov home > Education and training > H1 of page (`/mgib-enrollments page`) > H1 of page
- Notes: This page will live within the MGIB Verify your Enrollment tool, but will eventually be integrated into the global va.gov Profile. Ensure breadcrumb matches H1.

## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
*A list of new internal entry points, as well as changes to any existing entry points. This list focuses on the primary entry points and does not include all possible crosslinking opportunities. Consider whether a Search Best Bet might be useful if this product enhances a Top Task for veterans.*


1. **VYE for MGIB benefits** - Add
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: www.va.gov/education/verify-school-enrollment/mgib-enrollments/benefits-information/
  - Notes: This will be the home for this in the meantime

### Note for the crosslinks below:
We'll want to distinguish the global va.gov Profile from the info that will only be used to manage MGIB benefits. Work closely with Sitewide Content to make this clear to Veterans, something along the lines of "updating your info in this tool will not change the info in VA.gov Profile." I defer to Sitewide Content on what that would look like!

2. **[VA.gov Profile](https://www.va.gov/profile)** - Add
  - Placement description:
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: www.va.gov/education/verify-school-enrollment/mgib-enrollments/benefits-information/
  - Notes: Work with both Auth team and Sitewide Content for where and how to include info
-------

3. **[Change your address in your VA.gov profile](https://www.va.gov/change-address/)** - Add
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: www.va.gov/education/verify-school-enrollment/mgib-enrollments/benefits-information/

## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
*A list of any critical redirects needed as part of this product/feature launch. Redirects are required for any URL changes to ensure visitors do not receive a 404 - Page not found error in the experience. For any redirects listed, please submit a request for the redirect using the [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=jennymayoco%2C+kristinoletmuskat%2C+strelichl%2C+FranECross&labels=sitewide+CAIA%2C+Sitewide+IA%2C+Public+Websites%2C+VA.gov+frontend%2C+Redirect+request&projects=&template=redirect-request.md&title=Redirect+Request) at least 2 weeks in advance.*  


Current URL | Redirect to | Notes
--- | --- | ---
 |  | 

 No redirects needed at this time, but I think we can touch base as we get closer to the integration into Profile so we can connect on what will happen to this page.

## <a name="stagedrollout"></a>Staged Rollout<br>
*Is the team planning a staged rollout? Pages/sections that can't have a widget: find a form pages, within accordions, hub pages*

**[Which static page has the widget, ie the main entry point?]**
