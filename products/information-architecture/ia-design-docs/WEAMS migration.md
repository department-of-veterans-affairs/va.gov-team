## <a name="ruidelines"></a>Guidelines for IA within the Comparison Tool<br>
On this project, CAIA IA support will be focused on the connections between the Comparison Tool and the rest of va.gov. We are not able to support IA and Content decisions within the tool Landing page or sub-pages. Please reference the following guidelines for design/content/IA decisions inside the tool:
- All content, data, new functionality, and child pages holding WEAMS data must be built on, or as sub-pages of, the current Comparison Tool parent url of https://www.va.gov/education/gi-bill-comparison-tool.
- How sub-pages under that parent URL are structured is up to the product team.
- Follow VADS standards for all [URLs](https://design.va.gov/components/url-standards/), [breadcrumbs](https://design.va.gov/components/breadcrumbs), [page titles](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/page-titles-and-section-titles).
- Every page created must have a clear entry point - a way for visitors to navigate to the page through links and navigation components. Pages cannot be reachable only via search.
- Key SEO elements - page titles and intro text - should be differentiated from other pages in the Education hub. For example, do not create a sub-page of the comparison tool named "Education benefits management".
  

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map).*

Up-to-date diagrams can be found on [Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1729183095781/13879f018516bd9dd354f278919b5a9c101a0f1f?wid=136-1729183109815).

All data and flows migrated into the Comparison Tool must be located at the current https://www.va.gov/education/gi-bill-comparison-tool or on sub-pages of that URL. The new 'Landing page' will be placed at the existing URL, and the School Comparison will be moved to a sub-page. The new Licensing & Certification data and National Test data will also each have a sub-page.

## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site. This section will also document form or tool flow URLs, titled sub-URLs.*


**1) GI Bill Comparison Tool - Existing URL, will hold a different screen**
- URL: va.gov/education/gi-bill-comparison-tool
- Breadcrumb: VA.gov home > Education and training  > GI Bill Comparison Tool
- Notes: This URL currently holds the first screen in the Compare Schools search workflow. This same URL should now be used for the new 'landing page' screen. The H1 may be updated to reflect the added information in the tool.

**2) School Comparison search - Existing screen at a new URL**
- URL: va.gov/education/gi-bill-comparison-tool/[TBD by product team]
- Breadcrumb: VA.gov home > Education and training  > GI Bill Comparison Tool > [TBD by product team]
- Notes: This will be the current start screen of the School Comparision tool search flow. It will be moved down one level in the sitemap heirarchy, and will have a new URL and breadcrumb showing it a sub-page of va.gov/education/gi-bill-comparison-tool

**3) Licensing & Certification search - new**
- URL: va.gov/education/gi-bill-comparison-tool/[TBD by product team]
- Breadcrumb: VA.gov home > Education and training  > GI Bill Comparison Tool > [TBD by product team]
- Notes: New page, for the start of a new search flow. It should be a sub-page of va.gov/education/gi-bill-comparison-tool

**4) National Tests data list - new**
- URL: va.gov/education/gi-bill-comparison-tool/[TBD by product team]
- Breadcrumb: VA.gov home > Education and training  > GI Bill Comparison Tool > [TBD by product team]
- Notes: New page holding list data. It should be a sub-page of va.gov/education/gi-bill-comparison-tool

### Secondary entry points

## <a name="launchstuff"></a>Launch coordination activities <br>

### Redirects
*A list of any critical redirects needed as part of this product/feature launch. Redirects are required for any URL changes to ensure visitors do not receive a 404 - Page not found error in the experience. Redirects listed are the responsibility of the product team, please submit a [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?template=redirect-request.md) at least 2 weeks in advance, so that CAIA IA can verify that the redirects are successful on launch.*  

- Who implements the redirect: EDM team
- When does the redirect go live: After launch

Current URL | Redirect to | Notes
--- | --- | ---
 va.gov/education/gi-bill-comparison-tool/search= | va.gov/education/gi-bill-comparison-tool/[TBD school comparison search] | Set up a redirect that sends former search result URLs to either the new landing page, or the first screen of the School Comparison search flow. This supports users who have previously bookmarked search results.


### Best bets
*Search “best bets” are suggested pages that appear in the “Our top recommendations for you” section when you perform a search on VA.gov.*

**1. GI Bill School Comparison Tool - Modify best bet**  
CAIA IA will update the current Best Bet, and add description and/or keywords that highlight that National Tests and Licensing & Certification data is now available in the Comparison Tool.
- Who implements the redirect: CAIA IA
