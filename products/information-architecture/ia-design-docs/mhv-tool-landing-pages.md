- [URLs and breadcrumbs](#url)
- [Entry points](#nav)
- [Redirets](#redirects)
- [Search best bets](#bestbets)


## <a name="flows"></a>Navigation flows <br>
*Illustration and/or description of how users will navigate to and flow through the experience for all impacted visitors typies. This helps identify key entry points and findability requirements, user flow scenarios, and content/messaging needs across various scenarios.*

Notes:
- The Medications and Messaging products both have landing pages in the auth tool.  Those landing pages will be eliminated and all content will be moved to R&S.
- The only direct/deep links to the MHV on VA.gov portal landing page and tools will be on the Health care benefit hub tool landing pages.  All other links across the site will link to those tool landing pages first to prompt sign in.
- This work will result in all links to MHV tools on VA.gov pointing at the VA.gov version.
- This flow does not represent the flows for external deep links (i.e. bookmarks) directly to the portal landing page or the tools. That flow is documented within the sign in/MHV portal routing documentation. This only represents general flows through uanuth content to the portal.

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

Notes:
- The "View your VA lab and test results" page will be merged with the "Get your VA medical records" page.
- A new page for the MHV on VA.gov portal landing page will be added.
- Pages within this section of the hub will be reordered based on 1) the portal landing page first 2) page view of the main 4 portal tools and 3) page views of the remaining health tools 4) page views of any additional pages/crosslinks.
- The sitemap shown does not reflect final page titles.

## <a name="url"></a>Page URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site. This section will also document form or tool flow URLs, titled sub-URLs.*
