## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
*Illustration and/or description of how users will flow through the experience. The user flow helps illustrate how visitors will navigate to and through your product/feature, ensures all types of visitors and scenarios are accounted for, and aids in identifying all content and messaging needs.*

- Visitors will be able to access individual forms directly from various pages or via external links, or they may access the landing page and select the needed from there.
- The landing page and intro page will include any necessary supporting content or provide a link to a R&S page for any deeper supporting content.
- Form intro pages may have links to most relevant hub or R&S pages, but won't have links to all entry points. Visitors will need to use their browser back button to return to the page they came from if it is not listed.  
- Success pages will have have 1 or more exit links appropriate to that form. Those exit links may or may not be similar to the entry point links provided on the intro page.

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*


**1) Supporting Forms page - New**
- URL: www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/
- Breadcrumb: VA.gov home > [H1 of page]
- Notes: 
  - Will include name, link to pdf, and link to online form
  - May also indicate if the form is available as part of another online form flow (i.e part of the 526) so Veterans are aware if they completed the online 526 they may have already submitted it)
  - Will also include supporting content such as purpose of the form, related benefits, and who can/should complete it
  - Page does not need a left nav, visitors can access the specific form they need from the content on the page
  - Page should include a breadcrumb so the visitor can return to this page from a form to review other forms available.  
 
2) Each form that lives in this section will be defined independently


## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
*A list of new internal entry points, as well as changes to any existing entry points. This list focuses on the primary entry points and does not include all possible crosslinking opportunities. Consider whether a Search Best Bet might be useful if this product enhances a Top Task for veterans.*

**Entry points for specific forms will be contextual, and placed within forms and pages where appropriate and as needed.** 

**Entry points for the supporting forms landing page are as follows:**

**1) [Disability hub](https://www.va.gov/disability/)**
- Add to [How to file page](https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/) - add to the "More information about filing disability claims" section at the bottom of the page
- ~Remove "Additional forms" option from left nav under How to file a claim~
- ~Update link destination for "File additional forms" option in left nav under Manage benefits to point to new page~

**2) [Disability > How to file > Additional forms page](https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/additional-forms/)
- Add link to the supporting form landing page in a new section for related links at the bottom of the page

3. **[The VA claim process after you file your claim](https://www.va.gov/disability/after-you-file-claim/)** - Add
  - Placement description: Add under "More information about disability ratings and payments" section
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/
  - Notes: We are adding this link in the disability hub as a general way to look for supporting forms rather than crosslinking specific forms. This was kicked off after exploring crosslinking opportunities for form 20-10207. We will be adding a link to the supporting forms page both under "how to apply" pages and "after you apply". We want to follow a pattern where the supporting form page is listed lower under "more info" on "how to apply" pages and higher under "more info" section on "after you apply" pages. As noted above, the ["how to file a VA disability claim" page](https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/) already has a link to supporting forms page under "More information about filing disability claims", but will want to update the description.

## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>

Update 6/12/23:  We will not be redirection the existing Additional forms page in Disability.  Instead, we will maintain this page for now where it is and make the following updates: 
- Remove the following from the table: the 4142, adaptive housing links, A&A links, dependents link
- Add a related section to the bottom that includes links to the new supporting forms page, adaptive housing, A&A, dependents

## <a name="notes"></a>Meetings notes and background info
6/12/23 - Discussion w/Danielle
- Discussed 3 groups of "supporting/additional forms": Ones you file as part of your 526 claim that are specific to disability, ones you file as part of the claim process for multiple claim types, and ones you file after your 526 for additional benefits, and ones you can file 
- The existing additional forms page in disability includes all 3 of these, plus includes related benefits - sometimes the main application (i.e. adaptive housing) and sometimes supporting forms for another benefits (a couple A&A forms). Beyond those it has both forms you file as part of your 526 (i.e. PTSD) and forms you file after your 526 for additional benefits.  All of these forms are also linked to from within the Eligibility child pages for PTSD and special claims.  We do not believe this is an all-inclusive list. 
- This work is focused on creating a space for the forms that support multiple benefit types - the supporting forms page.  We do not anticipate this page having a lot of SEO value or being a primary destination, it is primarily a means to group the benefit-agnostic forms.  It is a temporary solution that will be re-evaluated.
- We discussed future work around the disability additional forms page moving to R&S, and becoming a link list for a more exhaustive list of forms to file with your 526.  We could have similar R&S pages for other benefits.  Those would tell the full story of forms for specific benefits, and would link out to the homes of those forms.
