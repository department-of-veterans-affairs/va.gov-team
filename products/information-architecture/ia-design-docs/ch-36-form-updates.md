## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
*A list of any critical redirects needed as part of this product/feature launch. Redirects are required for any URL changes to ensure visitors do not receive a 404 - Page not found error in the experience. For any redirects listed, please submit a request for the redirect using the [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=jennymayoco%2C+kristinoletmuskat%2C+strelichl%2C+FranECross&labels=sitewide+CAIA%2C+Sitewide+IA%2C+Public+Websites%2C+VA.gov+frontend%2C+Redirect+request&projects=&template=redirect-request.md&title=Redirect+Request) at least 2 weeks in advance.*  

The form number was updated from 25-8832 to 27-8832. CAIA has updated the URL to reflect this and created a redirect request.

## <a name="bestbets"></a>Best Bets<br>
*Search “best bets” are suggested pages that appear in the “Our top recommendations for you” section when you perform a search on VA.gov. These suggestions are selected for specific terms and are intended to help veterans and their beneficiaries find relevant results quickly. We want to make sure that best bets are not linking to the deprecated page.*

We also updated the past best bet with the new URL and H1 so it is the top result and will review on 6/14/24 to see if needs to extended.

## <a name="stagedrollout"></a>Staged Rollout<br>
*Is the team planning a staged rollout? Pages/sections that can't have a widget: find a form pages, within accordions, hub pages*

**[Which static page has the widget, ie the main entry point?]**
