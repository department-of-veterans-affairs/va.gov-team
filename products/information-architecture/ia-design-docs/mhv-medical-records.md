## <a name="launch-plan"></a>Medical Records launch plan<br>
Medical Records has several subdomains that will be launching incrementally to Phase 0 throughout Fall 2023. The proposed launch order is as follows: 
1. Allergies (October 2023)
2. Vaccines (fast follow 2-3 weeks later)
3. Health Conditions, Vitals
4. Care summaries & notes
5. Lab and test results

## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
Most up-to-date user flow can be found on VA public mural: https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1671138122441/c6eae887e8c0467e616d61002f14085580dfb59c?wid=0-1686659937807

Background notes:
- If you've been treated at a VA health facility at any point for any thing, you would have something for a Blue Button report, regardless of whether you are currently enrolled in VA healthcare.
- BUT, it's possible you had VA healthcare so long ago that it isn't showing up. Still working out user scenarios of who gets to see what past Phase 0 when we open up to more users.
- Veterans enrolled in Foreign Medical Program who had VA healthcare in the past might need to access records here (note: still determining if they are included in user base)
- Also not sure what CHAMPVA users have access too yet (TBD).
- Healthcare records from during military service CANNOT be found here.
- Veterans might go to /health-history by accident looking for medical records, so we should add a way for them to recover from that error and get in the right place (Once we reach Phase 1). 

Open questions:
1. If a user doesn't have data to show, will they not have it for all the reports, or could it just be for one report?
   **Answer**: If the user doesn't have data for that particular domain, they can still view data in other domains. We have an informational alert for pages that explains why the page is empty.
2. Does VHIE apply to ppl who never got VA healthcare? If so, do we still want to show it to them?
   **Answer**: VHIE will not apply to people who have never had healthcare.
3. Users will most likely need help figuring out how to share the VA Health Summary with their provider. What's the right spot to give them that guidance?
   **Answer**: We aren't including the VA Health Summary (at least in Phase 0)
4. How can we make the experience seamless for Veterans who come here from the unauth pages? How can we ensure the content isn't duplicative or contradictory?

## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs

**Note: Full traditional breadcrumbs (if used) will need to be suppressed until the "My health" landing page fully live (to 100% of users) to avoid having an inactive segment in the breadcrumb.**

## <a name="nav"></a>Secondary navigation <br>

* Phase 0 initial launch (Allergies only) will not have a secondary navigation. Navigation will only be exposed once 2+ subdomains are launched. 

* Full phase 0 secondary/left navigation order:

  - Medical Records
    - Lab and test results
    - Care summaries and notes
    - Vaccines
    - Allergies
    - Health conditions
    - Vitals
    - Medical records settings
    - Download all records

## <a name="notes"></a>Meetings notes and background info

Open issues:
- identify phase when entry points should be implemented
  - In phase 0, the user will only be linked from a url in an email invite to the VA Medical Records landing page
  - In phase 1, the email invites will stop. Users will be linked from legacy MHV directly to these pages via "try me out" messaging. 
  - In phase 2, the landing page will be removed from Medical Records (and that content will be migrated over to a Resources + Support page on VA.gov)
  - Other changes to the left nav are pending user research and syncing with other MHV tools.
- identify where existing medical records and lab and test results link on My VA links to
  - ![Destination of medical recrods link on va.gov](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122126772/227366022-7095ff05-a69f-421c-b919-ea67b42ffde3.png)
- identify what changes are needed to health care hub, including the existing "get medical records" page and "lab an tests results" page
  - Currently, we have a static page for lab and tests and for getting medical records, but not for health history. 
  - Do we need to broaden page to include access to lab and tests as well as health history, or do we keep individual pages (health history page does not exist)
  - Pull analytics and SEO data on existing pages and keywords for reference
- redirects
  - timing is based on different phases
  - need to identify who will redirect myhealth.va.gov URLs
- User flow changes 
  - can we bypass the static page for authenticated users?
