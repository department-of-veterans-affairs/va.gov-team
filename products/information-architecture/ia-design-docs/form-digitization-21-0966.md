## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>


## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of how users will flow through the experience. The user flow helps illustrate how visitors will navigate to and through your product/feature, ensures all types of visitors and scenarios are accounted for, and aids in identifying all content and messaging needs.*

The form will live under the new parent page for supporting forms. Sitemap has also been updated to reflect that the supporting forms page is now live.

## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

**1) H1 of page - New**
- URL: www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/intent-to-file-form-21-0966
- Breadcrumb: VA.gov home > Supporting forms for VA claims > H1 of form page
- Notes: Subsequent pages will add on to the above URL using short and simple labels, i.e. .../introduction/. We can provide further guidance on these additions if needed.


## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
*A list of new internal entry points, as well as changes to any existing entry points. This list focuses on the primary entry points and does not include all possible crosslinking opportunities.*

1. **[Supporting forms page](https://www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/)** - Add
  - Placement description: ~~5th option down~~ 1st option on the page
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/intent-to-file-form-21-0966
  - Notes: As of 1/24/24, forms will be ordered based on submission data for online application / PDF occurrences for newer forms added. As such, this form will be moving up as the first option as it's the most commonly used.

2. **[Your intent to file a VA claim](https://www.va.gov/resources/your-intent-to-file-a-va-claim/)** - Add
  - Placement description: Under "How do I notify VA of my intent to file?" section
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/intent-to-file-form-21-0966
  - Notes:

3. **[How to apply for a VA pension as a Veteran](https://www.va.gov/pension/how-to-apply/)** - Add
  - Placement description: Currently, the form is mentioned in the "You can't use our online application right now" section
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/intent-to-file-form-21-0966
  - Notes: The pension form is currently down and so the intent to file form is mentioned in a gray box that will be removed once the form is relaunched, which will be in January 2024. We recommend working with Katherine Fung for when pension form is relaunched and the intent to file placement may move. She is the main point of contact for Content updates for this form.

## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
