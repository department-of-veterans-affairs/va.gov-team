# IA Design for Medical Supply re-order form
**STATUS: Redesign in progress**

**Team:** There isn't really a team dedicated to supply re-ordering. It's a combination of Cartography team (engineering) + OCTO Fellows Jasmine Yohannan (Product) & Jenny Wang (Design). 

**What's changed:** The supply re-order form is scaling to support additional supplies for medical devices beyond just hearing aids and CPAP machines. Since the literal name of the form was scoped to those two things previously, several changes needed to be made: form name change, H1 changes, URL changes, unauth page updates, and addition of more radio buttons to handle the additional supplies. 

**URL update:**
* Old URL: va.gov/health-care/order-hearing-aid-batteries-and-accessories
* New URL: va.gov/my-health/order-medical-supplies

The form is broadening to cover additional medical supplies, but is also shrinking its sitemap. Updated sitemap is below:

## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
There are two possible entry points to this form: 
1. The My HealtheVet landing page at https://www.va.gov/my-health - this URL requires several validation checks for access
  * check 1: must be signed-in
  * check 2: must be ID-verified
  * check 3: must have at least one VA facility listed in the user's profile
2. The health care hub page for supply re-ordering at https://www.va.gov/health-care/order-medical-supplies - this URL has one less access check. This page can be accessed many ways: search engine, site search, side navigation/secondary nav, and primary mega menu nav. 
  * check 1: Signed-in
  * check 2: ID-verified
  * _this page does not check for a facility in the user's profile, the form itself will need to check for that and route-guard users to the /my-health landing page if a facility is not present. Users will see an appropriate warning alert in-place on the landing page telling users that they do not have access to My HealtheVet._

## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
It appears there is an empty directory at `va.gov/my-health/order-medical-supplies` - this needs to be redirected to the `/introduction` page (included in table below).
