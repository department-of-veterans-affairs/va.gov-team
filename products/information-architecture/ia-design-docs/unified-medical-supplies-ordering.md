## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
![User flow to finding medical device ordering](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/122126772/cff5ed82-6737-4777-8b61-63b1f9fb6e81)


## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
Our future state will put all medical device ordering info under one drupal static page for unauth users. The single page will point to the CPAP/hearing aids ordering form AND the prosthetic socks order form on eBenefits.
