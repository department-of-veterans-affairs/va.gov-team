## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
Users will get to police data for individual facilities from the VAMC system-level VA Police page in the ‘About’ left nav. They’ll use the dropdown to select the facility and year they want data for.

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs

**1) VAMC VA Police data summary page - New**
- URL: va.gov/[vamc-system]-health-care/va-police/
- Breadcrumb:  [vamc system] health care > VA Police
- Notes: each URL will be customized according to the VAMC system name



## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>

1. **Left Nav** - Add
  - Placement description: For the MVP, add VA Police as the last item in the ‘About [vamc system’ section of the left nav. 
  - Link label: VA Police 
  - Link destination: va.gov/[vamc-system]-health-care/va-police/
  - Notes: Reordering the ‘about’ section of the left nav is part of a separate ticket – we’ll do it later, and not part of this mvp.
 

## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
No redirects. There is a separate process for deprecating old VA Police pages – no redirect needed.


## <a name="bestbets"></a>Best Bets <br>
There are currently no best bets for ‘police’ on va.gov. I don’t think we need to set them up for these facilities, since we would have to set up a separate one for each facilities, and we don’t currently have any best bets set up for facilities.
