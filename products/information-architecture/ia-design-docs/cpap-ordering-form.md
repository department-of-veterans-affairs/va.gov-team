We placed the order form at the same hierarchy as the static pages for CPAP and hearing aids since it's for both types of supply -- it wouldn't make sense to link it under just one or the other.


## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
**1) [Order CPAP Supplies] - [New]**
- URL: va.gov/health-care/order-cpap-supplies
- Breadcrumb: Home > Healthcare > Order CPAP supplies

## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
1. **[Left Nav]** - [Add]
  - Placement description: In ‘Manage Benefits’ between ‘Order hearing aid batteries and accessories’ and ‘Order prosthetic socks’
  - Link label: Order CPAP Supplies
  - Link destination: va.gov/health-care/order-cpap-supplies
