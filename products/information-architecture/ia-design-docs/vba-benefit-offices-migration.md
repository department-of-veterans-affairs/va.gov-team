# IA Design for VBA Regional Benefit Offices
**STATUS: Complete**

**Team:** Sitewide facilities - Dave Pickett

**IA Request:** [64934](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/64934)

**On this page:**
- [Naming structure](#map)
- [URLs and breadcrumbs](#url)
- [Entry points](#nav)
- [Redirects](#redirects)



## <a name="map"></a>Naming structure<br>
The guide to naming structure is maintained by the facilities team [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/facilities/naming-schema#vba-benefits-facilities-naming-schema).


## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs

**1) Benefit Offices URL Strucure - New**
- URL: va.gov/[based on H1 and naming structure mentioned above)
- Breadcrumb: Home > [H1 of page]
- Notes: We usually don't include a breadcrumb if we only have 2 layers. But we're going to do it here to prepare for adding events as a sub-page in the future. And the team asked whether we could put these pages under a sub-directory (ex: va.gov/benefit-offices/H1). We decided not to so that the structure matches Vet Centers, and so we don't have empty directories.



## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
Entry points are not changing -- the main entry point is the 'Find a Location' tool. A secondary entry point is in the 'Other nearby VA locations' section of a VAMC health system. For example: https://www.va.gov/cheyenne-health-care/locations/


## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
- From Dave: The engineers on the team have very strong opinions about redirects and what the source of truth should be
- They’re just launching to 7 sites right now and working on the national rollout later – we can leave this as in-progress and update it later as needed
