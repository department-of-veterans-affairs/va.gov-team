## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
*Illustration and/or description of how users will flow through the experience. The user flow helps illustrate how visitors will navigate to and through your product/feature, ensures all types of visitors and scenarios are accounted for, and aids in identifying all content and messaging needs.*


## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*



## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site. This section will also document form or tool flow URLs, titled sub-URLs.*

### Navigation pathways and entry point for launch
See more about [navigation pathways and entry points](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/process/entry-points.md). Teams must launch with at least one navigation pathway.

**1) Add/Modify/Remove Page/menu name**
- Placement description: 
- Link label: 
- Link destination: 
- Notes:

### Secondary entry points
_Any additional locations that the page should be navigable from such as the "About a form" page, additional navigation component (top, left) placements, additional static pages where its prominently linked from, etc.   These are secondary, and while they are still very important, are not required for launch._

**1. Add/Modify/Remove page/menu name** - 
- Placement description: 
- Link label:
- Link destination: 
- Notes:

### Crosslinks
_Not required. Links in content or in related links sections of other pages that point to this feature. This includes places where an existing crosslink may need to be updated. This section is not intended to capture every crosslinking placement, it is only to capture placements identified during the IA design process for reference.  Crosslinks are primarily identified by the content team and stakeholders.  The content team will be responsible for finding all existing referring links that may need to be updated._

**1. Add/Modify/Remove link on a specific page** - 
- Placement description: 
- Link label:
- Link destination: 
- Notes: 

## <a name="launchstuff"></a>Launch coordination activities <br>

### Redirects
*A list of any critical redirects needed as part of this product/feature launch. Redirects are required for any URL changes to ensure visitors do not receive a 404 - Page not found error in the experience. For any redirects listed, please submit a request for the redirect using the [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=jennymayoco%2C+kristinoletmuskat%2C+strelichl%2C+FranECross&labels=sitewide+CAIA%2C+Sitewide+IA%2C+Public+Websites%2C+VA.gov+frontend%2C+Redirect+request&projects=&template=redirect-request.md&title=Redirect+Request) at least 2 weeks in advance.*

### Best bets
*Search “best bets” are suggested pages that appear in the “Our top recommendations for you” section when you perform a search on VA.gov. Best bets are not implemented for every page, and not intended to be permanent.  They can aid in helping visitors find content and features that are not easily found or not ranking well in search. Existing best bets must be removed or updated when links/URLs change.*

**1. Add/Modify/Remove Page name best bet** - 
- Title: [H1 of page]
- Link:
- Description: [Meta description of page]
- Additional keywords *(Misspellings or phrases that are not an exact match to the title or description)*
  - [keyword]



### Staged rollout
*Is the team planning a staged rollout? Roll-outs hidden behind a flipper flag need a static page to place a sign in widget or CTA on. Pages/sections where a sign in widget can't be implemented - find a form pages, within accordions, hub pages*

Which static page has the widget, ie the main entry point?
