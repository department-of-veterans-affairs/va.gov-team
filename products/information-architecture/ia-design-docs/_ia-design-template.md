## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
*Illustration and/or description of how users will flow through the experience. The user flow helps illustrate how visitors will navigate to and through your product/feature, ensures all types of visitors and scenarios are accounted for, and aids in identifying all content and messaging needs.*


## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*



## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site. This section will also document form or tool flow URLs, titled sub-URLs.*

### Sub-URLs

## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>

### Primary entry point
_Most of the time this is the CTA on a tool static landing page (a sign in widget).  For forms, it may be on a How to apply page or equivalent. Sometimes the only way to access a feature is via navigation component (top, left) or a header/footer/home page link. This is the only entry point that HAS to be ready to launch when a team goes through staging review._

1. **[Page/menu name]** - [Add/Modify/Remove]
  - Placement description: 
  - Link label: 
  - Link destination: 
  - Notes:

### Secondary entry points
_Any additional locations that the page should be navigable from.  This is often an about-a-form page, an R&S page about the feature, or can be left nav or mega menu.   These are secondary, and while they are still very important, are not required for launch._

1. **[Page/menu name]** - [Add/Modify/Remove]
  - Placement description: 
  - Link label:
  - Link destination: 
  - Notes:

### Crosslinks
_Not required. Links on other pages that point to this tool/thing/form._

1. **[Link on a specific page]** - [Add/Modify/Remove]
  - Placement description: 
  - Link label:
  - Link destination: 
  - Notes: 
 

## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
*A list of any critical redirects needed as part of this product/feature launch. Redirects are required for any URL changes to ensure visitors do not receive a 404 - Page not found error in the experience. For any redirects listed, please submit a request for the redirect using the [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=jennymayoco%2C+kristinoletmuskat%2C+strelichl%2C+FranECross&labels=sitewide+CAIA%2C+Sitewide+IA%2C+Public+Websites%2C+VA.gov+frontend%2C+Redirect+request&projects=&template=redirect-request.md&title=Redirect+Request) at least 2 weeks in advance.*

## <a name="bestbets"></a>Best Bets<br>
*Search “best bets” are suggested pages that appear in the “Our top recommendations for you” section when you perform a search on VA.gov. These suggestions are selected for specific terms and are intended to help veterans and their beneficiaries find relevant results quickly. We want to make sure that best bets are not linking to the deprecated page.*

## <a name="stagedrollout"></a>Staged Rollout<br>
*Is the team planning a staged rollout? Pages/sections that can't have a widget: find a form pages, within accordions, hub pages*
