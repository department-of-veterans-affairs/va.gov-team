## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>

### Primary entry point
_Most of the time this is the CTA on a tool static landing page (a sign in widget).  For forms, it may be on a How to apply page or equivalent. Sometimes the only way to access a feature is via navigation component (top, left) or a header/footer/home page link. This is the only entry point that HAS to be ready to launch when a team goes through staging review._
