## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
*Illustration and/or description of how users will flow through the experience. The user flow helps illustrate how visitors will navigate to and through your product/feature, ensures all types of visitors and scenarios are accounted for, and aids in identifying all content and messaging needs.*


## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*


**1) Medical decision review - NEW**
- URL: TBD
- Breadcrumb: Home > Decision reviews and appeals > [H1]
- Notes: 

**2) Caregiver claims - NEW**
- URL: TBD
- Breadcrumb: Home > Decision reviews and appeals > [H1]
- Notes: 

**3) After you request a decision review - MODIFY**
- URL: https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/after-you-request-review/
- Breadcrumb: Home > Decision reviews and appeals > After you request a review 
- Notes: This page will be moved form the "Request" spoke to the "More resources" spoke.  This change only impacts the entry points to the page (outlined below), and does not impact the URL, breadcrumb, or structure of the page.  

## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
*A list of new internal entry points, as well as changes to any existing entry points. This list focuses on the primary entry points and does not include all possible crosslinking opportunities. Consider whether a Search Best Bet might be useful if this product enhances a Top Task for veterans.*

## <a name="notes"></a>Meetings notes and background info
6/12/23 - discussion w/Danielle
- Initial request from VHA was to create an entire hub of health care and medical decision reviews; We have communicated that we cannot create a second decision reviews hub that repeats all of the information and need to bring them together.  The original DR hub was very much focused on VBA and did not include feedback from VHA. 
- For this initial phase our goal is to incorporate the health information into the existing decision reviews hub with minimal structural changes to the existing DR hub
- Decisions
  - Create a new medical decision review option page that will be equivalent to the supplemental claim/high-level review/board appeal pages - it's a 4th type of DR
  - Add a page about Caregiver decision reviews similar to the life insurance, contested claims, insurance pages - it is another special case that utilizes the 4 options
    - If time allows, the existing LI, contested, and fiduciary pages will be simplified by removing the content that is duplicative to the main 3 DR options, and instead just link to them
  - Update the "Choosing a decision reivew option" R&S page to focus on 1) is it a benefit or a health care claim  2) if benefit, these are your options  3) if health care link, is it health benefits or medical
