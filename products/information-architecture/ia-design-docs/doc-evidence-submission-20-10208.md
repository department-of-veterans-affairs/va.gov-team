**1. [Add to Supporting forms for VA claims](https://www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/)**
- The new form will be second on the page, because it’s in numerical sequence and related to with 10210. 
- Content Note: make sure the user can differentiate between 10210 and 10208 use cases.

**2. Modify content on [Upload supporting evidence](https://www.va.gov/disability/upload-supporting-evidence/)**

3. Letter in the mail requesting more information?
- Content Note: I’m not sure if this is in our control, but we should make sure that any requests that reference this form point to the right online places.
