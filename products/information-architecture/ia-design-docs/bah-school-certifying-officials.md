# IA Review and Recommendations

**Team:** Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH)

**Product/Featue:** School Certifying Officials content

**Background/Context:**
BAH conducted research on School Certifying Officials content, and found that “SCOs want and need VA resources to do their work effectively, but find it challenging to access information on the VA website.” As part of the team’s efforts to improve the usability and findability of SCO content, it has been decided that the content will be migrated to the modernized VA.gov.

**Review Date:** November 5, 2019

**IA Review Issue:** https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/3041

The content proposed for migration is not Veteran-facing benefit content and therefore categorized as "Tier 2" content. Currently there are no templates/content/design standards for Tier 2 content, and the migration will be done prior to a designed approach to tier 2 content is complete. 
The recomendations below are based on current va.gov standards and potential approach to tier 2 content in relation to tier 1 content.

### IA and URL 

**Structure:**   
- This content will not live with the Education hub content - it is not Veteran-facing benefit content. 
- It will live separately as a "persona" or "audience" hub at the root level of va.gov
- The goal is to create a generalized URL for this audience.

**URLs:**
- http://www.va.gov/school-administrators

- The content already includes some content that is not specific to the title of "School Certifying Officials", and this URL/label direction allows the content to continue to expand to any content related to a broader administrators audience. 
- This also avoids using proper nouns, or position titles/labels that may evolve over time.
- The H1 does not need to match this exactly and can incorporate specific terms, i.e. "VA Resources for School Administrators and SCOs"


### Navigation/Entry Points

**Primary**

- From the Education Hub (www.va.gov/education) - the current link in the right rail of the hub page will remain. The label can be updated to "School Administrators & SCOs" for consistency.
- From the legacy Education & Training site - the BAH team will work with appropriate Team Site contacts to change the left nav to reduce it to one option labeled "School Administrators & SCOs". Consider dropping the "For" in front of the navigation label. The option "For Students" will likely change over time as well, or change be changed with this to drop the "For".

**Crosslinking**
- No additional crosslinking recomendations at this time. 

### Redirects/Canonical 
*Identify if any redirect or canonical tags are needed.  This is not intended to be a complete and final list of redirect needs, but directional information only.*  

- Redirects of the legacy pages should be done once this new content is launched. 
- BAH will document legacy pages that need to be retired/redirected and indicate where they should redirect to - looks like 3 pages to be redirected to this new URL.
- BAH can work with stakeholders to help communicate the movement of this content to the new URL so that other content owners start to link to the correct page.
