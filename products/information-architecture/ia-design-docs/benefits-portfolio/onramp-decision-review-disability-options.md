## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>

Teams must launch with at least one entry point that allows site visitors to navigate to the new content or feature. 

**Please note:** The Governance Team requires preview links of updated entry points as a part of staging review in the Collaboration Cycle. It may be a launch-blocking issue. Updates that will be done by the Content and IA team, as noted below, should be requested a minimum of one week before the staging review cutoff (four days prior to scheduled review). Two weeks of advanced knowledge is preferred when possible. Please communicate the staging review date as soon as it is scheduled to your main Content and IA contact.
