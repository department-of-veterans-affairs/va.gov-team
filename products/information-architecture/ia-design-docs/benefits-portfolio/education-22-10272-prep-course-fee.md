## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>

Teams must launch with at least one entry point that allows site visitors to navigate to the new content or feature. 

**Please note:** The Governance Team requires preview links of updated entry points as a part of staging review in the Collaboration Cycle. It may be a launch-blocking issue. Updates that will be done by the Content and IA team, as noted below, should be requested a minimum of one week before the staging review cutoff (four days prior to scheduled review). Two weeks of advanced knowledge is preferred when possible. Please communicate the staging review date as soon as it is scheduled to your main Content and IA contact. 

### Required entry point(s)

1. **Licensing or certification test prep course reimbursement (VA Form 22-10272)**
  - Entry page URL: va.gov/forms/22-10272/
  - Placement description: Add a link to the form as appropriate
  - Link details
    - Link label: TBD by content
    - Link destination: va.gov/forms/22-10272/request-prep-course-reimbursement-online/
  - Notes:
    - Who will update: Content will add the link
    - When will this entry point go live: at launch
    - **Note: If the form will be released incrementally (aka not at 100%) or if the launch plan includes taking the form down temporarily after launch to check submission quality, a widget will be required. This requires coordination between the product engineer to create the widget and content to provide text for the widget. This can take some time. Please plan for at least 2 weeks ahead of staging review.** 

### Additional key entry points
None at this point

##  <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
The identified entry point is the existing About form page. That section is being updated by Public Websites and Content and IA teams. These teams will be responsible for the redirect for the existing About page URL.  


## <a name="launch"></a>Launch coordination <br>
*Communication when preparing for launch is critical to ensuring all supporting content, links, and messaging are implemented in a timely manner to ensure a good experience. Missing any of these steps can result in findability challenges, incorrect or misleading information, duplicate content, etc. *

| Key task | Responsibility | When to complete | Additional info |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Communicate if staged/incremental launch is planned | VEBT | ASAP | initiates coordination of widget creation |
