## <a name="flows"></a>Navigation/page flows <br>

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

## <a name="url"></a>Page URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site. This section will also document form or tool flow URLs, titled sub-URLs.*


**1) Schedule a burial in a VA national cemetery - New (form)**
- URL: https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/schedule-a-burial/schedule-burial-va-national-cemetery/
- Breadcrumb: VA.gov home > Burials and memorials > Schedule a burial for a Veteran or family member > Schedule a burial in a VA national cemetery
- Notes: 




## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>

Teams must launch with at least one entry point that allows site visitors to navigate to the new content or feature. 

### Required entry point(s)

1. **[Schedule a burial for a Veteran or family member](https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/schedule-a-burial/)**
  - Placement description: Central content team should evaluate page content and add the online form as appropriate to instructions/information.
  - Link details
    - Link label: TBD by content
    - Link destination: https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/schedule-a-burial/schedule-burial-va-national-cemetery/
  - Notes:
    - Who will update: content
    - When will this entry point go live: Required for launch (preview of entry point required for staging review)
    - Please note: if the product team chooses to do an incremental rollout/launch (anything less than 100%), you must work with Content and IA to create and test the widget well ahead of staging review. 

### Additional key entry points
_Any additional key locations that the page should be navigable from. Although these are not required for launch, they are critical to the findability of your content/feature.  Examples of key entry points include "About a form" pages, additional navigation component (top, left) placements, additional static pages where its prominently linked from, etc._

1. **Hub side navigation**
  - Placement description: Add link to form in side navigation as the first option under Schedule a burial as a child page
  - Link details
    - Link label: TBD
    - Link destination: https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/schedule-a-burial/schedule-burial-va-national-cemetery/
  - Notes:
    - Who will update: IA
    - When will this entry point go live: post 100% launch
   
  **Please note: Because this form flow does not have a PDF version or official form number, an About form page will not be added at this time under the Find a form section due to template constraints. If an option becomes available at a future date, we will reconsider.**

##  <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
*A list of any critical redirects needed as part of this product/feature launch. Redirects are required for any URL changes to ensure visitors do not receive a 404 - Page not found error in the experience.* 

At this time, no redirect are needed. 


## <a name="bestbets"></a>Search best bets
*Search “best bets” are suggested pages that appear in the “Our top recommendations for you” section when you perform a search on VA.gov. Best bets are not implemented for every page, and not intended to be permanent.  They can aid in helping visitors find key content and features that are not ranking search well or competing with similar pages in search results. Existing best bets must be removed or updated when links/URLs change.*

Need for best bets TBD. 

## <a name="launch"></a>Launch coordination <br>
*Communication when preparing for launch is critical to ensuring all supporting content, links, and messaging are implemented in a timely manner to ensure a good experience. Missing any of these steps can result in findability challenges, incorrect or misleading information, duplicate content, etc. *

Key task | Responsibility | When to complete | Additional info
--- | --- | --- | ---
Communicate rollout plan (widget or no widget) | product team | Once decided |
Communicate date of staging review | product team | Once scheduled | 
Communicate launch date | product team | Share anticapated and finalized dates once available |


### Staged rollout
*Is the team planning a staged rollout? Roll-outs hidden behind a flipper flag need a static page to place a sign in widget or CTA on. Pages/sections where a sign in widget can't be implemented - find a form pages, within accordions, hub pages*

The team is still considering a staged rollout as of Nov 6.
