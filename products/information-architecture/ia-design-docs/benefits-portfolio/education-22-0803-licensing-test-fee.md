      - va.gov/education/disclose-information-to-third-party/authorize-disclosure-form-22-10278/review-and-submit/

  - Please refer to [URL standards for form flows](https://design.va.gov/components/url-standards/#guidelines-for-urls-in-form-flows) when defining the URLs for these pages.  Reach out to #content-ia-centralized-team with any questions.


## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>

Teams must launch with at least one entry point that allows site visitors to navigate to the new content or feature. 

**Please note:** The Governance Team requires preview links of updated entry points as a part of staging review in the Collaboration Cycle. It may be a launch-blocking issue. Updates that will be done by the Content and IA team, as noted below, should be requested a minimum of one week before the staging review cutoff (four days prior to scheduled review). Two weeks of advanced knowledge is preferred when possible. Please communicate the staging review date as soon as it is scheduled to your main Content and IA contact. 

### Required entry point(s)

1. **Disclose personal information to a third party for education benefits**
  - Entry page URL: va.gov/education/disclose-information-to-third-party/
  - Placement description: Add a link to the form as appropriate
  - Link details
    - Link label: Authorize VA to disclose personal information to a third party for education benefits
    - Link destination: va.gov/education/disclose-information-to-third-party/authorize-disclosure-form-22-10278/
  - Notes:
    - Who will update: Content will add the link as a part of the page creation
    - When will this entry point go live: at launch
    - **Note: If the form will be released incrementally, a widget will be required. This requires coordination between the product engineer to create the widget and content to provide text for the widget.** 

### Additional key entry points


##  <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
No redirects are needed. 


## <a name="launch"></a>Launch coordination <br>
*Communication when preparing for launch is critical to ensuring all supporting content, links, and messaging are implemented in a timely manner to ensure a good experience. Missing any of these steps can result in findability challenges, incorrect or misleading information, duplicate content, etc. *
