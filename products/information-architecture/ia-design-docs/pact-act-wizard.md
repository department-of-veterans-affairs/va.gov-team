## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
High level user flow can be found at this [mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1696975742113/017abd9b6c2d0e21244cf20d209560af0deb25bc?sender=ua67f17f1c416a96ea04d2476)

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
The new wizard will live under ROOT, but the primary way of accessing the tool is from the [R+S PACT Act page](https://www.va.gov/resources/the-pact-act-and-your-va-benefits/) and other crosslinking opportunities.

![pact-act-eligibility will live under ROOT](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/122126772/193320d4-84e8-4f6e-ab7d-3a710c84e31a)


## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs


**1) PACT Act Wizard - New**
- URL: va.gov/pact-act-eligibility
- Breadcrumb: Home > [H1 of tool]
- Notes: This is the base URL that the team can build on for each question in the flow as needed. Ex: /introduction page, Q1, Q2, etc.We may expand this into more of a toxic exposure wizard in the future, which would go beyond PACT Act. We should still focus on PACT now, but just wanted to make you aware of that for future. I also spoke with Mikki about that. If we do expand this in the future, we'll need to rethink the URL.


## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
The only entry point to the wizard is the R+S page. But the full list of entry points in this workflow can be found at this [mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1696975742113/017abd9b6c2d0e21244cf20d209560af0deb25bc?sender=ua67f17f1c416a96ea04d2476)


## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
This is a new page, so we wont need redirects.

## <a name="bestbets"></a>Best Bets
We currently have a best bet set up for the R+S page. We can create an identical best bet for the wizard, so that both links show up in search. Ya'll will just need to tell us when the Wizard link is live, and we can set up the best bet
