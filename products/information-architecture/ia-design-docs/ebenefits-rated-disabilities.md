# IA Review and Recommendations

**Team:** eBenefits

**Product/Featue:** View Disability Rating

**Background/Context:**
 The Veteran will be coming to this page for 3 main things with a few secondary actions.
- See their Total Rated Disabilities Calculation - this tells them how much benefit pay they can seek from the VA.
  -In case there is an error or if the Veteran wants to learn more about this, there are some helpful links available.
  -In case there is need for an adjustment, there is a link with info on that as well.
- See the breakdown of that calculation - in case there is more or less than expected, the Veteran can see what is included in the formula for the Total Rated Disabilities Calculation
- Track and manage any pending rated disabilities - in the event that there are other ratings that have not yet been accounted for, the Veteran can see their status.
  - The Veteran can click for more details in the Pending Status table and be taken over to the Claim Status Tool

### IA and URL 

**Structure:**   
- Pages shown in site map here: https://app.moqups.com/Rnc4BDEKrA/view/page/ac5c05e4d
- This page will exist under the Disability hub as you have identified.  The actual tool will be nested below the static page.

**URLs:**
- Static page URL: www.va.gov/disability/view-disability-rating/
- Report/dynamic page URL: www.va.gov/disability/view-disability-rating/rating

This is a functional/dynamic page where users complete tasks, so we generally lead these pages with action words.  We try to avoid using "My" or "Your" when possible as they can be misinterpreted by different user roles. 


### Navigation/Entry Points

**Primary**
- Disability hub will include a link under the "Manage" spoke. This link will appear on the hub page as well as in the left nav as the 2nd option under the "Manage" spoke
- I would recommend that content and link also be added to the Disability Calculator tool that is currently being worked on so that users know they can log in to see their actual rating.  
- A link can also be added to the calculator from the Disability Ratings static page for users who may not have a rating or who are not logged in. 
- Also consider a link from within the Profile page.

**Crosslinking**
- Potential future enhancement is to add a link to this tool from any eligibility content where a specific disability rating is a term of eligibility.  We have taken a similar approach with the discharge upgrade tool

### Redirects/Canonical 
- eBenefits technical team is handling all redirects from the eBenefits domain.
