**STATUS: In Progress**

**Team:** OCTO

**IA Request:** [76427](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/929/views/26?pane=issue&itemId=53446972) and [76428](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/929/views/26?pane=issue&itemId=53447198)

## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
 For phase 1 we're just covering findability of existing 'Apply' resources from the family member hub. We are not covering 'manage' resources for Phase 1.

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
The family member hub will contain 6 subhubs.

One of the subhubs will actually just be the home loans page, which we need to migrate in family hub.

We will also include the pages for Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFG) and CHAMPVA in the family member hub structure for phase 1. We may be able to include the surviving spouse home loan program pages pending stakeholder agreement.

## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>

1. **Mega Menu - EDIT** -
  - Link label: Family member and caregiver benefits
  - Link URL: va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/
 ![mega menu changes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/122126772/01cede9c-bd6c-4973-b1c1-f988b1de56c9)


2. **Home Page - EDIT** -
  - Link label: Family member and caregiver benefits
  - Link URL: va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/
![home page location](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/122126772/845851be-6baf-4e89-b1ed-706f94c5d3a2)


3. **Left Nav - ADD** -

- Health care and disability compensation

      - CHAMPVA application 1010d
      - OHI form 7959c
      - File claim 7959a

4. **Crosslinks - ADD**
For phase 1, each subhub will feature links and a short description to the following things. This is probably best viewed directly in [mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1684260449054/7d2a6588b6861b0fb19a31d73cad49fe1a5abd3d?wid=0-1712161880616), but I've also included a list of the links we intend to go to. For phase 1 we will just be linking to these pages (anchor linking to the relevant family member section if possible). In later phases we might create new pages in the family member hub about the family member benefit (Ex: in the future we might have 2 mental health pages, one for veterans and one for family members, that crosslink to eachother).
