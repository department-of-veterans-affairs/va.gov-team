## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs

**1) H1 of page - New**
- URL: www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/lay-witness-statement-form-21-10210
- Breadcrumb: VA.gov home > H1 of supporting forms page > H1 of form page
- Notes: Since the supporting forms page is still in progress, we are using an H1 placeholder until it is established. For the URL, we decided to move forward with "lay witness" as this seemed to be a combination with higher search results while staying true to the H1.



## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>

1. **[Supporting forms page](https://www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/)** - Add
  - Placement description: 
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/lay-witness-statement-form-21-10210
  - Notes: Since the supporting forms page is currently in progress, we have left the placement description blank in the meantime.
