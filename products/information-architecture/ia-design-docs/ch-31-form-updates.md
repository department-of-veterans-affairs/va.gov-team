Team's [Mural for Ch 31 user flows](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1684161597392/5c1f8869cf5d03b792c8b82cf19b39dc26c486c2?sender=u79ee90295fdb006d7f463212)

No changes to where the page lives


## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs


## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
*A list of new internal entry points, as well as changes to any existing entry points. This list focuses on the primary entry points and does not include all possible crosslinking opportunities. Consider whether a Search Best Bet might be useful if this product enhances a Top Task for veterans.*

### Chapter 31 Entry Points
1. **[About VA Form 28-1900](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-28-1900/)** - Modify
  - Placement description: Update link destination so users are routed directly into the form flow
  - Link label: Go to the online tool
  - Link destination: https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/apply-vre-form-28-1900
  - Notes: Currently, the link directs users to the [How to apply page](https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/how-to-apply/). Since users are coming to find a VA form with a specific form in mind, I think it would make sense to update the link so they're able to go right into the form flow.

2. **[Veteran Readiness and Employment (Chapter 31)](https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/)** - Add
  - Placement description: Add a link to the form in the left nav as a child page under "Veteran Readiness and Employment". It will be the 4th option down within the other child pages.
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/apply-vre-form-28-1900
  - Notes: The URL already represents the form as a child page to "Veteran Readiness and Employment" so we just want to update the left nav so it matches the URL as well as the content on the page.
