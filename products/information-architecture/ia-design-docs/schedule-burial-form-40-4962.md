## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
The team created and is maintaining a [form flow in mural](https://app.mural.co/t/bahdigitalexperience6902/m/bahdigitalexperience6902/1675280667287/c6562c0bb7c18a82c30e2319cb2ee7186436a45f?wid=0-1693401017605&sender=ua67f17f1c416a96ea04d2476).

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
Maintained in our [IA forms mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1679086662310/cbe41468d45afc03206a3d0a7f6b979517c523d8?sender=ua67f17f1c416a96ea04d2476).

## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs


**1) New - VA National Cemetery Request Form**
- URL: https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/schedule-a-burial/[H1 TBD by content]-form-40-4962
- Breadcrumb: Home > Burials and memorials > Schedule a burial > [H1 TBD by content]
- Notes:  Suggestion from product team for H1 - “Apply for burial in a VA national cemetery’. Also, if we decide to change the static page H1 or left nav, make sure we change the breadcrumb here to reflect that


## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>

1. **Modify Left Nav**
  - Placement description: Add a new page within ‘Schedule a burial’ sub-nav, above ‘Military funeral honors’
  - Link label: [Abridged H1 TBD by content]
  - Link destination: will go to the URL of the VA National Cemetery Request Form

2. **Add 'Find a Form' page**
  - The find a form tool will need a new entry for this form. Here is an example of the find-a-form options for burials: https://www.va.gov/find-forms/?q=burials

3. **Update Burials Mega Menu**
  - The mega menu has a related problem that we should fix.
  - Link label: **Schedule a burial for a family member**
  -- This goes to the ‘scedule a burial’ static page
  -- The link label should be updated to match whatever H1 we choose for the schedule a burial page
 - Link label: **Schedule a burial in a VA national cemetery**
  -- This link goes to a legacy page that we already migrated. We should remove this link entirely from the mega menu.

4. **Possibly update burials hub page**
  - we probably don’t need a link here. There is already a link in the ‘plan a burial’ section to the static page, which we want ppl to go to first, since there is such a process.
  - however, if we update the H1 or URL of the 'schedule a burial' static page, we will want to update it here too

## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
If we decide to change the H1 of the ‘SChedule a burial’ static page, and we need to update the URL as a result, we will need a redirect. But that is TBD

 ## <a name="bestbets"></a>Best Bets <br>
 There is currently a best bet set up for the static page. We should update the description or keywords to include the new form.
1. Set up a new best bet for the ‘schedule a burial’ form URL once we have it
2. Update the description and keywords for the current ‘schedule-a-burial’ static a page to include the forms.
