# IA Design for Plaques and Urns Page
**STATUS: In progress**

**Team:** OCTO

**IA Request:** [Link to Sitewide Content and IA intake request]

**On this page:**
- User/page flows
- [Page structure](#map)
- [URLs and breadcrumbs](#url)
- [Entry points](#nav)
- Redirects
- [Best Bets](#bestbets)
- Staged Rollout



## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site. This section will also document form or tool flow URLs, titled sub-URLs.*


**1) H1 of page - New**
- URL: https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/memorial-items/plaques-urns/
- Breadcrumb: VA.gov Home > Burials and memorials > H1 of page


## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>

### Primary entry point
_Most of the time this is the CTA on a tool static landing page (a sign in widget).  For forms, it may be on a How to apply page or equivalent. Sometimes the only way to access a feature is via navigation component (top, left) or a header/footer/home page link. This is the only entry point that HAS to be ready to launch when a team goes through staging review._

1. **H1 of page** - Add
  - Placement description: As a child page to `Memorial items` in Burial hub
  - Link destination: https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/memorial-items/plaques-urns/
  - Notes: This page will live on the same level as the current page: https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/memorial-items/headstones-markers-medallions/ but will be the 2nd option down on the `Memorial items` page and in left nav

### Secondary entry points
_Any additional locations that the page should be navigable from.  This is often an about-a-form page, an R&S page about the feature, or can be left nav or mega menu.   These are secondary, and while they are still very important, are not required for launch._

1. **[Honor a Veteran or Reservist with memorial items](https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/memorial-items/)** - Add
  - Placement description: 2nd option down, below `/headstones-markers-medallions/` page
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/memorial-items/plaques-urns/

2. **Burial left nav** - Add

  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content

## <a name="bestbets"></a>Best Bets<br>
*Search “best bets” are suggested pages that appear in the “Our top recommendations for you” section when you perform a search on VA.gov. These suggestions are selected for specific terms and are intended to help veterans and their beneficiaries find relevant results quickly. We want to make sure that best bets are not linking to the deprecated page.*

## <a name="stagedrollout"></a>Staged Rollout<br>
*Is the team planning a staged rollout? Pages/sections that can't have a widget: find a form pages, within accordions, hub pages*

**[Which static page has the widget, ie the main entry point?]**
