## <a name="flows"></a>Navigation/page flows <br>

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

- The existing [CHAMPVA benefit page](https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/health-and-disability/champva/) will serve as the parent page to all information and tasks related to the CHAMPVA program.
- Child pages of the CHAMPVA benefit page will include the application form, the OHI form, and the claim form.

## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs

**1) CHAMPVA claim form - NEW**
- Canonical URL: va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/health-and-disability/champva/file-champva-claim-10-7959a/
  - Sub-pages of this form flow will be appended to the end of this canonical URL - i.e. /introduction, /review-and-submit, /confirmation
  - All links should utilize the canonical URL as the destination - this allows the form code to identify and render the initial page of the flow and any changes to that won't break referring links.
- Breadcrumb:
  - The breadcrumb that appears on the initial page of the form flow (i.e. the /introduction page) will remain as is throughout the form flow, all the way through the confirmation page as defined in the [breadcrumbs for linear page flows standard in the VA design system.](https://design.va.gov/components/breadcrumbs#breadcrumbs-for-linear-page-flows)  
  - Desktop breadcrumb: VA.gov home > [Family and caregiver benefits H1] > [Health and disability benefits H1] > [CHAMPVA benefits page H1] > [10-7959a form H1]
    - Example: VA.gov home > VA Benefits for family and caregivers > Health and disability benefits for family and caregivers > CHAMPVA benefits > File claim for benefits VA Form 10-7959a
  - Mobile breadcrumb: <  [CHAMPVA benefits page H1]
    - Example: < CHAMPVA benefits 


## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>

    
### Entry point(s) required for launch

1. **[CHAMPVA benefit page](https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/health-and-disability/champva/)**
    - This is the parent page of the claim form flow and therefore is required to have supporting content and a link to the claim form
    - Placement, link label, and content to be determined by content

### Additional key entry points

1.**Family hub left nav**
    - Once the claim form is live to 100% of visitors, an option should be added to the left nav within the family benefits hub
    - The option will be nested under the CHAMPVA benefits page and placed after the online application option
    - Link label should match the H1 of the page

2. **[About form 10-7959a page](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-10-7959a/)**
   - Once the claim form is live to 100% of visitors, an option should be added to the about form page that allows visitors quick access to the online version of the form.
   - Content and link label will follow standard approach used for these pages

## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>

- [5/9 update] - the form is live in production but has the wrong URL. IVC forms team will submit a redirect request to change https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/health-and-disability/file-champva-claim-10-7959a/ to va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/health-and-disability/champva/file-champva-claim-10-7959a/


## <a name="bestbets"></a>Best Bets<br>

- TBD, not needed until after launch    

## <a name="stagedrollout"></a>Staged Rollout<br>
*If a staged rollout is planned, a flipper that controls access to the feature will be required. That flipper should be placed on the page that serves as the primary entry point for the feature. 
Some pages/sections cannot contain a widget - i.e. find a form pages, within accordions, hub pages*

- **Staged rollout planned:**  Yes
- **Static page to contain the flipper:**  [CHAMPVA benefit page](https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/health-and-disability/champva/)
- **Any other requirements related to the staged rollout?** No
