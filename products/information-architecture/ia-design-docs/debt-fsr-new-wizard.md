## <a name="pagestructure"></a>Page Structure

We will update the 'Manage VA Debt' page to point to several different static, drupal-managed pages with information about debt help.

We will be creating a new static, drupal-managed page about requesting help for education, pension, and disability overpayment debt, and that page will link to the debt help form 5655.

Up-to-date diagram can be found on [mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1682537441750/a9937e9953d80c221c5165131f611026e0419c7b?sender=ua67f17f1c416a96ea04d2476) (see Version 3). Note that this team initially considered a subtask component for an outdated wizard, but decided on a content-first approach instead. The previous iterations of this solution can be found in V1 and V2 in the mural above.
