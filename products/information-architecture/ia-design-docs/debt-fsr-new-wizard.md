## <a name="flows"></a>Navigational flows <br>
_Illustration and/or description of how users will navigate to and flow through the experience for all impacted visitors typies. This helps identify key entry points and findability requirements, user flow scenarios, and content/messaging needs across various scenarios._

- Users can learn about options to resolve debt through one or more pages published in Resources and support (number of pages TBD based on content design decisions)
- The R&S content will be findable via internal and external search and links, as well as direct links from the Manage VA debt landing page and the FSR introduction page
- The R&S pages(s) will provide links back to the Manage VA debt landing page and FSR introduction page as appropriate

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
_Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site._

- There are no major changes to the existing structure of the "debt portal"
- The wizard screens will be removed from the online FSR (5655) and new content pages will be created within Resources and Support

## <a name="url"></a>Page URLs and breadcrumbs
_URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site. This section will also document form or tool flow URLs, titled sub-URLs._

- There are no changes to URLs or breadcrumbs for any pages within the /manage-va-debt/ space
- The /introduction page of the FSR form 5655 will be updated to remove the wizard questions, but that will not result in a URL or breadcrumb change




## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
_An entry point is a link or CTA that allows a site visitor to navigate to a page or feature._


### Required entry point(s)

Because there are no changes to the primary task flow - ability to navigate to and submit an FSR - there are no entry point changes required for launch.  The entry point to the FSR is already in place on the [Manage VA debt landing page](https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/), and it will remain as the primary entry point to this task.



### Other key entry points

1. **[Manage VA debt landing page](https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/)**
    - Description:
      - Add link(s) to applicable R&S pages related to requesting financial help or disputing charges
    - Notes:
      - To be completed by Content and IA team after R&S pages launch


2. **[FSR Form 5655 introduction page](https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction)**
    - Description:

3. **Health care benefit hub left nav**
    - Description

##  <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
*A list of any critical redirects needed as part of this product/feature launch. Redirects are required for any URL changes to ensure visitors do not receive a 404 - Page not found error in the experience.* 

Redirect ticket to be created and managed by the content and IA team 


| Page Name                | Current URL                                                       | Will redirect to…               |

| Dispute copays           | https://www.va.gov/health-care/pay-copay-bill/dispute-charges/    | TBD based on H1 at R+S location |
| Request help with copays | https://www.va.gov/health-care/pay-copay-bill/financial-hardship/ | TBD based on H1 at R+S location |




## <a name="bestbets"></a>Search best bets
*Search “best bets” are suggested pages that appear in the “Our top recommendations for you” section when you perform a search on VA.gov. Best bets are not implemented for every page, and not intended to be permanent.  They can aid in helping visitors find key content and features that are not ranking search well or competing with similar pages in search results. Existing best bets must be removed or updated when links/URLs change.*

No new best bets needed for launch.
