## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
There will be no redirects as part of this since the form doesn't exist yet. 


## <a name="bestbets"></a>Best Bets<br>

No best bets for these, we will have a best bet for the CHAMPVA static page.                                                                                                            |

## <a name="stagedrollout"></a>Staged Rollout<br>
*Is the team planning a staged rollout? Pages/sections that can't have a widget: find a form pages, within accordions, hub pages*

Yes, will be doing staged rollout.

**[Which static page has the widget, ie the main entry point?]**
- the static champva page
