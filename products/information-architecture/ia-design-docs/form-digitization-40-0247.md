## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
*Illustration and/or description of how users will flow through the experience. The user flow helps illustrate how visitors will navigate to and through your product/feature, ensures all types of visitors and scenarios are accounted for, and aids in identifying all content and messaging needs.*

Team's user flows can be found [here in this Mural board](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1689262768121/889649b79a8c16be86c3e65790d393b9f4af3e36?sender=u79ee90295fdb006d7f463212).

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

The new form will live under the existing details page for Presidential Memorial Certificate.

## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*


**1) H1 of page - New**
- URL: www.va.gov/burials-memorials/memorial-items/presidential-memorial-certificates/request-certificate-form-40-0247/
- Breadcrumb: VA.gov home > Burials and memorials > Memorial items > Presidential Memorial Certificates > H1 of page 
- Notes: Subsequent pages will add on to the above URL using short and simple labels, i.e. .../introduction/. We can provide further guidance on these additions if needed.


## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
*A list of new internal entry points, as well as changes to any existing entry points. This list focuses on the primary entry points and does not include all possible crosslinking opportunities.*


1. [Presidential Memorial Certificates](https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/memorial-items/presidential-memorial-certificates/) - Add
  - Placement description: Online application CTA should be listed as the first option under section "How do I apply for a Presidential Memorial Certificate?" and the QuickSubmit option removed. Connect with the Content team to confirm formatting for the remaining application opportunities so it aligns with other similar form static pages.
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: www.va.gov/burials-memorials/memorial-items/presidential-memorial-certificates/request-certificate-form-40-0247/
  - Notes: 
 

## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
*A list of any critical redirects needed as part of this product/feature launch. Redirects are required for any URL changes to ensure visitors do not receive a 404 - Page not found error in the experience. For any redirects listed, please submit a request for the redirect using the [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=mnorthuis&labels=content-ia-team%2C+ia&template=redirect-request.md&title=Redirect+Request) at least 2 weeks in advance.*

#### August 3, 2023 - Redirect recommendation
Connected with Beth P about redirecting the legacy informational page and this page will be a part of the broader migration work. For now, okay to leave as is and not move forward with a redirect recommendation at this moment.
