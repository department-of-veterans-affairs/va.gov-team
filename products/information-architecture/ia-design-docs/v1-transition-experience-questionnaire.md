**On this page:**
- [User/page flows](#flows)
- [Page structure](#map)
- [URLs and breadcrumbs](#url)

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
For the MVP, this tool will only display careers/employment benefits. But, the future plan is to have this tool display all types of benefits. Therefore, we decided to publish this page into ROOT so that we don't have to change the URL a bunch of times as new benefits are added to the tool.

## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
The URL should be a permenant home for the tool. 

**1) Transition experience benefit questionnaire - New**
- URL: va.gov/benefit-eligibility-questionnaire/ (TBD!!!)
- Breadcrumb: none since only 2 levels deep?
- Notes: This URL is not finalized -- it's just a suggestion to show the idea of the URL being benefit-agnostic, rather than focused specifically on careers. The final URL needs to be created in partnership with the content team.

### Sub-URLs
The CAIA IA team would like to give feedback on the sub urls that the team suggests. 

## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>

### Primary entry point
_Most of the time this is the CTA on a tool static landing page (a sign in widget).  For forms, it may be on a How to apply page or equivalent. Sometimes the only way to access a feature is via navigation component (top, left) or a header/footer/home page link. This is the only entry point that HAS to be ready to launch when a team goes through staging review._

1. **[Getting started with VA](https://www.va.gov/resources/getting-started-with-va/)** - Add
   -  Placement description: TBD by content, but somewhere on this page we can direct ppl to the questionnaire static page
  - Link label: TBD by content
  - Link destination: TBD questionnaire static page


### Secondary entry points
_Any additional locations that the page should be navigable from.  This is often an about-a-form page, an R&S page about the feature, or can be left nav or mega menu.   These are secondary, and while they are still very important, are not required for launch._

1. **[Careers and employment hub page](https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/)** - Add
  - Placement description: In the 'More information and resources' section, after 'VetSuccess on Campus' and before 'Veteran Readiness and Employment glossary'
  - Link label: TBD by content
  - Link destination: TBD questionnaire static page

## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
No redirects needed since this is a net-new tool


## <a name="bestbets"></a>Best Bets<br>
We could look into a best bet that might make sense, but unlikely that users are going to be searching for careers-specific explorer tool

## <a name="stagedrollout"></a>Staged Rollout<br>
*Is the team planning a staged rollout? Pages/sections that can't have a widget: find a form pages, within accordions, hub pages*

**[Which static page has the widget, ie the main entry point?]**
