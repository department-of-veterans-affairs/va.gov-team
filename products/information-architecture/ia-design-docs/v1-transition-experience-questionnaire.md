## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
[Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1716219020147/013c6f25f45e35963469c7bb7a94b66e1402f663?wid=0-1722446695647)
For the V1, this tool will only display careers/employment benefits, and will be shown in production only to a specific set of internal VA users. For V2, the team will include all main benefit types, and the tool will become available to general VA.gov users.

## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
The URL should be a permenant home for the tool. 

**1) Transition experience benefit questionnaire - New**
- URL: va.gov/discover-your-benefits/
- Breadcrumb: none since only 2 levels deep

### Sub-URLs
The CAIA IA team would like to give feedback on the sub urls that the team suggests. 

## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>

### Primary entry point
_Most of the time this is the CTA on a tool static landing page (a sign in widget).  For forms, it may be on a How to apply page or equivalent. Sometimes the only way to access a feature is via navigation component (top, left) or a header/footer/home page link. This is the only entry point that HAS to be ready to launch when a team goes through staging review._

1. **[Getting started with VA](https://www.va.gov/resources/getting-started-with-va/)** - Add
   -  Placement description: TBD by content, but somewhere on this page we can direct ppl to the questionnaire static page
  - Link label: TBD by content
  - Link destination: TBD questionnaire static page


### Secondary entry points - BLOCKED

1. **[Service member hub page](https://www.va.gov/service-member-benefits/)** - Add
  - Placement description: Add a new 'Other VA benefits and services' grey box section (like this one in the [disability hub](https://www.va.gov/disability/)), and link to the R+S page from there. 
  - Link label: Getting started with the VA
  - Link destination: https://www.va.gov/resources/getting-started-with-va/
  - NOTE: the team is still deciding whether they want to put an entry point here, because there is so much more traffic (60k/month according to Gene). So since we aren't doing incremental release, it is riskier to add an entry point here, in case something goes wrong, or we find that info is incorrect. Decision: don't include this entry point at launch, but we could consider adding it in the future. 


## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
No redirects needed since this is a net-new tool


## <a name="bestbets"></a>Best Bets<br>
We could look into a best bet that might make sense, but unlikely that users are going to be searching for careers-specific explorer tool. Our current best bet strategy is to keep the best bet on the getting-started-at-VA R+S page, rather than creating an additional one for the questionnaire. 

## <a name="stagedrollout"></a>Staged Rollout<br>
The team is not going to do a staged rollout.
