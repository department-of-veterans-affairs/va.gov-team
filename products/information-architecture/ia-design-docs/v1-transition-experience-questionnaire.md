## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
[Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1716219020147/013c6f25f45e35963469c7bb7a94b66e1402f663?wid=0-1722446695647)
For the V1, this tool will only display careers/employment benefits, and will be shown in production only to a specific set of internal VA users. For V2, the team will include all main benefit types, and the tool will become available to general VA.gov users.

## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
The URL should be a permenant home for the tool. 

**1) Transition experience benefit questionnaire - New**
- URL: va.gov/discover-your-benefits/
- Breadcrumb: none since only 2 levels deep

### Sub-URLs
The CAIA IA team would like to give feedback on the sub urls that the team suggests. 

## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>

### Primary entry point
_Most of the time this is the CTA on a tool static landing page (a sign in widget).  For forms, it may be on a How to apply page or equivalent. Sometimes the only way to access a feature is via navigation component (top, left) or a header/footer/home page link. This is the only entry point that HAS to be ready to launch when a team goes through staging review._

1. **[Getting started with VA](https://www.va.gov/resources/getting-started-with-va/)** - Add
   -  Placement description: TBD by content, but somewhere on this page we can direct ppl to the questionnaire static page
  - Link label: TBD by content
  - Link destination: TBD questionnaire static page


### Secondary entry points
_Any additional locations that the page should be navigable from.  This is often an about-a-form page, an R&S page about the feature, or can be left nav or mega menu.   These are secondary, and while they are still very important, are not required for launch._

1. **[Service member hub page](https://www.va.gov/service-member-benefits/)** - Add
  - Placement description: Add a new 'Other VA benefits and services' grey box section (like this one in the [disability hub](https://www.va.gov/disability/)), and link to the R+S page from there. 
  - Link label: Getting started with the VA
  - Link destination: https://www.va.gov/resources/getting-started-with-va/


## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
No redirects needed since this is a net-new tool


## <a name="bestbets"></a>Best Bets<br>
We could look into a best bet that might make sense, but unlikely that users are going to be searching for careers-specific explorer tool

## <a name="stagedrollout"></a>Staged Rollout<br>
*Is the team planning a staged rollout? Pages/sections that can't have a widget: find a form pages, within accordions, hub pages*

**[Which static page has the widget, ie the main entry point?]**
