## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs

**1) NEW Foreign Medical Program Registration**
- URL: va.gov/health-care/foreign-medical-program/register-form-10-7959f-1/
- Breadcrumb: Va.gov home > Health care > Foreign Medical Program (FMP) > [Form H1 TBD by content]

## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points and crosslinks <br>
*A list of new internal entry points, as well as changes to any existing entry points. This list focuses on the primary entry points and does not include all possible crosslinking opportunities. Consider whether a Search Best Bet might be useful if this product enhances a Top Task for veterans.*


1. **Modify Left Nav**
  - Placement description: nested under 'Foreign Medical Program'
  - Link label: TBD based on H1, probably something like 'Register now'
  - Link destination: va.gov/health-care/foreign-medical-program/register-form-10-7959f-1/

3. **Add link/section '[How to file a VA foreign medical program claim'](https://www.va.gov/resources/how-to-file-a-va-foreign-medical-program-claim/)**
  - Placement description: Add link and information about registering (because you have to register before you can submit a claim, and it doesn't say anything about that here.)
  - Link label: TBD by content
  - Link destination: Probably https://www.va.gov/health-care/foreign-medical-program/, but content can confirm

4. **Modify link/section of '[Getting care through the Foreign Medical Program'](https://www.va.gov/resources/getting-care-through-the-foreign-medical-program/)**
  - Placement description: In the accordion 'Does FMP cover COVID-19 vaccines', there is an instruction to submit paper registration form. We should confirm whether this process changes with the online form, and make sure to update this section if so.
  - Link label: TBD by content
  - Link destination: Probably va.gov/health-care/foreign-medical-program/register-form-10-7959f-1/, but content can confirm 


4. **Modify benefits.gov FMP page - NOT SURE!**
  - Placement description: TBD by content
  - Link label: TBD by content
  - Link destination: va.gov/health-care/foreign-medical-program/register-form-10-7959f-1/
  - Note: content has final say on whether we're going to modify this page or not. Content and product team would collab on getting the stakeholders to edit together.

## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
No redirects needed since this is a brand-new online.

## <a name="bestbets"></a>Best Bets<br>
No best bet needed since we have one set up for the static Foreign Medical Program page

## <a name="stagedrollout"></a>Staged Rollout<br>
Yes, staged rollout

**[Which static page has the widget, ie the main entry point?]**
- The FMP static page I believe will have the widget.
