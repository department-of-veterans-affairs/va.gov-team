## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
Note: This page will live under the current [Review or change dependents for disability, pension, or DIC benefits](https://www.va.gov/view-change-dependents) page. The URL of this page is planned to update to /manage-dependents/ from /view-change-dependents/ before this form launches. That process is being managed by the dependents team and Central Content and IA team.

## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs

**1) Verify your dependents for disability benefits - NEW**
- URL: va.gov/manage-dependents/verify-form-21-0538/
   - Suburl example: va.gov/manage-dependents/verify-form-21-0538/confirmation/
- Breadcrumb: VA.gov home > Manage dependents > [H1 of 0538]


## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
Teams must launch with at least one entry point that allows site visitors to navigate to the new content or feature. 

### Required entry point(s)

1. **Review or change dependents for disability, pension, or DIC benefits**
  - Placement description: A section should be added to the page for the 0538 form
  - Link: https://www.va.gov/view-change-dependents
  - Notes:
    - Who will update: Central Content
    - When will this entry point go live: at launch

### Additional key entry points
_Any additional key locations that the page should be navigable from. Although these are not required for launch, they are critical to the findability of your content/feature.  Examples of key entry points include "About a form" pages, additional navigation component (top, left) placements, additional static pages where its prominently linked from, etc._

1. **About VA Form 21-0538**
  - Placement description: Add link for online tool
  - Link: https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-0538/
  - Notes:
    - Who will update: Central Content
    - When will this entry point go live: at launch
   
Note: Crosslinks should be added to the About VA form pages for the 686c and 674. Other crosslinks should be evaluated post-launch. 

##  <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
While there will be redirects needed for the parent page and other forms/pages in this section as a part of the section renaming, this form is expected to launch with the updated /manage-dependents/ slug and therefore does not require a redirect itself.  

## <a name="launch"></a>Launch coordination <br>
*Communication when preparing for launch is critical to ensuring all supporting content, links, and messaging are implemented in a timely manner to ensure a good experience. Missing any of these steps can result in findability challenges, incorrect or misleading information, duplicate content, etc. *

Key task | Responsibility | When to complete | Additional info
--- | --- | --- | ---
Communicate date of staging review | Dependents team | Aug 15 | 
Prepare entry point preview links | Content and IA | Prior to staging review |
Communicate launch date | Dependents team | provide target launch window once identified |

### Staged rollout
*Is the team planning a staged rollout? Roll-outs hidden behind a flipper flag need a static page to place a sign in widget or CTA on. Pages/sections where a sign in widget can't be implemented - find a form pages, within accordions, hub pages*

1. What is the team's staged rollout plan?
2. Which page will have the widget that controls views?
3. Does the team need to manage search-engine results during rollout?
