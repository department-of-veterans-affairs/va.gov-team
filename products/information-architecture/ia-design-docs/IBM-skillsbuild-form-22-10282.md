*Note about the content organization on this page: the 'Other VA education benefits' page currently has two H2 sections for organizing benefits. Each heading describes the benefits' relationship with the GI bill. Should we consider adding new H2 for the IBM Skillsbuild program, since this benefit is GI Bill agnostic? (see current H2s in this screenshot)*
