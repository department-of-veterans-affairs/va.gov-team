*Note about the content organization on this page: the 'Other VA education benefits' page currently has two H2 sections for organizing benefits. Each heading describes the benefits' relationship with the GI bill. Should we consider adding new H2 for the IBM Skillsbuild program, since this benefit does not have any dependancy/relationship with GI Bill at all?*

### Crosslinks
TBD by Content. The three options below are more brainstorm than instructions. The options shown on these pages are pretty narrowly scoped, in some cases. So I'd like to defer to Content's input on the best choices.

1. [Careers > Employment resources for veterans](https://va.gov/careers-employment/veteran-resources/)  This page feels like a good subject-matter fit for a crosslink. But the 'More info' links at the bottom are v tightly scoped to Readiness & Employment topics.
<img width="606" alt="ibm crosslink 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7146df64-5ff6-44af-890d-ee93257b8312">


2. [Careers > Education and career counseling for familiy members](https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/education-and-careers/educational-and-career-counseling/) Since the benefit is for family members as well, this might be an option. The 'more info' section on this page has a broader scope.
<img width="579" alt="ibm crosslink 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b9f9d63-4f71-4976-aeeb-d435b4f33f90">


3. Maybe also [Resources and Support > Career resources for military and surviving spouses](https://www.va.gov/resources/career-resources-for-military-and-surviving-spouses/) It has a section at the foot of the page that's not *technically* a 'More' section, but seems to be serving a similar purpose.
<img width="602" alt="ibm crosslink 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a13fc583-fe73-43da-9962-695e9834b889">

## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
*No redirects, since this is a newly digitized form and newly added pages.*


## <a name="bestbets"></a>Best Bets<br>
**Add** a best bet that direct to Benefit Info page. To URL: va.gov/education/other-va-education-benefits/[H1 - TBD by Content]/

<img width="659" alt="ibm best bets 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63953255-4920-42f4-9ec1-a2a5cafa447c">


## <a name="stagedrollout"></a>Staged Rollout<br>
No
