*Note about the content organization on this page: the 'Other VA education benefits' page currently has two H2 sections for organizing benefits. Each heading describes the benefits' relationship with the GI bill. We may want to consider a third H2 for the IBM Skillsbuild program, since it is a benefit with NO relationship to the GI Bill.*
