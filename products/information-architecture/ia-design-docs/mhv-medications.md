The launch of medications to Phase 1 will coincide with all tools that are in Phase 1+ being integrated onto VA.gov (discoverable and linkable from other My HealtheVet tools).

**1)About medications (forced entry point/landing page)**

- Breadcrumb:

- Title tag: Medications | Veterans Affairs
- Notes: [On 6/30 in Slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C04DRS3L9NV/p1688070170040299) we decided that the breadcrumbs will act as if the 'about' landing page page is a parent of medications list, but the page will not be an official parent of medications from a URL standpoint. 

**3) Medication details pages**
- URL: www.va.gov/my-health/medications/prescription/[ID]/
- Breadcrumb:
Opening a details page is considered a mini subtask, and will take on <- Back to[name of page] breadcrumbs:
  - desktop: <- Back to medications
  - mobile: <- Back to medications
- Title tag: [H1] - Medications | Veterans Affairs
- Notes: 
  - URL will be based on unique ID for the individual's specific medication.  It will not be the name of the medication.

 **4) Refill prescriptions - NEW**
- URL: www.va.gov/my-health/medications/refill
- Breadcrumb:

The user flow provided depicts the flow for Phase 0 of this product only.  The entry points, links, and overall flow of the product will evolve as the product progresses through the phased roll-out.  Those flows will eventually be fully documented in the (phased roll-out Mural)[https://app.mural.co/invitation/mural/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1667322271773?sender=u2aba00c97ab77c6ec1573123&key=4ffaed99-2032-4f0b-bbce-bbe7ef27595c].

Decision log: 
* ~As of 6/30/23, the H1 of the Medication page may change to 'Medication and Supplies'. If we do make that change, we may change URLs.
- also note that the url is a sibling structure, but the breadcrumbs will represent a parent strucuture.~ Decided against this
