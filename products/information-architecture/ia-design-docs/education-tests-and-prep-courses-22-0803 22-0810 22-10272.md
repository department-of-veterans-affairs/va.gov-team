## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>

See most up-to-date flow in Mural [here](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1726160586128/343d813fc6515d2e8b2e88aff56aa6fad4fae52d?wid=132-1726168589170)

A note about these flows and forms:

**Licenses and Certifications (L&C)**
- VA will reimburse costs for tests to obtain / maintain licenses and certifications, form 22-0803
- VA will reimburse costs for prep courses for taking license and certification tests, form 22-10272

**National Tests**

- VA will reimburse costs for national higher-ed tests like SAT and GRE, form 22-0810
- VA will reimburse costs for test prep courses for national higher-ed tests like SAT and GRE. There is *no form* for this - org that runs the course submits enrollment verification directly to VA.
- None of the 3 forms are digitized yet.
