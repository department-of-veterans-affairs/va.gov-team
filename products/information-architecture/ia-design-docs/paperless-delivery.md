## <a name="flows"></a>Navigation/page flows <br>

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

## <a name="url"></a>Page URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site. This section will also document form or tool flow URLs, titled sub-URLs.*

**1) Page name - New**
- URL: https://www.va.gov/profile/[notifications-settings]
- Breadcrumb: Home > Profile > [H1]
- Notes: Actual H1 will be informed by [research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/paperless-delivery/Research/2025-05-Research-Initiative-2/Research%20Plan.md) and determined by Content.

**2) Page name - New**
- URL: https://www.va.gov/profile/[paperless-settings]
- Breadcrumb: Home > Profile > [H1]
- Notes: Actual H1 will be informed by [research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/paperless-delivery/Research/2025-05-Research-Initiative-2/Research%20Plan.md) and determined by Content.


## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>

Teams must launch with at least one entry point that allows site visitors to navigate to the new content or feature. 

### Required entry point(s)

1. **Required entry point for launch**
  - [Download Your IRS 1095-B Tax Form hub page](https://staging.va.gov/records/download-your-irs-1095-b/)
  - Entry point link: www.va.gov/profile/paperless
  - Notes: The Content & IA team will update this page to add an entry point to the authenticated Paperless space in Profile. We'll consider additional unauthenticated entry points when the paperless opt-in feature is available for more forms.

### Additional key entry points
- Email notifications
- Profile

##  <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
None

## <a name="bestbets"></a>Search best bets
None

## <a name="launch"></a>Launch coordination
### Staged rollout
*Is the team planning a staged rollout? Roll-outs hidden behind a flipper flag need a static page to place a sign in widget or CTA on. Pages/sections where a sign in widget can't be implemented - find a form pages, within accordions, hub pages*

1. What is the team's staged rollout plan? TBD
2. Which page will have the widget that controls views? TBD
3. Does the team need to manage search-engine results during rollout? No
