## <a name="flows"></a>Navigation/page flows <br>
The Simple Mileage-only Claims feature will live in the authenticated MHV space on VA.gov. Unauthenticated pages will serve as entry points that link to it.

No impact to IA - on-page content changes only

## <a name="url"></a>Page URLs and breadcrumbs
No changes to URLs for launch. There will be a breadcrumb and menu label change for the hub page.

Affected pages:
  
**1) File for travel pay reimbursement - Existing hub page**
- URL: https://www.va.gov/health-care/file-travel-pay-reimbursement/
- Desktop breadcrumb: VA.gov home >  [Health care hub H1] > [File travel pay reimbursement page H1]
- Notes: H1 and menu label change. Menu label is "File travel pay reimbursement"
 
**2) How to file a VA travel reimbursement claim online- Existing**
- URL: https://www.va.gov/resources/how-to-file-a-va-travel-reimbursement-claim-online/
- Notes: this page will need to be revisited in the future since it's very similar in H1 and URL to the page above. We'll leave as is for launch to avoid issues with redirecting.
 
 
## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
 
Teams must launch with at least one entry point that allows site visitors to navigate to the new content or feature. 
 
### Required entry point(s) for launch
 
Content folks will determine where the tool should be cross-linked from but there's no impact to menus in the Health Care hub.


 
## <a name="bestbets"></a>Search best bets
*Search “best bets” are suggested pages that appear in the “Our top recommendations for you” section when you perform a search on VA.gov. Best bets are not implemented for every page, and not intended to be permanent.  They can aid in helping visitors find key content and features that are not ranking search well or competing with similar pages in search results. Existing best bets must be removed or updated when links/URLs change.*

TBD
