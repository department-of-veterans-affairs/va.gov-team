[**IA Review Ticket: 85/15 reporting form 22-10215:** ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/92142)

[**CAIA Intake Ticket: 35% exemption request from 85/15 reporting requirement form 22-10216**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/92587) 

Note: CAIA can only offer detailed support (e.g. URLs, breadcrumbs, content recommendations, etc.) for pages that are veteran-facing, due to capacity constraints. So the recommendations here are brief.

## <a name="location"></a>Location<br>

- The 85/15 reporting form and the 35% exemption form should live on the [Resources for schools](https://www.va.gov/school-administrators/) page. 
- We recommend following the existing conventions on the [Resources for schools](https://www.va.gov/school-administrators/) page when adding these new forms and form-related content. 


## <a name="header and footer"></a>Header and footer<br>

We generally recomment using the [minimal header](https://design.va.gov/components/header/header-minimal) and [minimal footer](https://design.va.gov/components/footer/footer-minimal) patterns, for child pages of the [Resources for schools](https://www.va.gov/school-administrators/) page.

## <a name="crosslinks"></a>Crosslinks<br>

Information about these forms doesn't need to be cross-linked from any pages in the veteran-facing experience, since the  audience for this info is school administrators, rather than veterans.
