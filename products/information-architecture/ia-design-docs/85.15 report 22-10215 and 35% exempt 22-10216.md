[**IA Review Ticket: 85/15 reporting form 22-10215:** ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/92142)

[**CAIA Intake Ticket: 35% exemption request from 85/15 reporting requirement form 22-10216**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/92587) 

Note: CAIA can only offer detailed support (e.g. URLs, breadcrumbs, content recommendations, etc.) for pages that are veteran-facing, due to capacity constraints. So the recommendations here are brief, and the URL options are more in the spirit of suggestions.


**On this page:**
- [Location](#location)
- [H1 and URL](#H1-and-URL)
- [Header and footer](#header-and-footer)
- [Crosslinks](#crosslinks)


## <a name="location"></a>Location<br>

- The 85/15 reporting form and the 35% exemption form should live on the [Resources for schools](https://www.va.gov/school-administrators/) page. 
- We recommend following the existing conventions for IA, H1 naming, etc. on that page when adding these new forms and form-related content. 

## <a name="H1 and URL"></a>H1 and URL<br>

Refer to the design system's plain language guidance for [page titles and section titles](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/page-titles-and-section-titles) and [URLs](https://design.va.gov/components/url-standards/) when finalizing the form pages' H1s and URLs.

Some suggestions that could work:

35% form
- **H1:** 35% exemption from 85/15 reporting
- **URL:** va.gov/school-administrators/thirty-five-percent-exemption/
- **Breadcrumb:** VA.gov > Resources for schools > 35% exemption
  
85/15 form
- **H1:** 85/15 Rule reporting
- **URL:** va.gov/school-administrators/85-15-rule-reporting/
- **Breadcrumb:** VA.gov > Resources for schools > 85/15 Rule reporting
- *Note: I'm leaning toward '85/15 Rule' rather than '85% Rule' for two reasons. '85/15' seems more commonly used, both around the web and in the VA's own supporting documentation. And '85%' in web results related to the VA is also used in describing individual veteran's disability determinations.*

  
## <a name="header and footer"></a>Header and footer<br>

We generally recomment using the [minimal header](https://design.va.gov/components/header/header-minimal) and [minimal footer](https://design.va.gov/components/footer/footer-minimal) patterns, for child pages of the [Resources for schools](https://www.va.gov/school-administrators/) page.

## <a name="crosslinks"></a>Crosslinks<br>

Information about these forms doesn't need to be cross-linked from any pages in the veteran-facing experience, since the  audience for this info is school administrators, rather than veterans.
