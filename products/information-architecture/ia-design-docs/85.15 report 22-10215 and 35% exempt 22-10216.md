*Note: CAIA can only offer detailed support (e.g. URLs, breadcrumbs, content recommendations, etc.) for pages that are veteran-facing, due to capacity constraints. So the recommendations here are brief, and the URL options are more in the spirit of suggestions.*

## <a name="location-of-forms"></a>Location of forms<br>

- The 85/15 reporting form and the 35% exemption form should live on the [Resources for schools](https://www.va.gov/school-administrators/) page. 
- We recommend following the existing conventions for IA, H1 naming, etc. on that page when adding these new forms and form-related content. 


## <a name="H1 and URL"></a>H1 and URL<br>

Refer to the design system's guidance for [page titles and section titles](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/page-titles-and-section-titles) and [URLs](https://design.va.gov/components/url-standards/) when finalizing the form pages' H1s and URLs.

Some suggestions that could work:

**85/15 form**
- **H1:** Report 85/15 Rule enrollment ratio
- **URL:** va.gov/school-administrators/85-15-reporting/

OR

- **H1:** Submit 85/15 Rule reports
- **URL:** va.gov/school-administrators/submit-85-15-reports/

  
**35% form**
- **H1:** Request 35% exemption from 85/15 reporting
- **URL:** va.gov/school-administrators/request-35-percent-exemption/

*Note on Terminology: I'm leaning toward the term '85/15 Rule' rather than '85% Rule' as the plain language description of this form, for two reasons. '85/15 Rule' is more frequently used, both around the web and in the VA's own supporting documentation. So this is the better option for SEO. In web searches of VA topics, the string '85%' sometimes describe an individual veteran's disability determinations. It would be good to avoid confusion between education admin terminology and descriptions of individual veterans' disability status, where possible.*

*Note on Process: Once the team has finalized H1s and URLs please let CAIA know. We'll do a final check to confirmation that they don't create confusion or conflicts with features in the Veteran and Family Member spaces.*


## <a name="Entry Points"></a>Entry Points<br>
 
**1) Find a VA form** - Add Navigation Link
- Placement description: In the search results for 22-10215 and 22-10216, add navigation links to the Introduction step of the form.
- Link label: Fill out VA Form 22-10215
- Link destination: Introduction step of form-flow
- Notes: The search result for Form 22-10215a should provide a PDF only, since the digital experience of 22-10215a is covered in the 22-10215 form-flow.

**2) 'Not a Veteran?' link** - Keep Current Navigation Link
Benefit hub pages can include a 'Not a Vetran?' section in the main hub page accordion. This provides links to items which are related to the benefit area, but not intended for use by veterans themselves. The [Education and training benefits hub page](https://www.va.gov/education/) already includes a 'Not for Veterans?' section with a link to the [School administrators page](https://www.va.gov/school-administrators/). All needed navigation is in place - no further work required.

## <a name="header and footer"></a>Header and footer<br>

We generally recommend using the [minimal header](https://design.va.gov/components/header/header-minimal) and [minimal footer](https://design.va.gov/components/footer/footer-minimal) patterns, for child pages of the [Resources for schools](https://www.va.gov/school-administrators/) page.


## <a name="crosslinks"></a>Crosslinks<br>

Crosslinks from veteran-facing pages are not needed, since the  audience for this info is school administrators rather than veterans.


## <a name="recirects"></a>Redirects<br>

Redirects are not needed, since pages are only being added (not moved or replaced).
