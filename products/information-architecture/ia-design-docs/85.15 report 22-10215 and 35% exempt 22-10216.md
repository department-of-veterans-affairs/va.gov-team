*Note: CAIA can only offer detailed support (e.g. URLs, breadcrumbs, content recommendations, etc.) for pages that are veteran-facing, due to capacity constraints. So the recommendations here are brief, and the URL options are more in the spirit of suggestions.*

## <a name="location-of-forms"></a>Location of forms<br>

- The 85/15 reporting form and the 35% exemption form should live on the [Resources for schools](https://www.va.gov/school-administrators/) page. 
- We recommend following the existing conventions for IA, H1 naming, etc. on that page when adding these new forms and form-related content. 

## <a name="H1 and URL"></a>H1 and URL<br>

Refer to the design system's guidance for [page titles and section titles](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/page-titles-and-section-titles) and [URLs](https://design.va.gov/components/url-standards/) when finalizing the form pages' H1s and URLs.

Some suggestions that could work:

**85/15 form**
- **H1:** Report 85/15 Rule enrollment ratio
- **URL:** va.gov/school-administrators/85-15-reporting/

OR

- **H1:** Submit 85/15 Rule reports
- **URL:** va.gov/school-administrators/submit-85-15-reports/

*Note: I'm leaning toward the term '85/15 Rule' rather than '85% Rule' as the plain language description of this form, for two reasons. '85/15 Rule' is more frequently used, both around the web and in the VA's own supporting documentation. So this is the better option for SEO. In web searches of VA topics, the string '85%' sometimes describe an individual veteran's disability determinations. It would be good to avoid confusion between education admin terminology and descriptions of individual veterans' disability status, where possible.*

  
**35% form**
- **H1:** Request 35% exemption from 85/15 reporting
- **URL:** va.gov/school-administrators/request-35-percent-exemption/


  
## <a name="header and footer"></a>Header and footer<br>

We generally recomment using the [minimal header](https://design.va.gov/components/header/header-minimal) and [minimal footer](https://design.va.gov/components/footer/footer-minimal) patterns, for child pages of the [Resources for schools](https://www.va.gov/school-administrators/) page.

## <a name="crosslinks"></a>Crosslinks<br>

Information about these forms doesn't need to be cross-linked from any pages in the veteran-facing experience, since the  audience for this info is school administrators, rather than veterans.
