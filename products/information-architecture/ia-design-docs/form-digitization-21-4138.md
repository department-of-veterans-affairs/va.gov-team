## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
*Illustration and/or description of how users will flow through the experience. The user flow helps illustrate how visitors will navigate to and through your product/feature, ensures all types of visitors and scenarios are accounted for, and aids in identifying all content and messaging needs.*

Team's [Mural with user flows](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1694025415991/ed022fe06bade5a04dfc62d6abf1eb249ac496c5?sender=u79ee90295fdb006d7f463212)

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site. This section will also document form or tool flow URLs, titled sub-URLs.*

## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
*A list of new internal entry points, as well as changes to any existing entry points. This list focuses on the primary entry points and does not include all possible crosslinking opportunities. Consider whether a Search Best Bet might be useful if this product enhances a Top Task for veterans.*


1. **[Supporting forms for VA claims](https://www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/)** - Add
  - Placement description: 3rd option up (4138, 0847 and 0972 at the end)
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/submit-statement-form-21-4138
  - Notes: Connecting with Tricia to confirm placement

2. **[About VA Form 21-4138](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-4138/)** - Add
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/submit-statement-form-21-4138
  - Notes: Add to search results as well
 

## <a name="bestbets"></a>Best Bets<br>
*Search “best bets” are suggested pages that appear in the “Our top recommendations for you” section when you perform a search on VA.gov. These suggestions are selected for specific terms and are intended to help veterans and their beneficiaries find relevant results quickly. We want to make sure that best bets are not linking to the deprecated page.*

When you search "buddy statement", 21-4138 form comes up in top 2 search results. Update best bet so form 21-10210 is the top result.

## <a name="stagedrollout"></a>Staged Rollout<br>
*Is the team planning a staged rollout? Pages/sections that can't have a widget: find a form pages, within accordions, hub pages*

**[Which static page has the widget, ie the main entry point?]**
