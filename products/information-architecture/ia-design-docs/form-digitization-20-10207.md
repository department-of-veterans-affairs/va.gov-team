**On this page:**
- [User/page flows](#flows)

- [Entry points](#nav)
- [Crosslinks](#crosslink)
- Redirects
- Best Bets
- [Staged Rollout](#stagedrollout)


## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
*Illustration and/or description of how users will flow through the experience. The user flow helps illustrate how visitors will navigate to and through your product/feature, ensures all types of visitors and scenarios are accounted for, and aids in identifying all content and messaging needs.*

Team documented their [user flow in Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1693514045486/723023ec315ae505d485ef01d4b32e6698af80a5?sender=u79ee90295fdb006d7f463212)!

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*



## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

**1) H1 of page - New**
- URL: www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/request-priority-processing-form-20-10207
- Breadcrumb: VA.gov home > Supporting forms for VA claims > H1 of form page
- Notes: Subsequent pages will add on to the above URL using short and simple labels, i.e. .../introduction/. We can provide further guidance on these additions if needed.

## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
*A list of new internal entry points, as well as changes to any existing entry points. This list focuses on the primary entry points and does not include all possible crosslinking opportunities. Consider whether a Search Best Bet might be useful if this product enhances a Top Task for veterans.*


1. **[Supporting forms page](https://www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/)** - Add
  - Placement description: 6th option down as per current form order
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination:
  - Notes: We connected during content office hours about updating the order of this page based on priority, so we will be ordering based on occurrence documented in the doc type frequency spreadsheet Veteran facing forms team provided. Order can change depending on the remaining forms that will be added to this page and if those are higher priority.

## <a name="crosslink"></a>Crosslinks <br>
*List of additional crosslinking opportunities across VA.gov. This requires stakeholder approval and collaboration with Sitewide Content so this list will be iterative as we get feedback.*

1. **[About VA Form 20-10207](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-20-10207/)** - Add
  - Placement description: Add below “Downloadable PDF”
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination:
  - Notes: Add to search results as well

<img width="400" alt="About VA Form 20-10207" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/122128479/2781be77-2ae0-468c-a6b3-774f3ebcdd3b">

2. **Online Form 21-526EZ** - Modify (paper PDF mentioned only at this time)
  - Placement description: At the end of form flow after folks have submitted form 21-526EZ
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: 
  - Notes: I know the team has already connected with the Benefits Disability team and are in conversation on how to implement this form into the online 21-526EZ disability form. IA has discussed how this might look as more forms are digitized and we want to ensure the least disruptive path so the folks are able to complete the task (form) they are currently on before moving on to the next. We believe adding additional forms related to form 21-526EZ disability form should be added at the end of the form flow after the user has been able to submit.

--------

3. **[The VA claim process after you file your claim](https://www.va.gov/disability/after-you-file-claim/)** - Add
  - Placement description: We suggest adding to this page, but defer to Content and stakeholder's recommendation for link placement
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: 
  - Notes: We suggest adding an entry on this page so Veterans who have already submitted the 21-526EZ disability form. Since there's already a section titled, "How long does it take VA to make a decision?", we defer to Content as well as stakeholders to see if there's any concerns with adding a link to the form under this existing section.

--------

4. **Online Form 21P-527EZ** - Modify (paper PDF mentioned only at this time)
  - Placement description: At the end of form flow after folks have submitted Veterans pension form 21P-527EZ
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination:
  - Notes: This is another form that is already digitized that we believe should link priority processing. Similar to the online experience of disability form 21-526EZ, we want to ensure folks are able to complete the form they're on before moving on to additional forms. The pension form will be reactivated soon so align with the team as they begin working on the next version to include a link to priority processing.

--------

5. **[How to apply for a VA pension as a Veteran](https://www.va.gov/pension/how-to-apply/)** - Add
  - Placement description: Under "How long does it take VA to make a decision?" section
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: 
  - Notes: We noticed the pension benefit hub doesn't have an "After you apply" page so we recommend adding it to the "How to apply" page. Similar reasoning in that there are folks who might have already submitted their claim and are interested in applying to priority processing later due to changes in circumstances that qualify them for this form.

<img width="400" alt="Section in Veterans pension titled How long does it take VA to make a decision" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/122128479/e6e686c2-84c9-4de8-80b0-c22d817cd259">

--------

6. **[VA Survivors Pension](https://www.va.gov/pension/survivors-pension/)** - Add
  - Placement description: Under "How long does it take VA to make a decision?" for static page and at the end of form flow after folks have submitted Survivors pension form 21P-534EZ once form is digitized
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: 
  - Notes: This form isn't currently digitized, but this is another form where we suggest working with that designated team to include a link to priority processing at the end of the form flow. For now, we suggest adding it to the Survivors pension form 21p-534EZ landing page. As mentioned above, there isn't an "After you apply" page in this hub.

--------

7. **Claim Status Tool** - Add
  - Placement description: On the logged-in landing page for the tool
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: 
  - Notes: I know the team has already connected with the Benefits Management team as well. We recommend working with that team to identify where the form link will live on this page.

<img width="400" alt="VA Claim Status Tool landing page" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/122128479/8f79a19a-5e19-4763-9bb7-fb049bf3af6e">

--------

8. **[After you request a decision review](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/after-you-request-review/)** - Add
  - Placement description: We suggest adding to this page, but defer to Content and stakeholder's recommendation for link placement
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: 
  - Notes: Because the priority processing form covers so many claims, we think that adding it here will capture all the decision reviews without adding an entry point in each page. This can also ensure folks who have already submitted their claims can find information on this form if their circumstances changed since their original submission.


## <a name="stagedrollout"></a>Staged Rollout<br>
*Is the team planning a staged rollout? Pages/sections that can't have a widget: find a form pages, within accordions, hub pages*

**[Which static page has the widget, ie the main entry point?]**

This form will be released on a staged rollout. The main entry point will be [Supporting Forms page](https://www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/) and the remainder of the entry points will be implemented after 100%
