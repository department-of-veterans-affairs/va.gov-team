**On this page:**
- [User/page flows](#flows)

- [Entry points](#nav)
- [Crosslinks](#crosslink)
- Redirects
- Best Bets
- [Staged Rollout](#stagedrollout)


## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
*Illustration and/or description of how users will flow through the experience. The user flow helps illustrate how visitors will navigate to and through your product/feature, ensures all types of visitors and scenarios are accounted for, and aids in identifying all content and messaging needs.*

Team documented their [user flow in Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1693514045486/723023ec315ae505d485ef01d4b32e6698af80a5?sender=u79ee90295fdb006d7f463212)!

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

**1) H1 of page - New**
- URL: www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/request-priority-processing-form-20-10207
- Breadcrumb: VA.gov home > Supporting forms for VA claims > H1 of form page
- Notes: Subsequent pages will add on to the above URL using short and simple labels, i.e. .../introduction/. We can provide further guidance on these additions if needed.

## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
*A list of new internal entry points, as well as changes to any existing entry points. This list focuses on the primary entry points and does not include all possible crosslinking opportunities. Consider whether a Search Best Bet might be useful if this product enhances a Top Task for veterans.*


1. **[Supporting forms page](https://www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/)** - Add
  - Placement description: 6th option down as per current form order
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/request-priority-processing-form-20-10207
  - Notes: We connected during content office hours about updating the order of this page based on priority, so we will be ordering based on occurrence documented in the doc type frequency spreadsheet Veteran facing forms team provided. Order can change depending on the remaining forms that will be added to this page and if those are higher priority.

------

2. **[About VA Form 20-10207](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-20-10207/)** - Add
  - Placement description: Add below “Downloadable PDF”
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/request-priority-processing-form-20-10207
  - Notes: Add to search results as well

<img width="400" alt="About VA Form 20-10207" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/122128479/2781be77-2ae0-468c-a6b3-774f3ebcdd3b">

## <a name="crosslink"></a>Crosslinks <br>
*List of additional crosslinking opportunities across VA.gov. This requires stakeholder approval and collaboration with Sitewide Content so this list will be iterative as we get feedback.*


1. **Online Form 21-526EZ** - Modify (only paper PDF is mentioned in the current online application)
  - Placement description: At the end of form flow after folks have submitted form 21-526EZ
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/request-priority-processing-form-20-10207
  - Notes: I know the team has already connected with the Benefits Disability team and are in conversation on how to implement this form into the online 21-526EZ disability form. Ensure the least disruptive path so folks are able to complete the task (form) they are currently on before moving on to the next. We believe adding additional forms related to form 21-526EZ disability form should be added at the end of the form flow after the user has been able to submit. With these crosslinks, connect with the team to determine technical and information complexity.

--------

2. **Online Form 21P-527EZ** - Modify (only paper PDF is mentioned in the current online application)
  - Placement description: At the end of form flow after folks have submitted Veterans pension form 21P-527EZ
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/request-priority-processing-form-20-10207
  - Notes: This is another form that is already digitized that we believe should link priority processing. Similar to the online experience of disability form 21-526EZ, we want to ensure folks are able to complete the form they're on before moving on to additional forms. The pension form will be reactivated soon so align with the team as they begin working on the next version to include a link to priority processing.

--------

3. **Claim Status Tool** - Add
  - Placement description: On the logged-in landing page for the tool
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/request-priority-processing-form-20-10207
  - Notes: I know the team has already connected with the Benefits Management team as well. We recommend working with that team to identify where the form link will live on this page.

-------

4. **Decision Reviews** - Add
  - Link destination: www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/request-priority-processing-form-20-10207
  - Notes: Once the product team knows which decision reviews can be used with 20-10207, connect with the decision reviews team to determine where this form can be crosslinked within the online application.

-------
5. **[Types of VA disability claims and when to file](https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/when-to-file/)** - Add
  - Placement description: Under section "Programs to help speed up your claim decision"
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/request-priority-processing-form-20-10207
  - Notes: The forms team flagged this page as a potential crosslink opportunity. Content team will review this page further as part of adding any 
    other crosslinks.

## <a name="stagedrollout"></a>Staged Rollout<br>
*Is the team planning a staged rollout? Pages/sections that can't have a widget: find a form pages, within accordions, hub pages*

This form will be released on a staged rollout. The main entry point will be [Supporting Forms page](https://www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/) and the remainder of the entry points will be implemented after 100%
