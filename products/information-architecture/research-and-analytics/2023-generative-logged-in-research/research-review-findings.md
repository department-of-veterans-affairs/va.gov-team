# Identifying issues and challenges people have finding tasks when they are signed in to VA.gov: Research Review Findings

Liz Lantz, Authenticated Experience

Additional updates and notes by Samara Strauss, Auth experience PO

Last updated: April 26, 2023

## Background
We’re aware of some high-level problems people have navigating the logged in experience on VA.gov — eg. if a link isn’t on the homepage or My VA, people tend to have trouble finding what they need. However, we’ve never conducted more holistic research that evaluates navigating the logged in experience. 

This research review is the first of 7 research activities we’ll do to dive deeper into users’ problems with and expectations around navigating VA.gov once they’re signed in.

## Goals

There were two main goals for this review:

1. **Determine what we already know** - This includes any known challenges with navigating the logged in experience (eg. people being reliant on homepage and My VA links); Veteran top tasks that we've already seen demonstrated through research and analytics; and known expectations around the logged in experience (eg. it should be personalized).
2. **Determine what we need more information on** - This includes documenting any findings that we'd like to gather more information; documenting thoughts on how we can potentially explore findings further; and determining outstanding questions.

## Research questions and findings

### Signing in to VA.gov
The majority of the studies we looked at didn’t include findings around signing in to VA.gov that are relevant to this research (mentions of sign-in were usually around the actual sign in process, which isn’t in scope). Signing in came up in all 3 homepage research studies, but it would be helpful to get more information about this topic.

#### When do people sign in to VA.gov? 
Only one study had insights into this question: the homepage redesign usability study, round 1 ([finding 4](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md#4-most-sign-ins-didnt-happen-on-the-home-page-with-sign-in-or-create-an-account-near-the-photos-or-sign-in-in-the-header)).
- Most sign-ins didn’t happen on the home page (with “Sign in or create an account” near the photos or “Sign in” in the header).
- 5 of 19 participants said that they’d **sign in first—before using the home page**—so they’d see customized links or wouldn’t get interrupted later to sign in and then have to figure out how to get back to where they were.
	
#### Do they intend to sign in first thing, or only after finding a page that tells them they need to sign in?
Only one study had insights into this question: the homepage redesign usability study, round 2 ([finding 6](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/2022-09-redesign-usability-round2/research-findings.md#2-many-participants-got-stuck-on-some-of-the-tasks-and-when-that-happened-most-didnt-try-to-use-search)).
- 6 of 11 participants said they would sign in before completing any tasks.
> “You will need to sign in, so why not sign in first. I don’t know how to do it without signing in. This feels backward since you need to sign in anyways" (p1).

> ”Once you login, everything is easier to find information" (p4, who signs in first every time they goes to VA.gov).

**Outstanding question**: When do people login in a given flow (eg. right away, after finding a prompt in a content page, etc)?

#### Are people able to find prompts to sign in easily?
- In the baseline wayfinding usability study  [wayfinding Issues, 1.iv](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-report.md#wayfinding-issues), **3 people missed the call to action button** under “Please sign in to view your VA medical records” 
- Making the sign in CTA more prominent didn’t necessarily make it easier for people to sign in.
> Most participants didn’t click *either* “sign in” button on the homepage. Of those who chose to sign in from the home page, only 2 participants used the new “sign in” button, whereas four used the original “sign in” button in the header. All other participants (13) instead used “sign in” buttons on content pages. [Homepage Redesign Round 1 Usability Testing, Hypothesis and conclusions, 1 and 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md#hypotheses-and-conclusions)

**Outstanding question**: What sign in CTA(s) do people use (homepage, content page, main nav), and how easily they find these prompts?

**Outstanding question**: Does "sign in" or "create an account" make a difference?
	
### Navigating to tasks & tools

#### What are the known challenges do people have navigating the logged in experience (eg. reliance on homepage/My VA links)?
1. People get frustrated navigating links that are not relevant to them, or feel like the website is generic rather than personalized to them.
	- [My VA 2.0 2020 Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md#people-want-a-task-based-logged-in-homepage-tailored-to-them)
	- [Action items discovery, finding 3](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications/2021-action-items-discovery/research/alerts-discovery-research-summary.md#key-findings)
	- [Mobile App IA Usability, Detailed Findings, question 6.ii.a](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/usability-testing/new%20navigation%20usability/usability-findings.md#detailed-findings)

**Outstanding question**: Do people feel the site is only too generic when they are logged-in (assuming yes)? What level of personalization do they expect in the navigation?

2. There is some ambiguity/confusion around navigating things related to financial information, but the label “Payments” is generally pretty clear and aligns with what people expect to see there.
	- 	[Health Hub Tree Test Finding 5](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2022-07-health-apt-tree-test-round1/HH_ResearchFindings.pdf) reveals that navigating things related to financial information is somewhat confusing. Identifying where and why cost, debt, and payment related content and tools was difficult, and there were multiple instances of confusion as to why copay and travel reimbursement were together.
	- In the [Mobile App Open Card Sort study (finding 5)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/open%20card%20sort/Card-sort-research-report.md), people created a payment category that include all financial things *except* anything related to Education benefits - they wanted those to stay separately.  
3. It’s hard for people to find what they need if it’s not on the homepage.
	- In the [My VA 2.0 2020 analytics review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#most-people-start-directly-on-the-homepage-but-some-people-reorient-themselves-their-throughout-their-session), we learned people have to reorient themselves on the homepage. This is likely due to the lack of a cohesive logged-in navigation. 
	- In the baseline wayfinding usability study [wayfinding Issues, 1.i](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-report.md#wayfinding-issues), we saw that participants relied on browsing the homepage over using search to find things they were looking for:
> Most participants didn’t use search and instead tried browsing elsewhere on the home page. Only 4 of 19 participants searched when they couldn’t find what they were looking for in “common tasks. -  [Homepage Redesign Round 1 Usability Testing, Hypothesis and conclusions, 5](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md#hypotheses-and-conclusions)
			
#### How easy/hard is it to find tasks that require people to be logged in?
1. People are easily able to find tasks that require them to be logged in when:
- they are linked from the homepage or My VA (Baseline wayfinding on VA.gov,   [details of findings, 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-report.md#details-of-findings))
- they have succinct labels, and are task-oriented. 
	- Health hub tree test, [finding 3](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2022-07-health-apt-tree-test-round1/HH_ResearchFindings.pdf)
	- [VA mobile app - IA & Navigation project summary, page 15](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-design/information-architecture-navigation/2023%20VA%20Mobile%20App%20-%20IA%20%26%20Navigation%20Project%20Summary.pdf)	
- There is scannable list of sections and tools, such as in [the blue sky prototype sidebar navigation](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/console/share/X3WBOA3QSWR), or the top 4 boxes on the homepage. 
	- This is supported in the [My VA 2.0 2020 Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md#the-homepage-needs-to-be-supported-by-a-cohesive-logged-in-navigation) as well as (Baseline wayfinding on VA.gov,   [details of findings, 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-report.md#details-of-findings)). 
	- In the second round of the homepage redesign usability research, participants commented on how hard it was to find links in a long page of content (read [second bullet in “Out of scope” findings section](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/2022-09-redesign-usability-round2/research-findings.md#out-of-scope-for-home-page-redesign)).
	- The VA mobile app team tested a basic set of navigation items that gives users a clear sense of all main section of the app and quickly navigate between them, and their nav structure tested very well with 13 participants.  [2023 VA mobile app - IA & Navigation project summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-design/information-architecture-navigation/2023%20VA%20Mobile%20App%20-%20IA%20%26%20Navigation%20Project%20Summary.pdf)	

	
**Outstanding question**: Is the problem with navigation the main nav, lengthy content pages (assume CTA is not on My VA or homepage), or both (or something else)?

2. Labels impact how easy/hard it is for people to find tasks:
- It’s harder for people to understand labels that are overly verbose or break to multiple lines. For example: “Manage your electronic record sharing options,” (Health hub tree test[finding 3](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2022-07-health-apt-tree-test-round1/HH_ResearchFindings.pdf))	
- The homepage redesign research recommends making sure labels are task-oriented rather than topic - oriented (Homepage redesign research, round two ([recommendation 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/2022-09-redesign-usability-round2/research-findings.md#for-the-home-page-redesign-effort))
	- However, the IA and nav structure presented in the [VA mobile app - IA & Navigation project summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-design/information-architecture-navigation/2023%20VA%20Mobile%20App%20-%20IA%20%26%20Navigation%20Project%20Summary.pdf)	 shows people had overwhelming success navigating simple, non-task oriented navigation labels.
3. Updating personal information is intuitive when it’s in the profile.
	- 	[Mobile App IA Usability, Detailed Findings, Question 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/usability-testing/new%20navigation%20usability/usability-findings.md#detailed-findings)
4. With each round of testing for the homepage ([baseline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-report.md), [round 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md#3-of-the-20-top-tasks-tested-9-tasks-were-completed-successfully-by-everyone-and-4-were-completed-by-only-half-of-those-who-tried-them), and [round 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/2022-09-redesign-usability-round2/research-findings.md#3-compared-to-the-previous-round-of-usability-testing-5-tasks-performed-better-and-1-fared-worse-in-successful-completions)) it became increasingly difficult for people to complete the task of messaging their doctor.  A contributing factor to this is that people are used to doing this on My HealtheVet and didn’t know they could do it from VA.gov.
5. People used the search bar as their first step when looking for their military information from the profile ([profile military info research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information/discovery-and-research/2023-military-info-discovery/topline-summary.md#when-asked-to-show-me-where-theyd-expect-to-find-their-military-info-on-vagov-starting-from-the-my-va-screen-participants-mostly-went-to-the-search-bar-as-their-first-step))

#### What tasks do people come to complete?
The  [My VA 2.0 2020 Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md#health-care-and-disability-benefits-are-king) calls out health and disability tasks, seeing information about active benefits and downloading or looking for documents  as top tasks. Those findings were based on analytics and research conducted prior to that 2020 study. 

Only one of the other studies reviewed included findings with qualitative data about people’s intentions on VA.gov - the rest had pre-determined tasks.  The Digital Health Modernization Generative Research Study 1 called out that participants used and valued the top 4 tools on My HealtheVet: pharmacy, appointments, messaging, and records ([Insight 6](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/pre-mhv-prototype/generative-research-study-1/research-findings.md#insight-6-the-mhv-homepage-tools-reflect-users-top-health-care-tasks)).
	
The mobile app open card sort ([finding 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/open%20card%20sort/Card-sort-research-report.md)) called out that depending on where the Veteran is in the Veteran journey, they find different services important.

#### What are other known insights around navigating the site overall?
1. People will want information about getting benefits (vs managing) regardless of if they are logged in or not.
	- Mission-critical “Get Benefits” content would benefit from multiple paths, elevation in the IA, and more direct navigation (Health hub tree test [finding 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2022-07-health-apt-tree-test-round1/HH_ResearchFindings.pdf))	
	- The logged-in homepage needs to scale to support all phases of the Veteran lifecycle ( [My VA 2.0 2020 Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md#the-logged-in-homepage-needs-to-scale-to-support-every-phase-of-the-veteran-lifecycle))

**Outstanding question**: Does the homepage need to exist in a logged-in state? Can My VA replace it?

2. It’s important to have a clear delineation between tasks around “getting benefits” and “managing benefits”. [Health hub tree test recommendations](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2022-07-health-apt-tree-test-round1/HH_ResearchFindings.pdf)	

**Outstanding question**: Does this hold up when we add the layer of a visual navigation on top of a tree test? Is the delineation about "Get" and "Manage", or something else?

3. Users want multiple ways of getting to the same information.
	- [Health Hub Tree Test Finding 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2022-07-health-apt-tree-test-round1/HH_ResearchFindings.pdf)	
	- [My VA 2.0 Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md#veterans-want-new-information-to-be-clear-to-them-when-they-log-in-and-expect-to-receive-new-information-through-multiple-channels)
	- [Action items discovery, Central Alerts finding 4](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/action-items-discovery/research/alerts-discovery-research-summary.md#central-alerts-page-1)
	- [Mobile App Open Card Sort, Finding 8](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/open%20card%20sort/Card-sort-research-report.md)
	- In the homepage redesign usability testing ([round 1, finding 3](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md#3-of-the-20-top-tasks-tested-9-tasks-were-completed-successfully-by-everyone-and-4-were-completed-by-only-half-of-those-who-tried-them)), we saw participants take very different paths to complete the same thing. The study also [recommends that we ensure all top tasks can be accomplished via searching *and* browsing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md#beyond-the-home-page-out-of-scope-but-can-discuss-with-other-teams)
4. Increased depth of hierarchy (ex: Claims being under Benefits) does not necessarily negatively impact people’s perception of ease of use/navigation. In fact, subcategories may improve clarity and better align to Veteran’s mental models.
	- [Mobile App IA Usability, Finding 4](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/usability-testing/new%20navigation%20usability/usability-findings.md#study-tasks) 
	- [Mobile app closed card sort, recommendations](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/closed%20card%20sort/closed-card-sort-research-report.md#we-recommend-the-following-changes-to-the-high-level-ia-to-improve-clarity-between-categories-and-better-match-participants-mental-models)
	- [2023 VA mobile app IA and Navigation project summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-design/information-architecture-navigation/2023%20VA%20Mobile%20App%20-%20IA%20%26%20Navigation%20Project%20Summary.pdf)
5. Visual indicators, such as a red dot for alerts, combined with clear labeling make it easy for people to understand something needs their attention.
	- [Action items discovery, Central Alerts finding 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/action-items-discovery/research/alerts-discovery-research-summary.md#central-alerts-page-1)

**Outstanding question**: What other wayfinding methods besides navigational terms should we consider?

6. The mobile app IA (which is similar to VA.gov) is easy and intuitive for people to navigate and learn, even when they’re brand-new to the app.
	- [Mobile App IA Usability, Key Findings 1 and 3, and Detailed Findings, Question 3](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/usability-testing/new%20navigation%20usability/usability-findings.md#study-tasks)
	- [2023 VA mobile app IA and Navigation project summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-design/information-architecture-navigation/2023%20VA%20Mobile%20App%20-%20IA%20%26%20Navigation%20Project%20Summary.pdf)

**Outstanding question**: Is using the mobile app nav as a model for VA.gov a good idea? Given the inherent difference in these mediums, where is the line between how they should be similar and how they should and need to differ?

#### What are other known insights around navigating the logged in experience/tasks you have to log into to do?
1. People find it helpful to have all their tasks/links in one place, and when they log in. 
	- [Action items discovery, finding 1 and 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/action-items-discovery/research/alerts-discovery-research-summary.md#key-findings)
	- In the [My VA 2.0 2020 Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md#veterans-expect-a-mix-of-links-and-widgets-to-complete-tasks-from-their-homepage) we heard that people don’t mind being presented with many links if they take them to the right place.
2. It’s not intuitive for people to look under something called “My” for things they don’t have yet
> While “My Health” provided an intuitive go-to location for “Manage” tasks, it was often not considered for “Get” content and tasks - [Health Hub Tree Test Finding 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2022-07-health-apt-tree-test-round1/HH_ResearchFindings.pdf)
3. Once people find a way of navigating that works for them, they tend to stick to it. Findings from both [round 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md) and [round 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/2022-09-redesign-usability-round2/research-findings.md) of the homepage redesign research support this. 

## What do we not know at this point? 

1. What do people without accounts do when they try to accomplish a task that requires one?
- The [homepage redesign research (round 2)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/2022-09-redesign-usability-round2/research-findings.md#further-research-needed) calls this out as something to do more research on.
2. What are expectations do people have who are *not* Veterans around a personalized va.gov experience?
- The Digital Health Modernization Generative Study noted that “the inability to delineate actions between users of a single MHV account causes friction and confusion.” ([Insight 8](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/pre-mhv-prototype/generative-research-study-1/research-findings.md#insight-8-the-inability-to-delineate-actions-between-users-of-a-single-mhv-account-causes-friction-and-confusion)). 
- VSO's had a hard time finding Connected Apps in the [Representative OAuth and Connected Apps Research Report](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/lighthouse-ux/tree/master/Developer%20Platform%20Research/2023-03-Representative%20OAuth%20and%20Connected%20Apps%20Research%20Report_with%20VSOs)

**Outstanding question**: How do needs and expectations around moving through VA.gov differ between user types (eg. veterans vs. service members vs. families/caregivers/dependents)?

## What would be helpful to get more information on?

### Liz's recommendations

1. More information about signing in will be useful.  While previous studies had a few insights related to our question, none of these studies really focused on learning about this.  Each of these questions were answered in one study
	- When do people sign sign in to VA.gov?
	- Do they they intend to sign in right way, or only after they encounter a CTA?
2. What are peoples expectations from search when they’re already logged in?
> “I rely on a good search box. HC has so many shades of gray which makes it difficult” - from the [Health Hub Tree Test Finding 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2022-07-health-apt-tree-test-round1/HH_ResearchFindings.pdf)
- “Veterans aren’t using all of the current search and browse tools on VA.gov. Most participants were focused on the “top 4” boxes most of the time, with limited exploration of the header and links below.” - [Baseline Wayfinding on VA.gov, Hypothesis 3](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-report.md#hypotheses)
- “No participants started with site search (in the header of the home page), but about half went there when they were unable to find any relevant links elsewhere on the home page” - [Baseline Wayfinding on VA.gov, Wayfinding Issues, 3](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-report.md#wayfinding-issues)
- “Most participants browsed without using search” - [Homepage redesign usability testing, Round 1, Key finding 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md#1-most-participants-browsed-clicking-links-without-using-the-search-box-at-all-or-searched-only-when-browsing-didnt-work)
3. How important is it to differentiate between signing in and creating an account in calls to actions?
> Most participants in this research were accustomed to using the “Sign in” button in the header to access the account they already have, and some were confused by seeing a second button. - From [Homepage redesign usability testing, Round 1, Recommendation 4](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md#for-the-home-page-redesign-effort)
4. What kind of learning curve will we need to account for when people need to use VA.gov to complete tasks typically done on My HealtheVet? 
- The Digital Health Modernization Generative Research Study 1 ([Insight 3](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/pre-mhv-prototype/generative-research-study-1/research-findings.md#insight-3-veterans-and-caregivers-dont-go-to-vagov-to-do-health-tasks)) called out that participants struggled to complete health tasks that took them out of MHV, including scheduling appointments
5. If we need more data to define the tasks people come to VA.gov to complete, we should do additional research to confirm the My VA 2.0 2020 research. The studies reviewed as part of this effort primarily included pre-determined tasks that don’t dig into what people are coming to VA.gov for when they’re not in a research session.

### Summary of Samara's outstanding questions

1. When do people login in a given flow (eg. right away, after finding a prompt in a content page, etc)?
2. What sign in CTA(s) do people use (homepage, content page, main nav), and how easily they find these prompts?
3. Does "sign in" or "create an account" make a difference?
4. Do people feel the site is only too generic when they are logged-in (assuming yes)? What level of personalization do they expect in the navigation?
5. Is the problem with navigation the main nav, lengthy content pages (assume CTA is not on My VA or homepage), or both (or something else)?
6. Does the homepage need to exist in a logged-in state? Can My VA replace it?
7. Does "Get" and "Manage" delineation hold up when we add the layer of a visual navigation on top of a tree test? 
8. What other wayfinding methods besides navigational terms should we consider (eg. alert indicators)?
9. Is using the mobile app nav as a model for VA.gov a good idea? Given the inherent difference in these mediums, where is the line between how they should be similar and how they should and need to differ?
10. How do needs and expectations around moving through VA.gov differ between user types (eg. veterans vs. service members vs. families/caregivers/dependents)?
