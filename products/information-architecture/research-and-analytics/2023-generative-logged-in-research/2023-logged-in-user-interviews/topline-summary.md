# Topline Summary for Logged-in IA and Nav Wayfinding Study
 April 4, 2023

This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is **not the final result of working with the data discovered**. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes.

## Initial Findings
### Participants heavily relied on the homepage to navigate VA.gov, and My VA to a lesser degree.
- After signing in, people looked for the link to their task on My VA, or the homepage.
- They continued to return to the homepage, mostly using the site breadcrumbs.
- A couple of participants returned to My VA via the link in the navigation (not the personalized menu) instead of the homepage to look for additional links.

### When asked to find content without using links on the homepage or My VA, about half of the participants used the mega menu, and the other half used search.
- Participants who used the mega menu easily found what they were looking for, when links were surfaced at the second level. It was harder for people to find what they’re looking if the link wasn’t called out in the menu and they had to go to a content page.
- When the mega menu failed, most people used search.
- Search worked well for most people who used it.
- A screenreader participant used Google search over navigation or VA.gov search, and found what they were looking for immediately, every time.

### All participants logged-in as a first step when they got to the website.
- They all expected to have to log in to see personalized information, and most did so via the sign-in button in the header. 
- A couple of participants started on My HealtheVet and got logged out when going to VA.gov, and then signed in from a content page CTA after being prompted by the moderator.
- Some participants defaulted to starting on My HealtheVet; they signed in immediately there as well, but the logged-in state didn’t persist when they got to VA.gov due to the type of credential they used.

### Participants who were not able to find what they were looking for stated they would call VA to get help.
3 of 10 participants were not able to find what they were looking for, and stated they would call VA to complete their task.

### Most participants clearly understood that “logged in / authenticated” parts of the website were all about them, and the unauthenticated parts of the website were generic and targeted toward everyone.
- Multiple participants referred the personalized menu, My VA, and My HealtheVet as “my stuff” or “everything about me”.
- Participants understood that content available via the navigation menus was for all Veterans or potential VA beneficiaries. Most felt it was appropriate to have that content, and that it should be a accessible even though they were logged in.
- One participant stated they the menus were personalized because they used the word “your” in the links.
- Most did not differentiate or comment on the homepage content being personalized or not. One participant referred to the homepage as a “dashboard” and felt it was personalized because it used the word “your”.
- No one expressed frustration or confusion by encountering content that wasn’t personalized to them, though some did get frustrated when they didn’t find personalized content where they expected it. They commented that it would be nice to have a link to personalized content, or that the link “should” be there.

### Participants struggled to find dependent information, which wasn’t linked from the homepage, My VA, or the mega menu links.
- About half of the participants expected to find it in the profile, and navigated there via the personalized menu.
- Participants who had dependents for their compensation understood dependents were related to disability benefits, so they were less sure about whether it would be in a personalized page (they checked the My VA Payments section) or somewhere under the disability section of the benefit hub.
- 3 participants were not able to find the information.
- 7 participants found it by using search.
- 2 participants were looking for the term DEERS to help them verify dependents on file with VA.

### When asked how the logged-in experience of VA.gov compared to other websites they log in to, most participants said it was “okay”.
- Participants considered their banking website as an example when we asked this question.
- They commented that other websites they log into are more personalized, and all about them as soon as they’re logged in.
- 2 participants described the VA.gov logged-in experience as “cumbersome”
- We can do better than “okay”.

### Authenticating across multiple sites created a fractured experience, and made some participants feel frustrated or hesitant.
- Multiple participants shared frustration and/or confusion during the log in process, especially those who started on My HealtheVet and logged in with a MHV credential.
- We observed participants having to log in multiple times while searching for personalized information.
- One participant didn’t use the site navigation at all during the session.  When asked why, they stated it partially because they didn’t want to “click anything up there because it might sign me out again”
