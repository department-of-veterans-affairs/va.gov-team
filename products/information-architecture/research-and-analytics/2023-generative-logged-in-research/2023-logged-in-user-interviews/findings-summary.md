## Research Goals
Our goal with this research was to identify problems and expectations with navigating the logged-in experience on VA.gov.

## Research Questions
### Navigation and wayfinding
* How do people navigate to tasks they came to VA.gov to complete? 
	* How do they navigate to those tasks without relying on homepage/My VA links?
* How do people navigate to personalized information?
- What do people do when they:
	- have trouble with the website
	- feel information is inaccurate
	- need help with something
	- can’t find what they need
	- have questions in general
* How can we make the site easier to navigate for logged-in users?

### Logged-in mental model and expectations
* What are people’s expectations of the website experience after they’ve logged in?
* How do people differentiate “logged in / authenticated” parts of the website, and “unauthenticated” parts of the website? 
* Does the current experience cause confusion?
* How do navigation needs and expectations differ between user types (Veterans, caregivers, and family members)?

## Methodology 
We conducted sessions remotely via Zoom, using screen sharing to observe participants completing tasks related to their VA benefits. 
- 8 of 9 participants could recall tasks they had recently done online related to their VA benefits or services, and we asked them to demonstrate how they did that in the session.
- 1 participant, a Veteran’s family member, had never used a VA website to access benefits or services, so we asked them to go through tasks related to their Veteran’s benefits and services, as if they needed to do them on their behalf.
- If participants used a link from the homepage or My VA to get to their task, they were asked to show us how they would get there if the link wasn’t directly on that page. 
- 1 participant was not able to screen share, so their session was conducted verbally.

**Note:** During this testing, VA.gov was piloting a new version of the homepage, and a new health landing page.  Our participants were not exposed to either of these during our study. We tested with the current version of the homepage, and the My HealtheVet links on the site pointed to the My HealtheVet website.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions
1. People will struggle finding what they’re looking for if they can’t use the homepage or My VA.

  	- **Likely false:** While people used links from both pages to quickly navigate to their tasks, most were still able to use the mega menu or search to find what they were looking for.  People struggled when the thing they were looking for wasn’t surfaced on the homepage, My VA, or in the mega menu.
2. People will give up or call VA if they can’t find what they need on VA.gov.

	- **Likely true:**  Less than half (4 of 9) of our participants were not able to find what they needed during the session, and stated they would call VA, or take a break and try again later.
3. People’s expectations of a logged-in VA.gov experience will not be much different than the current experience.
	- **Maybe false:** Most participants shared a sentiment that their logged-in experience on VA.gov was acceptable, but had suggestions for increased personalization. They also articulated feeling a stronger sense of personalization and task-based focused on other websites they log into.
4. Navigation needs and expectations will be similar across user types.

	- **Likely false:** 2 participants were totally unfamiliar with VA.gov and were not able to find task-related information on the website. 7 participants had previous experience and were able to find the same information much more easily.

## Key Findings

## Details of Findings 
### Though participants had different approaches to starting their journey, everyone logged in as a first step when they got to the website.
- 5 participants started directly on VA.gov.
	- All 5 typed the web address directly into the browser.
	- 4 of 5 quickly went directly to their task via My VA.
- 3 participants started on My HealtheVet (MHV).
	- All used a phrase in a search engine to find the MHV website.
	- All had to be directed to VA.gov by the moderator.
- 1 participant started on eBenefits.
	- They used a browser bookmark for eBenefits.
	- They had to be directed to VA.gov by the moderator.
	
Everyone expected to have to log in to see personalized information, and 7 of 9 did so via the sign-in button in the header.  
- No one had to be prompted by the moderator to sign in.
- To prepare for the session, 2 participants had already logged in when screen sharing began, so we could not tell what the clicked to log in.

### Participants relied on the homepage and My VA to navigate less than we expected; instead they used a variety of methods to get to their tasks.
8 of 9 participants started their session with a task that was linked from the homepage or My VA, and it was no surprise that they used that link to quickly get to where they wanted to go.  When we asked them to find another way to get to the same information, and to complete other tasks later in the session, we saw variations in how people navigated the website.

4 of 9 primarily used the mega menu to navigate, with site search as a back-up for tasks that were hard to find, like viewing dependents.  The ease with which people navigated with the menu depended on the context they had around their task, and if the task was surfaced in the second layer of the menu. 

<img src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/images/open-mega-menu.png" alt="VA.gov health and benefits menu expanded" width="500" />

_Above: image of the VA.gov Healthcare navigation menu open, with a focus ring around a link in the center column_

Based on what we observed, the less familiar a person was with VA.gov, the more they relied on the homepage or My VA to navigate. 4 of 9 participants repeatedly returned to the homepage or My VA as a way to get to their tasks.
- P9 returned to the homepage via breadcrumbs or their back button
- P7 and P3 used the My VA link in the global heading, though P3 confused My VA and MHV, and did not intend to go to My VA.
- P6 continued to return to the VA.gov homepage through the “Benefits” link on the MHV homepage.
- P3 and P6 were very unfamiliar with VA.gov, as well as any services other than health care. They moved around the site with a lot of hesitation, or not at all.

> Moderator: How would you find that information without the link on [My VA]? 
> 
> P3: I wouldn’t do anything. I would immediately say to myself check up here *clicks personalized menu,* where it takes me to [My HealtheVet], and no other thought would come to my mind. I would never go on this site [VA.gov].

The 2 participants who relied on the homepage didn’t see My VA until the end of their session, when directed by the moderator. Both had positive reactions and felt My VA would have gotten them to where they wanted to go.

> I’d probably be able to find exactly what I was looking for [on My VA], without going through all these different things down here *mouses over links on homepage* - P6

1 of 9 participants, a screenreader user, preferred to use Google searches over other navigation methods. 
> There's a lot of stuff up there in the header that I try to avoid, like the headings and the menu, as much as possible, because of the amount of detail that's up there. A lot of times, it's just easier to do a search for it and get around that area. Otherwise, I’m not sure if I'll be clicking two or three levels past the initial heading point to find the item. - P2


### Navigating to tasks was challenging for participants who weren’t sure how their task was categorized within VA. 
Participants had a harder time finding what they needed via the navigation menu when: 
	- there could be multiple related categories (e.g. downloading benefit letters), or 
	- they didn't have enough context around the task (e.g. viewing dependents) 

Participants who tried to search for content had a 50% success rate finding what they needed; in some cases they struggled to find a keyword so their search produced no helpful results.

When participants clearly understood the category for their task, they had no problem using the navigation menus or generating helpful search results.

### Participants who were not able to find what they were looking for stated they would contact VA to get help.
3 of 10 participants were not able to find what they were looking for (view dependents), and stated they would contact VA to complete their task. As a secondary approach, one of the 3 said they might try google searching, and another said they might try again another time.

> Caregiver: I guess we failed, because I don’t know how we’d check that.
> 
> P1: Many times when I can’t find something, I’ll use secure messaging or call my VIST [Visual Impairment Services Team] coordinator. He’s good on the computer and he’ll point me in the right direction.

### Participants perceived authenticated parts of VA.gov as being personalized to them, and unauthenticated parts of the website as general information for anyone visiting the site.
All participants understood authenticated parts of VA.gov (My VA, profile, and various tools they encountered) were personalized to them. They called out specific things such as their claim status, appointments, the name tag content, and name in the global header as signifiers that they were logged-in and seeing personalized information.

> This is *my* VA. This is stuff that the VA is giving me, how the VA cares for me, the benefits that I get. - P7

> I’m looking for whether it’s my name, my disability percentage, my medications, my physicians name, I’m looking for that familiar thing to say, ‘ok you’re in the right place’. - P9

<img src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/images/my-va-staging-account.png" alt="Screenshot of My VA with personalized menu open and personalized content highlighted in red" width="500" />

*Above: Screenshot of a test user’s My VA page, showing their name, disability rating, personalized menu, and claim status.*

We asked participants to complete two tasks that required them to be logged in, and would take them to pages that don’t require authentication. Participants understood that navigation menus led to content for all Veterans or potential VA beneficiaries, and a few talked about the value in having access to that general information to learn about benefits. 

> VA is not trying to be a seller of new customers; it’s a tool for people who are eligible to their entitlement to be able to access and get into it. Those are two completely different types of situations and paradigms. We’re consumers of the services, we’re not customers…if we have two extremely separate sides of the VA, internal vs external…it gets hard to figure out where you’re trying to go because you’re looking at two completely different portals, and that does become confusing. That’s where it becomes kind of nice to have similar structures in place. - P2

However, as they tried to complete tasks, they wanted more specific, personalized information or links on those content pages.

> I would like to be specific when I’m applying for anything. I felt that, ‘does this really apply to me as well’? Even though I fall into the spectrum of disability, how does that interact with my caregiver benefit? That is where, it was just not giving me that specific information, and that’s why I didn’t feel confident. - P15, trying to understand how other benefits apply to a participant in the VA Caregiver Program

> When I went to education and employment. It talked about GI Bill, but they should know if I’ve already redeemed such and what other educational benefits I might be entitled to. - P5, reflecting on education pages


### Participants struggled to find dependent information, which wasn’t linked from the homepage, My VA, or the mega menu links.
We asked 8 of 9 participants to show us how they would double check if VA had any dependents on file for them (1 participant did not have time for this task in their session). All 8 struggled to find this information, and 4 were not able to complete the task.

- 3 confidently checked their profile first, expecting to find their dependents listed there. These 3 participants had varying levels of familiarity with the website. They also all receive disability compensation from VA, so are more likely to correlate dependents with disability than Veterans who do not receive this benefit.
- 2 participants tried looking under “Family member benefits”.
- 1 looked under “Service member benefits”.
- 2 participants were scanning pages for the term DEERS (Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, a system used for Tricare beneficiaries), thinking that would help them find the information.
- 2 successfully used search because they weren’t sure how else to find it.

> That should be under my profile, or in one of these things here *mousing over My VA sections* because it is basic information about who is loaded. For me, *hesitates,* for disability I get it for my spouse… I don’t know if it would be under disability. *Scrolling up and down My VA* Yeah, I don’t know. 
> 
> *Eventually finds View Dependents page via search*
> 
> That was very painful, and it should not be that hard to find. - P7

### 5 of 9 participants talked about redundancies and complexities while navigating the VA website after logging-in.
When reviewing the personalized menu, 2 participants called out the redundancy of having My VA and My HealtheVet linked there, and in the global header. They didn’t have a preference about where the links should live if they were only shown once.

> Just have the sign out button here and get rid of all these other options [in personalized menu], Or get rid of all these other buttons [in global header], and make this [personalized menu] worth something. I don’t know.  There’s not a lot of choices there. - P7

2 screenreader users we interviewed talked about how simplifying the logged-in navigation would make it easier to navigate the site. One completely avoided using the navigation based on previous experiences on the website.

> It [navigation menu] is nicely organized. I’m not faulting the VA on that. You could strip away a couple of the layers to streamline things a little bit…but when it comes to the screenreader there’s a whole lot up there you need to navigate through. - P2

The other screenreader user talked about preferring a streamlined menu after logging in, where priority would be given to personalized items, with a single jumping off point to more general information.

> Thinking about being a person that uses a screenreader, I do wish that some of these menus were a little more streamlined and more straightforward. So if there was a way - if you’re not logged in, you see the general menu, but then if you are logged in, [accessing] the more general information just from the personalized menu. - P15

### My VA contributed to a sense of ease and personalization for participants who used it during their session.
At the conclusion of our session, we asked participants to reflect their VA.gov experience compared to another website they log into regularly to complete tasks; many referred to their banking website (e-commerce and insurance websites came up too). Participants described private sector websites as being focused on them, since they listed recent transactions, accounts, and other personalized information.

Participants who were redirected to My VA after logging in felt they experienced a similar level of personalization. Although they still wished for links to personalized content on unauthenticated pages, My VA helped them get directly to their most important tasks.

> I’m glad it’s [claim status] on the first page without me having to navigate it. - P5

> I wish the My VA page was the homepage. Under healthcare [on homepage], it has refill and track prescriptions, but the My VA page also shows my next appointment.  - P7

However, participants who didn’t see My VA until the moderator prompted them at the end of the session, felt like they didn’t have the same kind of personalized experience they have elsewhere.

> VA.gov is much more cumbersome than Wells Fargo Banking…still, going to look at his benefits I think is the most, I guess the word is “cumbersome”. Complicated, cumbersome whatever. - P1’s caregiver

> Thinking about banking, I do see more personal information up front than with the VA site. You have access to personal information [on VA.gov], but you have to click a menu, then a link. With the bank once you are logged you see it immediately on your dashboard. - P15

The participants who hadn’t seen My VA during their session reacted positively once the moderator directed them to it.

> I like this My VA right here, it is better than what I was doing before. And I know if I click My Health it’ll take me back to my familiar setting [MHV], but this is much better right here, and I didn’t have to log in twice. - P9

> That [My VA] was a whole lot easier, I didn’t have to go through all that stuff and log in from site to site. - P1


## Additional Insights
### Having to authenticate across multiple sites created a confusing, depersonalized experience.
5 of 9 participants experienced frustration and/or confusion while logging in. It took an advanced screenreader user nearly 10 minutes to complete the login process. Users who logged in on MHV and then had to log in again on VA.gov were particularly frustrated. One participant didn’t use the site navigation at all during the session because they were afraid they’d have to sign in again.

> I was about ready to quit. It seems like it takes a long time, and then it also seems to me like you are duplicating steps. - P9

> I was actually afraid that if I clicked everything outside of this *mouses 4 boxes on homepage* I would get signed out.  - P6

### Modals and opening links in new tabs created usability hurdles for some users, especially those without full vision.
Multiple participants were unexpectedly presented with modals or links opening in new tabs during their session, causing them to become flustered or make mistakes.

> Ok y’all need to get rid of that stupid pop up thingy. I don’t want to go to the new homepage. - P2, after dismissing the “try the new homepage” modal multiple times

> Those [modals], for him, are really distracting, because he has the screen enlarged and if an ad pops up, the screen will moves over to the ad. The screen is constantly changing for him. - P1’s caregiver

> Can he X out of all these tabs, so he doesn’t have so many open? - P1’s caregiver

- A screenreader participant accidentally closed out of the tab where they were logged in, and had to restart the browser to start over.
- Sighted participants were caught off guard when links opened in new tabs, and and had to revisit multiple open tabs to figure out how to get back to where they wanted to be.

### People using magnification struggle with multi-column layouts.
One participant in our study used ZoomText, and needed anywhere from 4-7x magnification, depending on the page.  They repeatedly shared frustrations and challenges with multi-column layouts on VA.gov.

> Because of his vision loss, if all the choices were on one side of the screen, like on the far left hand side of the screen, and you just went there, and even search could be one of the choices. But it would just list all the choices for that site, and you either found it or clicked on the search… moving all over the screen, it’s difficult for him. - P1’s caregiver

> If all of this was in one column… you always read left to right… if I’m on the left side of the page instead of trying to go across the page, across 2-3 different [columns]… it would make it a lot easier for me. - P1

The navigation menu also presented some challenges:

> I can only see 2 [columns] on the screen at a time. And then to get this one, manage your benefits and the comparison tool, I have to move my magnifier over….and I’d have to have it a little bigger than this for it to actually be comfortable to read. - P1

### The process of requesting travel reimbursement is a pain point.
Although it wasn’t the focus of our research, challenges around requesting travel reimbursement organically came up in multiple sessions. 
- 2 participants were pleasantly surprised to come across the link on My VA, and talked about how that would make it easier to find the place to upload their travel letter.
- 1 participant and their caregiver shared frustrations with every aspect of the process, especially navigating the website using magnification tools. They stated this is the number one problem they want to talk about when they participate in research sessions, in hopes of it being fixed someday.

> You really have to be a computer wiz to upload a travel letter. He says he goes to a provider outside of the VA and he does for his back. But trying to get that letter, that he went to the appt, upload it so he can get travel benefits for it, is almost impossible. - P1’s caregiver

We’ve heard about this pain point in other research sessions too. It’s clear this is a negative experience for Veterans.

## Recommendations
### Make My VA the true logged-in homepage.
Based on what we saw in this study, the current homepage isn’t useful for people who are logged-in to VA.gov. 
- Participants felt My VA gave them direct access to their most important tasks, and recognized the redundancy of those links on the homepage. This aligns with their expectations of a modern digital experience, based on private sector websites.
- Participants who used the homepage to navigate, instead of My VA, only did so because they were unfamiliar with the site. Once they saw My VA, they preferred it to the homepage.
- The new homepage design does not elevate top tasks for logged-in users in the same way My VA or the current homepage does, which may make it significantly less useful than My VA once it launches.

We likely need to do some pre-work before this could be truly successful, such as better surfacing Records in the auth experience, and evaluating what to do with non-task content on the current homepage.

### Reconsider the logged-in navigation, including the personalized menu.
Links in the personalized menu are duplicated in the global navigation, and many links in the mega menu are repeated on My VA.  The personalized menu hasn’t been revisited in the 5 years since it’s launched, and we now have many more personalized tools on VA.gov. We should identify ways we can streamline and improve navigation options, while maintaining ease-of-access to top tasks from anywhere on the website.

### Explore how we can increase access to personalized content throughout VA.gov.
Participants had a hard time finding personalized information that wasn’t already surfaced on My VA or in the profile.  We should identify what we might be able to surface throughout the site that don’t currently have personalized information people have to hunt for.  This exploration should include:
- Identifying pages in the benefit hubs where it makes sense to surface or link to personalized content when a person is logged in.
- Identifying what we might be able to surface in profile and My VA that we aren’t already showing, like dependents and benefit letters. 
- Consider if there are ways we can display information, rather than link to it, to give Veterans more direct access to their tasks.

### Reconsider our current approach to modals, and links that open in new tabs.
Multiple participants in our study became confused and/or frustrated by these unexpected interactions on the website. We should consider if there is another approach we can take to improve accessibility and UX, while still getting people to the content they need.

### Cross-reference these findings with previous research we did to identify issues with the logged-in IA and navigation.
We conducted 3 other research activities ([research folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/information-architecture/research-and-analytics/2023-generative-logged-in-research)) to answer questions about logged-in IA and navigation. Now we need to take a holistic view across all findings, and make a plan for next steps.	
	
## Research Process Insights
### We had to sacrifice some of our recruitment criteria due to the order in which participants were recruited. 
There were 3 spots left open for multiple days leading up to the study: Perigean was looking for participants who were family members or caregivers, had a cognitive impairment, *and* used screen readers. Our criteria didn’t specify that one person had to meet all of these criteria, but due to the order which the spots were filled, this is what remained. We wonder if a more strategic recruiting approach would have mitigated this, and will discuss this for future studies during the recruitment kick-off call.

### Our screener questions for screen reader users worked well.
We’ve been iterating on screen reader recruitment questions, and for this study ([screener questions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/research-and-analytics/2023-generative-logged-in-research/2023-logged-in-user-interviews/research-plan.md#screener-questions)), all participants who showed up for their sessions used their screenreader during the session as they described during recruitment.  This has not been the case in the past.

### We can learn a lot from sessions that include participants and their caregivers.
P1 unexpectedly joined with their caregiver, and we were able to interview both people during the session. This yielded insights we wouldn’t have been able to get otherwise, and we recommend this approach for future studies when we want to better understand the experience of people who have a caregiver or work closely with someone else to navigate VA, or the internet.

## Further research needed

### Conduct research to validate any changes we make based on recommendations above.
We’ll need to conduct more research to support any changes we make as a result of the recommendations above.  

### Conduct research with non-Veterans, and people who are brand new to the site, to better understand what they need from VA.gov.
This study included some perspectives we haven’t done a lot of research with:
- A family member who is totally unfamiliar with VA.gov
- A caregiver/family member who was moderately familiar with VA.gov
- A participant in the Caregiver program who was very familiar with VA.gov
- A Veteran who was totally unfamiliar with VA.gov

Each of these participants had a unique set of needs and challenges finding their way around the site. It would be helpful to better understand how we can improve the experience for them, especially as we scale the site to add non-veteran user roles ([previous research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity/user-roles/discovery)).

### Conduct research with people who require magnification, to further evaluate usability problems introduced by multi-column layouts in navigation and on content pages.
This study included one user who needed ZoomText software and someone by their side to use VA.gov. We should conduct more research to better understand challenges people encounter as a first step to improving usability on the site.

### We should recruit for the underserved groups we didn’t get to talk to in this round for our next study.
Including these people in our next round of research will help our team get a diverse group of perspectives.

## Next Steps
- Review with product team and align on recommendations we’ll take action on.
- Share findings with OCTO stakeholders
- Complete synthesis for holistic logged-in IA research effort
