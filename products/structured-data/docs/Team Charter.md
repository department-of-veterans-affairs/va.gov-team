# How we work

### Documentation:
**Google Drive (Ad Hoc):** https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lP6czKPYp0Qk0XalnG2CLLTxlnbS-WsN 
- Documentation that should NOT be shared publicly (e.g., BIP technical resource documents)
- WIP documents (e.g., Team of Teams slides)

**Github:** https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/structured-data
- Architecture diagrams
- Pull Request/Merging Etiquette - TBD

**ZenHub:** VFT board (labels: `structured-data` + `form 530`)
- **Icebox:** Blocked until other work is completed
- **Backlog:** Ready to be worked
- **In Progress:** Work that is currently in progress
- **Validate:** Work that is completed but is pending a review or other action from someone outside the team
- **Closed:** Work that has been reviewed and completed

**Issue Etiquette**

For an issue to go into the Backlog pipeline, it must have the following:
- **Title:** Descriptive, short
- **User story:** Describes what we’re going to build or do from the end user’s perspective
- **Tasks:** Describe steps that need to be done
- **Acceptance Criteria:** What needs to happen for this story to be considered "done"
- **Nested in an Epic:**
 1. Vets-api integration with BGS
 2. Vets-api integration with Claims
 3. Vets-api integration with eFolder
 4. Vets-api integration with BPD
 
### Workflow + Cadence
Our project cadence will be determined by our release plan (rather than sprints) since we will be releasing on a frequent basis. There will be four release cycles with intermittent PRs throughout.

- **Stand-up:** Check in on people and product progress
Mon + Weds @ 2:30 PM EST for 30 min
  - Monday: draft and review the Team of Team Slides + regular updates
  - Wednesday: debrief any pertinent Team of Teams info + regular updates
- **Release Planning:** Outline work to be done this release in order to accomplish the team's goals
1st Tuesday of every release for 1 hour
- **Grooming:** Review and adjust planned stories
1 Friday of every release for 45 min

### Communication
**Slack:**
- [#vfs-pension-automation](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/vfs-pension-automation) (dsva): Should be used for day-to-day discussions about project work
- [#vfs-platform-support](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/vfs-platform-support) (dsva): For any issues or questions
- [#va-startup-pension-automation](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/va-startup-pension-automation) (adhoc): Should only be used for sensitive internal communications

**Meetings:**
- Standup on Monday and Wednesday
- Release planning each Tuesday before a new release sprint
- Grooming Friday mid-release
- Team of Teams on Tuesdays, which Sophie will attend and report back to team about during Wednesday’s standup

### Team Norms
- Show your face (Webcam) at meetings
- Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
