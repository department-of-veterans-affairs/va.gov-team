# Repo Migration scripts

## Deprecation Script
This is the script to deprecate old files that have been moved over to va.gov-team's repo. It requires a `repo-deprecation.csv` file. This will be input data for the script. This file should be provided by the IA team after files have been migrated over to va.gov-team's. The columns names need to be formatted like so.

### Example `repo-deprecation.csv`
