# Socks Proxy Setup

More detailed instructions for setting up the socks proxy (somewhat manually) are [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/internal-tools.md#configure-the-socks-proxy) but you can also set it up with the config below and the `socks.sh` script in this directory.

First, copy the external SSH config into your `~/.ssh/config` file: (ask a devops colleague for the config setting or 
get it from [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/ssh/config)).

If you only need access to Jenkins/Grafana/etc from outside the VA network, and not to specific AWS resources, 
you only need the part of the config that starts with:

```
### Access to SOCKS proxy from public internet, by way of dev jumpbox
Host socks
    { etc }
```

Make sure to comment out any `IdentitiesOnly yes` directives set at the top level or in a `Host *` directive in your config file - this seems to cause the proxy to fail on authentication.

Once this is saved, try the following commands:

```
$ ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/*gov*
$ ssh socks -D 2001 -N
```

You may have to accept keys for servers from various IP addresses after running those commands. If it doesn't throw an error, try to [confirm the proxy works](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/internal-tools.md#test-and-use-the-socks-proxy) with the instructions linked. Once you have confirmed it works, you can use the `socks.sh` script, as follows: (you may also want to create an alias)

```
$ ./socks.sh on  # turn on socks proxy
$ ./socks.sh     # check status
$ ./socks.sh off # turn off socks proxy
```

The script assumes you have stored your key using "gov" somewhere within name (`~/.ssh/*gov*`). If you put it elsewhere or name it otherwise, you can set the VA_SOCKS_KEYFILE variable before invoking it. The script also sets up a proxy for the "Wi-Fi" network by default; if you are using a different network, you can override the SOCKS_NETWORK environment variable - for example:

```
$ SOCKS_NETWORK="USB 10/100/1000 LAN" ./socks.sh on
$ SOCKS_NETWORK="USB 10/100/1000 LAN" ./socks.sh off
```

The socks script will start the socks proxy, configure the proxy settings on your computer to use a `proxy.pac` file, and start a small webserver to serve that file up. The proxy.pac file will send only a few URLs to the proxy, sending everything else directly to the internet.

Finally, you'll need to configure your browser to use the system proxy if you use this script. This has been tested on OSX 10.14
and 10.15, and works with Safari, Firefox, and Chrome.

If you don't want to use the proxy.pac route, another option is to install a proxy switcher into your browser - [details here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/internal-tools.md#chrome--firefox).
