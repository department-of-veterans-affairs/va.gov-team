### How do I download a VA letter?

Before you download your letter, we’ll ask you to review the address we have on file for you.

This address will be listed on your letter. If this address isn’t correct, you can update it. But your letter will still be valid even with the incorrect address.

**Note:** To download a letter, you’ll need the latest version of Adobe Reader. It’s free to download.
