                        <p>You can use a premium <strong>My Health<em>e</em>Vet</strong> or premium <strong>DS Logon</strong> account to sign in to Vets.gov with a verified account. Because you already verified your identity when you got your premium account, you won’t need to verify your identity again on Vets.gov.</p>
                        <h4>How to get a premium DS Logon account</h4>                      
                        <p>Follow these 2 steps to sign up for a premium <strong>DS Logon</strong> account.</p>
                        <p><strong>1. First, make sure you’re enrolled in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS).</strong> This is the database that records all the people who are eligible for military benefits.</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>If you’re a Veteran or Servicemember or qualified family caregiver, survivor, or dependent of a Veteran or Servicemember who served after 1982,</strong> you should already be enrolled in DEERS.</li>
                          <li><strong>If you’re a Veteran or the qualified family caregiver, survivor, or dependent of a Veteran who served before 1982,</strong> you may not be enrolled. To enroll, call us at <a href="tel:+1phonenumber">1-800-827-1000</a> and choose “Option 7.” Tell the operator you want to enroll in DEERS, and ask them to send you an email confirming when enrollment is complete.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>2. Then, register for your basic DS Logon account online.</strong></p>
                        <p>Go to the DS Logon self-service website and click on the <strong>More DS Logon Options</strong> button. From the choices that appear, select <strong>Need a DS Logon?</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>You’ll be asked to choose how you want to register:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>If you have a Common Access Card (CAC) with accessible card reader,</strong> select this option. It’s the easiest way to get a DS Logon account and upgrade to a premium account right away.</li>
                          <li><strong>If you have a Defense Finance and Account Service (DFAS) myPay account,</strong> you can select this option. You’ll be able to upgrade to a premium account right away.</li>
                          <li><strong>If you don’t have a CAC or DFAS myPay account,</strong> select the <strong>None of the above conditions apply</strong> option.</li>
                        </ul>
                           <p>The registration tool will walk you through the sign-up process for your account and will prompt you to upgrade to a premium account through an online proofing process. Through this process, you’ll be asked a series of questions to prove you’re you—and not someone pretending to be you—to help protect the personal information you’ll have access to with a premium account.</p>                        
                           <p><a href="https://myaccess.dmdc.osd.mil/">Go to the DS Logon self-service website</a>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you’d rather verify your identity and upgrade to a premium <strong>DS Logon</strong> account in person or by phone, read the instructions in the section above on verifying your identity.</p>
                        <h4>How to get a premium My Health<em>e</em>Vet account if you’re a VA patient</h4>

                        <p><strong>1. First, sign up for an account on the My Health<em>e</em>Vet website.</strong> You’ll need to have your Social Security number on hand. Be sure to choose <strong>VA Patient</strong> on the registration form. This will automatically upgrade your account to an advanced account, and then you can upgrade to a premium account.</p>

                        <p><strong>2. Then, upgrade to a premium account.</strong></p>
                        <p>You can do this in 1 of 2 ways.</p>

                        <p>To do this, sign in to <strong>My Health<em>e</em>Vet</strong> using your premium <strong>DS Logon</strong> or ID.me user ID and password.</p>
