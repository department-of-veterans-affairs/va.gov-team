### How do I access VA services for MST?

If you’re a Veteran who has experienced MST, you can get help through VA. You don’t need to have a service-connected disability rating, and you may be able to get MST-related care even if you don’t qualify for other VA services. You also don’t need to have reported the MST or have other proof that it happened.

**Here’s how to access VA services for MST:**

- **If you have a VA primary care provider,** talk to that professional about what you’ve been through. All our primary care providers are trained in MST and can help you figure out if you have related issues, like PTSD or depression. Your provider will offer treatment and support as needed.
- **If you don’t have a VA primary care provider,** call your nearest VA medical center and ask to speak to the MST coordinator. You should feel free to ask for a provider of a specific gender if that makes you feel more comfortable.<br>
[Find a VA medical center near you](/facilities/).
- **If you'd prefer to receive MST-related care outside of a medical setting,** get free confidential counseling, alcohol and drug assessment, and other support at one of our 300 community Vet Centers.<br>
[Find a Vet Center near you](/facilities/).
- **If you’re homeless or at risk of becoming homeless:**
  - Contact the National Call Center for Homeless Veterans at 1-877-4AID-VET (<a href="tel:+18774243838">1-877-424-3838</a>) for help 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. A trained VA counselor will offer information about VA homeless programs, health care, and other services in your area. The call is free and confidential.
  - Visit our website to learn about VA programs for Veterans who are homeless.<br>
  [Learn about our homelessness programs](https://www.va.gov/homeless/).  
  - Call or visit your local VA Community Resource and Referral Center. Even if you don’t qualify for VA health care, our staff can help you find non-VA resources you may qualify for in your community. <br>
  [Find your local Community Resource and Referral Center]( https://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/Crrc.asp).

You can also call the VA general information hotline at <a href="tel:+1-800-827-1000">1-800-827-1000</a>, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. (<abbr title="eastern time">ET</abbr>).<br>

[See our Guide to VA Mental Health Services](https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/docs/MHG_English.pdf).

### Can I get disability compensation (monthly payments) or other benefits from VA?

You can’t get compensation for the traumatic event itself. But you may be able to get disability compensation for conditions resulting from MST—like PTSD (the most common mental health condition linked to MST).<br>
[Find out if you can get disability benefits for PTSD](/disability-benefits/conditions/ptsd/#ptsd-disability-eligibility).

Or get help applying for disability compensation by:

- Reading our fact sheet on disability compensation for conditions related to MST. <br>
[Read the fact sheet](http://www.benefits.va.gov/BENEFITS/factsheets/serviceconnected/MST.pdf).
- Talking to the MST coordinator at your local VA regional benefit office. <br>
[Find an MST coordinator near you](http://www.benefits.va.gov/benefits/mstcoordinators.asp).
