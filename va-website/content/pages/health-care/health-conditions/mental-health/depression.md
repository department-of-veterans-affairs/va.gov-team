### How do I access VA services for depression?

The VA health care program covers depression health services. To access these services, first apply for VA health care. <br>
[Apply for health care](/health-care/apply/).

Once you’ve signed up:

- **If you have a VA primary care provider,** talk to them about your concerns. Your provider can help you figure out if you have depression—and can offer treatment and support as needed.
- **If you don’t have a VA primary care provider or have never been seen in a VA hospital or clinic:**
  - Call our general information hotline at <a href="tel:+1-800-827-1000">1-800-827-1000</a>, **or**
  - Contact your local VA medical center. <br>
  [Find a VA medical center near you](/facilities/).

<br>

### What if I don’t have VA health benefits?

You may still be able to get care:

- **If you’ve served in a combat zone,** get free private counseling, alcohol and drug assessment, and other support at one of our 300 community Vet Centers. <br>
[Find a Vet Center near you](/facilities/).
- **If you’re homeless or at risk of becoming homeless:**
  - Visit our website to learn about VA programs for Veterans who are homeless. <br>
  [Learn about our homelessness programs](https://www.va.gov/homeless/).
  - Contact the National Call Center for Homeless Veterans at 1-877-4AID-VET (<a href="tel:+18774243838">1-877-424-3838</a>) for help 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. A trained VA counselor will offer information about VA homeless programs, health care, and other services in your area. The call is free and confidential (private).
  - Call or visit your local VA Community  Resource and Referral Center. Even if you don’t qualify for VA health care, our staff can help you find non-VA resources you may qualify for in your community. <br>
  [Find your local Community Resource and Referral Center]( https://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/Crrc.asp).
