### What should I do now?

Take these steps to make sure you’re taking care of your health:

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">

Talk to your primary health care provider or your local VA environmental health coordinator about any health concerns related to your military service. [Find your local VA environmental health coordinator](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/coordinators.asp). 

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">

Ask your local VA environmental health coordinator about getting a free Ionizing Radiation Registry health exam. [Learn more about the Ionizing Radiation Registry health exam](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/radiation/benefits/registry-exam.asp).

</li>

<li class="process-step list-three">

Find out if you can get disability compensation (monthly payments) and other benefits if you have an illness or injury caused—or made worse—by your active-duty service. [See if you qualify for disability benefits due to contact with hazardous materials](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/).
