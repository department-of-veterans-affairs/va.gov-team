You may be at risk of:

- Illnesses and injuries caused by:
  - **[Extreme heat](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/heat-injuries/index.asp):** Health problems (like heat stroke, heat exhaustion, and sunburn) that can be caused by serving in hot desert climates
  - **[Toxic embedded fragments](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/toxic_fragments/index.asp):** Shrapnel and other metals (some containing chemicals) that stay in your body after an injury and can cause injury at the site of the fragment or in other parts of your body 
  - **[Noise](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/noise/index.asp):** Harmful sounds from guns, explosives, rockets, heavy weapons, jets and aircraft, and machinery that can cause or contribute to hearing loss and tinnitus (ringing in the ears)

These are malaria, brucellosis, campylobacter jejuni, coxiella burnetii (Q Fever), mycobacterium tuberculosis, nontyphoid salmonella, shigella, visceral leishmaniasis, and West Nile Virus.

So far, research shows that there’s no evidence to link PB to multi-symptom illnesses in Gulf War Veterans, but we continue to monitor these Veterans’ health issues.

### What should I do now?

Take these steps to make sure you’re taking care of your health:

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">

Talk to your primary health care provider or your local VA environmental health coordinator about any health concerns related to your military service. [Find your local VA environmental health coordinator](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/coordinators.asp). 

- **If you have embedded fragments,** ask about getting an exam through the Toxic Embedded Fragment Surveillance Center. [Download our Toxic Embedded Fragments fact sheet](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/docs/exposures/TEFSC-veterans-fact-sheet.pdf).  

- **If you think you had contact with depleted uranium,** ask about getting screened through the Depleted Uranium Follow-up Program. [Learn more about the Depleted Uranium Follow-up Program](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/depleted_uranium/followup_program.asp).

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">

Ask about getting a free exam and joining these registries to document your exposures and health concerns:
<br />
[The Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry](https://veteran.mobilehealth.va.gov/AHBurnPitRegistry/) 
<br />
[The Gulf War Registry](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/gulfwar/benefits/registry-exam.asp)
<br />
[The Ionizing Radiation Registry](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/radiation/benefits/registry-exam.asp)

</li>
