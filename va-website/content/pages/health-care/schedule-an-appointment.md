<h4 itemprop="name">How to schedule online</h4>

<div itemprop="itemListElement">

VA now offers online scheduling for some appointments and facilities. We hope to expand the number of VA facilities and types of appointments in the future.

If you have VA health care benefits, you can schedule a VA primary care appointment online if you meet all of the requirements listed below.

**Both of these must be true:**

- You're scheduling your appointment with a VA medical facility that accepts online scheduling.<br>
[Find out if your VA medical center accepts online scheduling](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/keeping-up-with-all-your-va-appointments#facility-list), **and**
- You've had an appointment at that VA medical facility within the last 2 years

**And, you must have one of these free accounts:**
- A premium My Health<em>e</em>Vet account <br>
[Sign up for a My Health*e*Vet account](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/upgrading-your-my-healthevet-account-through-in-person-or-online-authentication). <br>
