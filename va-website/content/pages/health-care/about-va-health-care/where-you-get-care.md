### Where do I go for care?

You’ll receive regular care at one VA location of your choice. If you need specialized medical treatments and services, we may refer you to other locations as well. Your health care team will use our electronic medical record system to coordinate your care no matter where you are.

**Care settings may include:**

- **VA medical centers.** These centers offer a range of services:
  - All centers provide traditional hospital-based services—like surgery, critical care, mental health, and physical therapy.
  - Most centers provide medical and surgical specialty services—like oncology (cancer care), geriatrics (elder care), and neurology (care for conditions of the brain and nervous system).
  - Some medical centers also offer advanced services—like organ transplants and plastic surgery (reconstructing or repairing parts of the body in the treatment of traumatic injury). <br>
[Find a medical center near you](/facilities/).
- **VA community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs).** These clinics provide the most common outpatient services (like health and wellness visits) so you can take care of routine appointments in a more convenient location. We keep expanding our network of CBOCs to more rural locations so we can help you access care closer to home. <br>
[Find a clinic near you](/facilities/).
- **Vet Centers.** These centers provide community-based counseling, outreach, and referral services to Veterans who served in a combat zone as well as to their families. Mobile Vet Centers also help bring care to more rural locations. <br>
[Learn more about Vet Centers](http://www.vetcenter.va.gov). <br>
[Find a Vet Center near you](/facilities/).
- **VA Community Living Centers and other assisted living or residential (live-in) settings.** These places provide support for Veterans who need more intense nursing care and help with everyday tasks (like bathing, dressing, or taking medicines). <br>
[Learn more about assisted living and residential care](/health-care/about-va-health-care/assisted-living-and-home-health-care/).
- **Your own home.** If needed, you may get medical treatment, nursing care, or help with everyday tasks in the comfort of your own home. <br>
[Learn more about home health care](/health-care/about-va-health-care/assisted-living-and-home-health-care/).

<br>

#### What if the nearest VA location can’t provide the services I need?

We may refer you to a community provider. Your eligibility for community care will be based on your specific needs and circumstances. Your VA provider will work with you to determine if you're eligible. <br>

#### Where do I get care if I live in a rural area, far from a VA medical center?

**You may be able to get care:**
- [At a VA outpatient clinic](/facilities/)
- [At a Mobile Vet Center](https://www.vetcenter.va.gov/)
- In your own home: <br>
[Learn about skilled home health care providers](https://www.va.gov/GERIATRICS/Guide/LongTermCare/Skilled_Home_Health_Care.asp). <br>
[Find out about remote telehealth services](https://www.telehealth.va.gov/).

If we can't provide the care you need, we may refer you to a community provider. Your eligibility for community care will be based on your specific needs and circumstances. 

**We may refer you to a community provider if any one of these is true for you:**
- We can’t provide the services you need, **or**
- We can’t make an appointment for you at the nearest VA medical facility within 30 days of the clinically indicated date (the date you and your VA provider agree should be the next date you’re seen for care)—or, if we can’t determine this date—the date you’d prefer to be seen next, **or**
- You live more than 40 miles (driving distance) from the nearest VA medical facility, **or**
- You have to travel by air, boat, or ferry to get to the nearest VA medical facility, **or**
- You face an excessive burden in traveling to your nearest VA medical facility (like geographic challenges, environmental factors, or a health problem that makes it hard for you to travel)

Your VA provider will work with you to determine if you're eligible. <br>

<span id="care-emergency">

#### Where should I go for care in an emergency?

Call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room. You don’t have to contact us in advance. (**Note:** We consider an emergency to be a condition that a reasonable person believes will put your health or life at risk if you don’t get treatment right away.)

If you’re far from a VA medical center, we may pay for emergency care in a non-VA setting. Be sure to contact your nearest VA medical center as soon as possible—and ask to talk to the patient transfer or patient administration representative. Payment for emergency care in a non-VA setting ends when a VA provider concludes that you’re stable enough to be transferred to a VA medical center.

For more information, call your local VA medical center’s enrollment coordinator. <br>
Or [get more details on emergency care coverage](https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/access/emergency_care.asp).
