<div itemprop="description" class="va-introtext">

Federal jobs, including those at VA, offer outstanding opportunities to Veterans and their spouses. Skills learned in the military are easily transferrable to many positions, and by working for a federal agency, you can continue to serve your country. In addition, your military service counts toward a civilian pension.

</div>

The federal job-application process is very detailed compared with most civilian organizations. Federal positions are listed, with very few exceptions, on [USAJobs](http://www.usajobs.gov).

One-on-one assistance in applying for federal jobs is available at local [Employment Centers](https://www.doleta.gov/usworkforce/onestop/onestopmap.cfm). You can also go to [Feds Hire Vets](http://www.fedshirevets.gov) for tips on applying for federal positions.
