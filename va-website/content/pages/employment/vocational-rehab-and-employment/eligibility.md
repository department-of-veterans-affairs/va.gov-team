<div class="va-introtext">

If you have a disability that was caused—or made worse—by your active-duty service and that limits your ability to work or prevents you from working, you may be eligible for Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) benefits and services. Find out if you can get employment support or help living as independently as possible.

### If I'm a Veteran, can I get VR&amp;E benefits and services?

You may be eligible for VR&E benefits and services if you’re a Veteran, and you meet all of the requirements listed below.

**All of these must be true. You:**

- Didn't receive a dishonorable discharge, **and**
- Have a service-connected disability rating of at least 10% from VA, **and**
- [Apply for VR&E services](/employment/vocational-rehab-and-employment/apply-vre/)

<br>

#### Basic period of eligibility

**Your basic period of eligibility ends 12 years from the date you received notice of your:**
- Date of separation from active military service, **or**
- First VA service-connected disability rating

**Please note:** The basic period of eligibility may be extended if a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) finds that you have a Serious Employment Handicap (SEH). Having an employment handicap means your service-connected disability limits your ability to prepare for, obtain, and maintain suitable employment (a job that doesn’t make your disability worse, is stable, and matches your abilities, aptitudes, and interests).

<br>

### If I'm still on active duty, can I get VR&amp;E benefits and services?

You may be eligible for VR&amp;E benefits and services if you're a Servicemember and you meet at least one of the requirements listed below.

**At least one of these must be true. You:**

- Have a 20% or higher pre-discharge disability rating (memorandum rating) and will soon leave the military, **or**
- Are participating in the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) process or awaiting discharge due to a medical condition resulting from a serious injury or illness that occurred in the line of duty. <br>
[Learn more about accessing VR&E services through IDES](/employment/vocational-rehab-and-employment/ides/).

**Please note:** Severely injured active-duty Servicemembers can automatically receive VR&E benefits before VA issues a disability rating, because of Sec. 1631(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act (PL 110-181). The sunset date of that law has been extended to September 30, 2018, through Sec. 724 of Public Law 113-291.

<br>

### What should I do if I received an other than honorable, bad conduct, or dishonorable discharge?

If you've received one of these discharge statuses, you may not be eligible for VA benefits.

**There are 2 ways you can try to qualify:**
