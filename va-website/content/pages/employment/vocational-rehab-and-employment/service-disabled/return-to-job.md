<div class="va-introtext">

As a Veteran, you’re protected under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). This means you can’t be disadvantaged in your civilian career because of your service.

If you’re a Veteran with a service-connected disability, the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) Reemployment track can help your employer accommodate your needs. Your Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) can provide a full range of rehabilitation services, and can refer you directly to the Department of Labor to begin the process. Find out how we can help you return to your former job and support your employer in meeting your needs.

</div>

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

### Can I get help returning to my former job through VR&amp;E?

You may be eligible for help if you're a Veteran with a service-connected disability, and you meet all of the requirements listed below.

**All of these must be true. You:**

- Have an employment barrier or handicap, **and**
- Are enrolled in Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E), **and**
- Would like to return to your former job

**Note:** Having an employment handicap means your service-connected disability limits your ability to  prepare for, obtain, and maintain suitable employment (a job that doesn’t make your disability worse, is stable, and matches your abilities, aptitudes, and interests).

</div>

Help with the process of returning to the job you held before you deployed.
