<div class="va-introtext">

If you’re a Veteran, and either you or your spouse is Native American, our Native American Direct Loan (NADL) program may help you get a loan to buy, build, or improve a home on Federal Trust Land. You may also get a loan to refinance an existing NADL and reduce your interest rate. Find out if you qualify for a NADL—and how to apply.

### Can I get a NADL?

You may be able to get a NADL if you’re a Native American Veteran or a non–Native American Veteran married to a Native American, and you meet all of the requirements listed below.

**All of these must be true:**
- Your tribal government has an agreement—or Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)—with us detailing how the program will work on its Trust lands, **and**
-	You have a valid VA home loan Certificate of Eligibility (COE), **and**
-	You meet our credit standards, **and**
-	You have proof that you make enough money to cover the mortgage payments and other costs of owning a home, **and**
-	You’ll live in the home you’re using the NADL to buy, build, or improve

### Why might I want to get a NADL?

**A NADL offers many benefits, including:**

- **No down payment** required in most cases
- **No need for Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)**, which is commonly charged to conventional loan borrowers 
- **Limited closing costs** (fees you pay for services and other costs related to getting a loan and buying a home)
- **A low-interest, 30-year fixed mortgage** (a fixed mortgage means your interest rate will stay the same over the full life of the loan)
- **A reusable benefit**, which means you can get more than one NADL to buy, build, or improve another residence in the future
- **The ability to borrow up to the FannieMae/FreddieMac conforming loan limit** on a no-down-payment loan in most areas—and more in some high-cost counties. You can borrow more than this amount if you want to make a down payment. <br>
