### Can I get disability benefits from VA?

You may be able to get disability benefits if you didn't receive a dishonorable discharge and have an illness that’s on the list of those believed to be caused by radiation—or that doctors say may be caused by radiation. <br>
[See the list of radiation-related illnesses](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&node=38:1.0.1.1.4#se38.1.3_1309). 

You must also have had contact with ionizing radiation while serving in the military in at least one of the below ways.

**One of these must describe your contact with ionizing radiation while serving in the military. You:**

- Were part of atmospheric nuclear weapons testing, **or**
- Served in the postwar occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, **or**
- Were a prisoner of war (POW) in Japan, **or**
- Worked as an x-ray technician, in a reactor plant, or in nuclear medicine or radiography (while on active duty or during active or inactive duty for training in the Reserves), **or**
- Did tasks like those of a Department of Energy (DOE) employee that make them a member of the Special Exposure Cohort (See 42 U.S.C. 7384L(14))

<br>

**You may also qualify for disability benefits if you served in at least one of the below locations and capacities. You were:**
- Part of underground nuclear weapons testing at Amchitka Island, Alaska, **or**
- Assigned to a gaseous diffusion plant at Paducah, Kentucky, **or**
- Assigned to a gaseous diffusion plant at Portsmouth, Ohio, **or**
- Assigned to a gaseous diffusion plant at Area K-25 at Oak Ridge, Tennessee

- Compensation (payments)

------

### How do I get these benefits?

You’ll need to apply for benefits. <br>
[Apply for benefits](/disability-benefits/apply/).

Your service records must show that you were part of 1 of the radiation risk activities described above. You’ll also need to claim an illness or disability believed to be caused by contact with radiation. It’s not enough to state that you had contact with radiation during service.

When you apply, we’ll ask the military branch that you served with (or the Defense Threat Reduction Agency) to give us a range of how much radiation they think you may have come into contact with. We’ll use the highest level of the range they report to decide on your benefits.
