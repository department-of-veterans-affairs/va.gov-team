<div class="va-introtext">

You may be able to get disability benefits if you have signs of an illness like hypertension (high blood pressure), arthritis, diabetes, or peptic ulcers that started within a year after you were discharged from active military service.


If your symptoms appear within 1 year after discharge—even if they weren’t there while you were serving—we’ll conclude that they’re related to your service. <br>

### How do I get these benefits?

You’ll need to apply for benefits. When you apply, you’ll have to show that your illness is at least 10% disabling. (For example, you may include a doctor’s report showing that you’re taking medicine for your high blood pressure.) You’ll also need to show that the illness appeared within 1 year after being discharged from active service. <br>
