You can use the GI Bill for independent and distance learning online. If you’re using your Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits while taking only distance-learning courses, we’ll pay a housing allowance based on 50% of the national average. [View current payment rates](https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp).
