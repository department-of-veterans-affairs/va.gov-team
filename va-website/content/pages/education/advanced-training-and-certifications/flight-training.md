The benefits depend on the benefit program you use:

**If you use the Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty (MGIB-AD) or the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP)**, we’ll pay you back for 60% of the approved fees.<br />
[Learn about MGIB-AD](/education/gi-bill/montgomery-active-duty/).<br />
[Learn about REAP](/education/other-educational-assistance-programs/reap/).<br />
[View the current payment rates for MGIB-AD and REAP](https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp). 

**If you use the Post-9/11 GI Bill**, your payment depends on the program and the type of school you’re going to: 
- If your school is a stand-alone Part 141 pilot school, we’ll pay the school for the net cost of training up to a yearly limit.\* 
- If you’re enrolled in a degree program that consists of flight training at a public college or university, we’ll pay back the school for the net cost of tuition and fees.\*
- If you’re enrolled in a degree program that consists of flight training at a private college or university, we’ll pay back the school for the net cost of tuition and fees up to a yearly limit.\* 

[View the current payment rates for the Post-9/11 GI Bill](https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp).

\*Your level of eligibility and/or your remaining entitlement limits the payment amount.
