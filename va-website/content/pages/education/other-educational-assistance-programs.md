If you’re a Guardsman, Reservist, or Veteran who doesn’t qualify for the Post-9/11 GI Bill, you can apply for education benefits through these other programs:

</div>

- [The post-Vietnam Era Veterans’ Educational Assistance Program](/education/other-educational-assistance-programs/veap/) (VEAP, Chapter 32)
- [The Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty](/education/gi-bill/montgomery-active-duty/) (MGIB-AD, Chapter 30)
- [The Montgomery GI Bill Selected Reserve](/education/gi-bill/montgomery-selected-reserve/) (MGIB-SR, Chapter 1606)
- [The National Call to Service program](/education/other-educational-assistance-programs/call-to-service/)

An accredited representative (a trained professional trusted to help with VA-related claims) who works with a Veterans Service Organization (VSO) can help you pick the right program. [Get help from an accredited representative](/disability-benefits/apply/help/index.html).

The GI Bill Comparison Tool shows you what benefits you’ll get at different schools. [Use the GI Bill Comparison Tool](/gi-bill-comparison-tool).

**Note:** The Post-9/11 GI Bill has replaced the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) for Reserve and National Guard members called to active duty on or after September 11, 2001. But if you applied for REAP on or after November 25, 2015, you may still qualify for benefits. [Learn more about REAP](/education/other-educational-assistance-programs/reap/).
