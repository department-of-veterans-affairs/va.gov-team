You can use VA education benefits at some—but not all—schools. Before you apply:

- Find schools that take part in the Yellow Ribbon Program, which can help you pay for school costs not covered by the Post-9/11 GI Bill. [Learn more about the Yellow Ribbon Program](/education/gi-bill/yellow-ribbon/).
