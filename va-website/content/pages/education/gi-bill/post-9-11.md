If you need help paying for school or job training and you’ve served on active duty after September 10, 2001, you may qualify for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Find out if you can get education benefits through the Post-9/11 GI Bill.

<h3 itemprop="name">Can I get education benefits?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

You can get education benefits if you meet both of the requirements listed below.

**Both of these must be true:**
- You qualify for any GI Bill program, **and** 
- You’ve served on active duty for at least 90 days—with or without a break in service—after September 10, 2001.

If you qualify for more than one VA education benefit, you’ll have to pick which one you want to use. This is an irrevocable decision, meaning you can’t change your mind.

<h3 itemprop="name">Does this benefit expire?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits expire 15 years after your last separation date from active service. You must use all of your benefit by that time or you’ll lose whatever’s left.

**If your service ended on or after January 1, 2013:** There’s no time limit (known as a “delimiting date”) to use your education benefits. A recently enacted law gets rid of the expiration date for you. This change may not be reflected in some of the letters you receive from us. We're working to update our systems to support this change. We appreciate your patience as we make the updates to our systems.

You’ll need to apply. <br>
[Apply for education benefits](/education/apply-for-education-benefits/). 

The benefit amount depends on which school you go to, how much active-duty service you’ve had since September 10, 2001, and how many credits or training hours you’re taking.

<h3 itemprop="name">What benefits does the Post-9/11 GI Bill include?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

- The full tuition amount for in-state schools up to the maximum national average of $22,805.34
- A Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) based on the cost of living where your school is located
- Up to 36 months of education benefits, in most cases payable for 15 years after your release from active duty

**Example:** If you had 90 days of active service since September 10, 2001, you would qualify for 40% of the maximum amount. Three years of active service would qualify you for 100% of the benefit.
