<h3 itemprop="name">Can I get this benefit?</h3>
<div itemprop="itemListElement">

You can get this benefit if you meet both of the requirements listed below.

**Both of these must be true:**
- You qualify for the maximum benefit rate under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, **and**
- Your school takes part in the Yellow Ribbon Program and has confirmed your enrollment with us

You may be able to get this benefit if you’re the dependent of a Veteran who qualifies for transfer of entitlement for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. <br />

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">

##### Apply for benefits

[Apply for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits](/education/apply-for-education-benefits/). <br>
If you qualify for benefits, you’ll get a Certificate of Eligibility (COE).

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">

##### Turn in your COE

Bring your COE to your school’s certifying official, or to the financial aid, military liaison, or other office as determined by your school, and ask to apply to your school’s Yellow Ribbon Program.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-three">

##### Wait for a decision

###### Your school will decide:
-  Whether it has already enrolled the maximum number of students for the program period. Enrollment is on a first-come, first-served basis. We have an agreement with each school about on how many students may be covered each year.
-  How much the entitlement will be. Your school decides this amount by adding up tuition and mandatory fees, and then subtracting any specific aid you’ve gotten from other sources—such as scholarships or grants, as well as your Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition payment. Your school applies the Yellow Ribbon Program benefit to this final amount.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-four">

##### Follow up

You’ll get a notice from your school about whether it has accepted you into the program and how much money you’ll get for tuition.
