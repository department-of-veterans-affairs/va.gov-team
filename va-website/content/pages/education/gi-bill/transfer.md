**Note:** The Department of Defense (DoD) decides whether you can transfer benefits to your family.

<h3 itemprop="name">Can I transfer benefits?</h3>

<div itemprop="text">

You can transfer benefits if you’re on active duty or in the Selected Reserve and you meet the requirements listed below.

**At least one of these must be true:**
 - You have completed at least 6 years of service on the date your request is approved and you agree to add 4 more years of service, **or**
 - You have completed at least 10 years of service on the date your request is approved, can’t commit to add 4 more years of service because of either a policy or statute, but agree to serve for the maximum amount of time allowed

**And this must also be true:**

The person getting benefits has enrolled in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS).

<h3 itemprop="name">What benefits can my qualified dependents get?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

If the DoD approves the Transfer of Entitlement (TOE), your spouse or dependent children can apply for up to 36 months of benefits, and may be able to get money for:

- Tuition
- Housing
- Books and supplies

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">

<h3 itemprop="name">When can they use the transferred benefits?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

These conditions apply to family members using transferred benefits:

#### Spouses
- May use the benefit right away
- May use the benefit while you’re on active duty or after you’ve separated from service
- Don’t qualify for the monthly housing allowance while you’re on active duty
- May use the benefit for up to 15 years after your separation from active duty

#### Children
- May start to use the benefit only after you’ve finished at least 10 years of service
- May use the benefit while you’re on active duty or after you’ve separated from service
- May not use the benefit until they’ve gotten a high school diploma (or equivalency certificate), or have reached 18 years of age
- Qualify for the monthly housing allowance even when you’re on active duty
- Don’t have to use the benefit within 15 years after your separation from active duty, but can’t use the benefit after they’ve turned 26 years old.


Your dependents may still qualify even if a child marries or you and your spouse divorce. However, Servicemembers and Veterans can revoke (cancel) or change a TOE at any time. If you want to totally revoke transferred benefits for a dependent and you’re still in the service, please turn in another transfer request for the dependent through milConnect. If a dependent’s transfer eligibility (ability to get a TOE) has been totally revoked, you can’t transfer benefits again to that dependent.

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">

<h3 itemprop="name">How do I transfer the benefit?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

While you’re still on active duty, you’ll request to transfer, change, or revoke a Transfer of Entitlement (TOE) through milConnect. You can’t apply for a TOE through us. <br>
[Transfer, change, or revoke a TOE](https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/milconnect/).

If the DoD approves the TOE, your family members may apply for benefits.

- [Apply online now](/education/apply-for-education-benefits/application/1990e/introduction), **or**
- Apply by mail. Fill out and mail an Application for Family Member to Use Transferred Benefits (VA Form 22-1990E) to the nearest VA regional office. <br>
[Download VA Form 22-1990E](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-22-1990e-ARE.pdf).

[Find a nearby VA facility](/facilities/).

Once you leave active duty, you can still provide a future effective date for when the TOE can be used, change the number of months transferred, or revoke the TOE by submitting a written request to VA through milConnect.
