If you’re the legally recognized spouse or a designated (legally chosen) family member of a Veteran who died, we may pay you a set amount for burial and funeral costs. This is called an allowance. We may also help with transportation costs. Find out how to get allowances.

### Can I get burial allowances?

You may be able to get burial allowances if you're paying for the burial and funeral costs, and if any of the below relationships or professional roles describes your connection to the deceased.

**One of these must describe your relationship or role. You’re:**

- A surviving child of the Veteran, **or**
- A parent of the Veteran, **or**
- The executor or administrator (someone who officially represents the deceased) of the Veteran’s estate

<br>

To get this benefit, the Veteran must not have received a dishonorable discharge, and one of the below circumstances must be true.

**One of these must be true of the deceased Veteran. They:**

- Died as a result of a service-connected disability (a disability related to service), **or**
