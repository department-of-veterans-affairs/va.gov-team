# Overview
As part of the VA Web Brand Consolidation effort, 

Details of the SSO implementation can be found here: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/SSO/%5B%2311505%5D%20VA.gov%20MHV%20SSO%20Matrix.md

# Approach
Each health tool will have a content landing page, such as below for Refill Prescriptions:
![Refill Prescriptions Example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/identity/images/VA.gov%20Health%20Tool%20Content%20Page.png)

This page will be displayed to the user in the following scenarios:
- The user clicks on a link to the health tool and is not logged in
- The user clicks on a link to the health tool, is logged in, but needs to upgrade their account access
- The user clicks on a link to the health tool, is logged in, but cannot upgrade their account access
- The user has attempted to upgrade their account access; the upgrade failed, and the user is blocked from accessing the tool
- The user has attempted to upgrade their account access; the upgrade failed, but the user may still be directed to the tool
- The user has otherwise navigated to this page, and may be logged in with access to the tool
