# Overview
As part of the VA Web Brand Consolidation effort, SSO is being implemented such that users who have logged in to VA.gov will be able to seamlessly transition into My HealtheVet when attempting to access health tools. While there is a happy path for such users when they are already logged in with an account that has sufficient access rights (e.g. MHV Premium), there are several other cases that need to be handled gracefully.

Details of the MHV SSO implementation can be found here: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/SSO/%5B%2311505%5D%20VA.gov%20MHV%20SSO%20Matrix.md

# Approach
Each health tool will have a content landing page, such as below for Refill Prescriptions:
![Refill Prescriptions Example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/identity/images/VA.gov%20Health%20Tool%20Content%20Page.png)

Specifically, the "You need to sign in..." blue box near the center can be used to handle the different states of how a user could land on this page.  In summary, the following scenarios can be encountered:
- The user clicks on a link to the health tool and is not logged in
- The user clicks on a link to the health tool, is logged in, but needs to upgrade their account access
- The user clicks on a link to the health tool, is logged in, but cannot upgrade their account access
- The user has attempted to upgrade their account access; the upgrade failed, and the user is blocked from accessing the tool
- The user has attempted to upgrade their account access; the upgrade failed, but the user may still be directed to the tool
- The user has otherwise navigated to this page, and may be logged in with access to the tool

The contents of the blue box will need to reflect the given state (and may be a different color depending on the state).

Overall however, if a user clicks on a link for a tool and does have the proper access rights for the tool, they should be taken directly to the tool.

## Not Logged In
If a user visits a health tool content landing page when they are not logged in, they should see messaging that states they need to log in with their credential in order to access the tool.

After logging in, the content landing page should display a state that explains a new tab has been opened (with a link/button to re-open the link), and the tool should open in MHV on a new tab.

## Upgrade Required
If a user visits a health tool content landing page when they are logged in, but their account needs to be upgraded to Premium, they should see messaging that states they need to verify their identity to upgrade their account and access the tool.

After successfully completing identity proofing and account upgrade, the content landing page should display a state that explains a new tab has been opened (with a link/button to re-open the link), and the tool should open in MHV on a new tab.

If the upgrade fails, then an error state should be shown.

## Upgrade Not Possible
If a user visits a health tool content landing page when they are logged in, but their account has no path to be upgraded to Premium (i.e. they have a MHV Basic account), they should see messaging that states they cannot access the tool because of their account type.

## Upgrade Failed
If the user attempted to upgrade their account type but the upgrade failed, then an error state should be shown.

There is an alternate case where we attempt to upgrade the user's account type, but the upgrade is not actually necessary; in this case, the error message should be shown, but the user should be given a link that will allow them to still navigate to the tool.

## Direct Navigation with Proper Rights
If the user has directly navigated to the health tool content landing page when they are logged in with an account that has proper access rights, the should see messaging that allows them to navigate directly to the tool.
