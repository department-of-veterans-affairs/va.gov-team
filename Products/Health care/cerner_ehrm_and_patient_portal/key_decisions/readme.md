# Key Decisions from Workshops 

## Workshop 7

### Rx Refill
#### Decision: Do not turn on Rx Refill until Cerner has a technical solution akin to VA's current prescription refill.

In Cernerland yesterday, Cerner revealed that they will definitely NOT have Rx Refill in place for IOC. They proposed a solution that would have Veterans send a secure message to the pharmacy team for refills; however, when we explored the end-to-end experience, this approach introduced a number of risks that neither the patient experience nor the pharmacy councils were willing to accept. 

1. The Cerner portal lists all of the prescriptions for a Veteran (from Cerner, VistA, as well as anything a Veteran self-reports taking; i.e. an OTC drug such as melatonin or sudafed.) Cerner's solution had no way to prevent a Veteran from submitting a refill for either an OTC medicine or a medicine from VistA. However, pharmacists have no way to refill a VistA medication because the pharmacists will not be  able to see those parts of the patient records to verify if the medication can be refilled. Of course, there's no way for pharmacists to refill OTC medications. This introduces a new workflow where pharmacists have to 1) look in the record to see if the prescription is there or eligible for refill; if not 2) either send a message back or call a Veteran to inform them that they have to use MHV, Audiocare, or call their doctor. 
2. There is no way to provide feedback to a Veteran after they have sent the message to the pharmacy. While Veterans now have a way to get status updates, a secure message will go into the abyss. This will likely introduce a lot of uncertainty, which will drive up anxiety and confusion, and in turn, calls to the Call Center. 
3. The proposed Cerner workflow introduces a manual process where there has been previously an automated one: a) go into message center to check for new refill messages; b) check on the prescription in the record; c) if it doesn't exist, follow the path named above; if it does exist, copy and paste the content of the message into a new flow that adds the Rx to the refill queue. This will add significant time to the refill process, which will either slow refills or will necessitate hiring many new pharmacy techs. Spokane alone has 16K refills a year. 

Cerner has promised the refill functionality for IOC2 in October. The most compassionate thing to do for patients would be to push IOC out til October when several key functions will be released throughout the system that will make a transformational difference for patient and provider experience. Barring that, the decision from the 2 councils is to direct Veterans to use Audiocare or call their pharmacy for refills at Spokane (and other locations) until the technical capabilities exist. Audiocare can take refills and file them into the refill queue in the meanwhile. Cerner said they are taking this into advisement and will share our decision with OEHRM, which will make the final decision.
