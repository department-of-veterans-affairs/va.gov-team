# Solution Narrative 

## Key Decisions

### Search and TeamSite prioritization
- Search MVP is in scope for Nov 7 launch (MVP = functioning search feature, replicating Vets.gov functionality, but w/new VA branding). Search V2 is not in scope, because it was determined that the TeamSite header/footer integration is higher priority.
- Thus, Dragons will take on the TeamSite header/footer project, deprioritizing Search V2.
