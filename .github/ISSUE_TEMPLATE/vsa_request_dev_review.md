- [ ] **Spot check review** (Review and follow the steps in the [508 Checklist](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/508-checklist.md) first.) This happens well before launch, so that the 508 office can review and any issues addressed *before* launch.
