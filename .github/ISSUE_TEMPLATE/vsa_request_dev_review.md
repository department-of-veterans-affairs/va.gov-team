- [ ] **Design collaboration review** (Review design to discuss accessibility and inclusive design) - This may happen as design evolves.

- [ ] **Development intent review** (Review design to discuss approach to take with development, identify what components and semantic HTML would be appropriate, identify any accessibility issues and how to address) - This would happen as designs are passed to development, before development begins.

- [ ] **Spot check review** (Review and follow the steps in the [508 Checklist](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/508-checklist.md) first.)
