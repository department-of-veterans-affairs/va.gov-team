## Summary
The purpose of this template is to capture requirements for onboarding a software application to the Platform's delivery infrastructure. 

### Overview
- The Platform leverages container orchestration to host and deploy software applications  
- Container orchestration automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications
- To learn more, see ["Application Hosting and Deployment using Container Orchestration (EKS)"](https://vfs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OT/pages/1474593866/Application+Hosting+and+Deployment+using+Container+Orchestration+EKS)

_Requesting team; Infrastructure Team can assist_  
- [ ] **Dockerfile:** _provide link to Dockerfile here_ | [Example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/platform-console-api/blob/master/Dockerfile) | [Docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)  
_Requesting team; Infrastructure Team can assist_  

### Application delivery pipeline (CI/CD)
- [ ] **AWS service account for GitHub actions**, ie `svc-gha-team-name` | [Request here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=operations%2C+devops%2C+needs-grooming&template=ops_issue_template.md&title=)  
_Infrastructure Team_
- [ ] **AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository for the app container:** _provide name of ECR repo here_
