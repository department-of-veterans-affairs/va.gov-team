# VFS Custom Event Audit Form

### What this form is for.
In prepration for the migration to GA4, we need information on _all_ custom events used by your products so we can continue to track them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please complete this form with the related spreadsheet included as soon as possible, but no later than **Friday, April 5.** The final deadline where Universal Analytics will stop collecting data is **June 30, 2024**, so we are trying to ensure tracking coverage _well_ before that date.

Please reach out to the **#_vfs-analytics_** Slack channel if there are any questions.
