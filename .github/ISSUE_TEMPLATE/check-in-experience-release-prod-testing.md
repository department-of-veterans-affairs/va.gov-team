## Why test in prod?
From time to time we encounter new features that work differently in prod than they do on stage. One example of this is when we need to talk to other systems and have not previously connected to the prod version of the system. It is also important for new big features to be tested in prod so we can see how things look with real data.

## How to test in prod
Right now we have two options.

### Option #1: 
Ask for help from Robert Tow. Robert is a veteran that works for the VA who can get test appointments secheduled in off hours at a St. Louis clinic. He also does have real appointments, so that needs to be considered based on what kinds of features we are testing. Robert can be contacted at Robert.Tow@va.gov or via MS teams. The appointments he has used in the past are at station 657, division 657GB, and clinic ien 19125.

### Option #2
Ask for help from Shawn Adams. Shawn has his cell phone number associated with multiple accounts across a few stations. These are test users at test clinics in the prod vista enviroment. Shawn can't create the appointments himself and needs to request them to be made. Shawn is easy to reach via slack.
