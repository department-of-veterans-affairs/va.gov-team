## Background 
Va.gov profile is deploying support for international phone numbers. Forms teams will need to review the list below to ensure their form(s) supports international phone numbers. At some point in the near future, lack of support for international phone numbers will be launch blocking.

Communication around these changes can be found in the slack channel: [#international-phone-numbers ](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C08P5UMPBKN)

Do not close this ticket until you've resolved the items below: 
- [ ] The corresponding paper form supports international phone numbers 
- [ ] The digital form supports international phone numbers 
- [ ] Does the API (or API's if your form has multiple backup paths) support the use of international phone numbers 
- [ ] If your form uses prefill that isn't the official prefill, you are at risk for a breaking change around Aug 13th
