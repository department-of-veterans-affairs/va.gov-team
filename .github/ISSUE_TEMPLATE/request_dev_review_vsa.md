## Product Description


## Checkpoint Stage

[ ] **Design-Development Intent Checkpoint** (Review design to discuss approach to take with development, identify what components and semantic HTML would be appropriate, identify any accessibility issues and how to address) - This would happen as designs are passed to development, before development begins.

[ ] **Spot Check Review Checkpoint** (Review and follow the steps in the [508 Checklist](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/508-checklist.md) first.) This happens well before launch, so that the 508 office can review and any issues addressed *before* launch.

[ ] **Pre-Launch 508 Review** Once your code is stable in Staging (Review [Pre-Launch 508 Review platform-level documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/edit/master/platform/accessibility/508-request-prelaunch-review.md)) **All applications and features on the Veteran-facing Services Platform are required to be accessible and 508 compliant.** This includes adherence to the updated [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) standards and the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) Level A and AA success criteria.
