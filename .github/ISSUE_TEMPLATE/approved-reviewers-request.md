# PR Approver Preparation Checklist

Certain federal engineers can get approval to review their team's code and bypass a Platform PR review. Use this checklist to ensure you are prepared to become a PR approver for your team's code.

**Engineer Name:**

**Team Name & [GitHub Team](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/teams):**
<!-- Name of your team and code-owning GitHub team(s) -->

## Training

- [ ] Thoroughly review the [Code review guide for vets-api](https://vfs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BCP/pages/3155394563/Code+review+guide+for+vets-api).
- [ ] Review and save this [PR tips page](https://vfs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BCP/pages/3918135327/PR+tips+for+federal+engineers) for details once you start reviewing and merging PRs.
- [ ] Review the [PR best practices](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/submitting-pull-requests-for-approval) for the Platform.
- [ ] I understand that by approving changes, I am responsible for leading efforts to address any issues that may arise. This includes facilitating blameless postmortems and driving the implementation of necessary remediations and improvements.

## Tools and Access

- [ ] I have access to the necessary repositories.
- [ ] I have the required permissions to approve and merge PRs within the repository my team works in.
- [ ] I can view a list of open PRs needing my approval. Here's an [example query](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+draft%3Afalse+NOT+WIP+in%3Atitle+team-review-requested%3Adepartment-of-veterans-affairs%2Fbackend-review-group). Replace `backend-review-group` with your code-owning GitHub Team and modify the query as needed ([GH search docs](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests)).

## Communication and Collaboration

- [ ] I have met with the Community of Practice (CoP). (Reach out in the CoP Slack channel for a CoP meeting invite.)
- [ ] I have discussed my role as a PR approver with my team.
- [ ] I understand I can reach out in the CoP Slack channel with PR questions.

## Approval
- [ ] Approved by OCTO Engineering Leadership (comment with name of approver).
