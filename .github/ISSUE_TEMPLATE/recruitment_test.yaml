        This is a form that only uses primeria criteria. That means all the criteria selections below will apply to all your participants. 
        
        In other words, if you request for Black, Rural Veterans-- Perigean will aim to have every participant identify as a Black Veteran living in a rural location. If you want to submit a custom request and specify precise numbers for the demographics you're recruiting for, use our [custom form request instead](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/blob/master/research-plan-participant-criteria-update%202.md).

We can't guarantee we can recruit a custom category if it's not explicitly asked for in the [Veteran usability sign up form](https://veteranusability.us/), but Perigean can partner with your team to help.
