## About your initiative

### Which of these descriptions best fits the work we’ll partner on?
Select all that apply.
- [ ] Digitizing a new form
- [ ] Creating a new digital tool
- [ ] Updating an existing form or tool
- [ ] Translating a form or tool into Spanish
- [ ] Adding new unauthenticated content to VA.gov
- [ ] Updating existing unauthenticated content on VA.gov
- [ ] Something else:  `insert description`

### What's the nature of your initiative and desired outcomes?

`Tell us briefly about your work and the outcomes you’re aiming to achieve.`

## Collaboration timeframe

**Note:** We work on nearly every OCTO product and manage all unauthenticated content on VA.gov, so we will need to prioritize intake requests based on overall workload and VA and OCTO priorities.

### Is this work tied to a Congressional mandate, change in law or policy, or upcoming event with a specific deadline?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No
- [ ] I’m not sure

### Where are you at in your timeline?
Tell us briefly about what you're working on now (such as initial discovery, wireframing, or usability research planning) and add any known dates for upcoming milestones or deadlines.

`Enter your description here`

### Will you release this new product incrementally (for example, release to 25% of users to start)?

- [ ]  Yes
- [ ]  No
 
 **Note:** For an incremental launch, we use React widgets to display dynamic content. We'll need at least 2 weeks of extra time to coordinate the content for this and work with your engineer. [Learn more about our process for dynamic content](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/processes/dynamic-content-process.md). If your launch plans change, notify CAIA of the change as soon as possible so we can talk about how that will impact the timeline.

**If you are releasing incrementally:**
- **What dates do you anticipate starting and ending your incremental launch?** `Enter dates`
- **What is the name of your engineer who will build the React widget?** `Name`

## Collaboration cycle 

### Which phases of the collaboration cycle have you completed?
