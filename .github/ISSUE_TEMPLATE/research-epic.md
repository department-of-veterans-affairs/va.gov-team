## Issues to create within this Epic

```
- Create research plan
- Recruit participants
- Prepare [x] thing to be tested (for example: low-fi prototype, staging site, heroku page, paper prototype, card sort, tree test, chalkmark test, etc.)
- Create Conversation Guide
- Conduct Research Sessions (at a minimum, the team lead, PM, content person should join these sessions. FE/BE should also join!)
- Conduct Research Synthesis - should be conducted as a team, led by designer.
- Create & Lead Research Readout (at minimum, it is expected that the designer should do a readout at design meetings & for their team. If stakeholder readouts are needed, the team lead/PM are responsible for scheduling those. Designers should also plan to do research readouts at sprint planning.)
