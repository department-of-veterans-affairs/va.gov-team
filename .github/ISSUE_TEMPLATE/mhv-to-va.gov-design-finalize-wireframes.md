## :star2: User Story
As a designer, I want our final wireframes to reflect the latest changes so that they will accurately inform higher-res mockup designs.

## :star2: Tasks
- [ ] Create final mockups with callouts
- [ ] Decide: Should a content and accessibility review be part of this ticket or separate tickets due to scope?

## :star2: Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] UI review meeting with product/UX team for feature capabilities
- [ ] UI review meeting with engineering for layout and callouts (can be the same meeting as above)
- [ ] Wireframe available on Sketch Cloud
- [ ] If the wireframes apply to an error state or text message, then update the error message documentation in GitHub
