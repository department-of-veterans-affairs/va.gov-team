## About your initiative

### Which of these descriptions best fits the work we’ll partner on?
Select all that apply.
- [ ] Digitizing a new form
- [ ] Creating a new digital tool

### What's the nature of your initiative and desired outcomes?

`Tell us briefly about your work and the outcomes you’re aiming to achieve.`

## Collaboration timeframe

**Note:** We work on nearly every OCTO product and manage all unauthenticated content on VA.gov, so we will need to prioritize intake requests based on overall workload and VA and OCTO priorities.

### Is this work tied to a Congressional mandate, change in law or policy, or upcoming event with a specific deadline?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No
- [ ] I’m not sure

### Where are you at in your timeline?
Tell us briefly about what you're working on now (such as initial discovery, wireframing, or usability research planning) and add any known dates for upcoming milestones or deadlines.

`Enter your description here`

### Will you release this new product incrementally (for example, release to 25% of users to start)?

- [ ]  Yes
- [ ]  No
 
 *Note: **If you check yes, we’ll reach out to discuss details about the content in the react widget. We use these widgets to display entry points for new products to a certain percentage of users who visit our static pages. Please refer to this [GitHub reference](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/processes/dynamic-content-process.md) for dynamic content.
 
- [ ]  I acknowledge that if I change the launch to be incremental, or change it from incremental to 100%, I must notify CAIA of this change as there is additional work involved that may impact deadlines.

## Collaboration cycle 

### Which phases of the collaboration cycle have you completed?
Select all that apply.
- [ ] Design intent 
- [ ] Midpoint review 
- [ ] Staging 
- [ ] None. This initiative isn’t going through the collaboration cycle.

### Collaboration cycle ticket 

If you’re going through the collaboration cycle, provide your ticket number and link:
- **Ticket Number:** `xxxxxx`

## Supporting artifacts

## Next steps
- [ ] Post a link to this issue in the [#sitewide-content-sitewide-content-accessibility-ia](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/sitewide-content-accessibility-ia) slack channel and tag `@Terry Nichols`. We’ll reply within 24 hours to acknowledge receipt. We'll then review the artifacts in more detail and work with you to determine timing for collaboration. Depending on the work, we may schedule a kickoff meeting to better understand how we'll partner together.
