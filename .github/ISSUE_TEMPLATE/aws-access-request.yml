        1. Before being granted access, the individual for whom access is requested (the 'target individual') must either be listed on the [Platform Roster](https://vfs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AP/pages/1908834623/Platform+Roster) or have started your [Platform Orientation](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/Platform-Orientation.1877344532.html) and be listed as a team member in [Atlas](https://www.va.gov/atlas/product_directory/team_members)
        2. Change the **Title** to include target individual
        3. Add the label used by the target individual's team (eg: `BAH-526`)
        4. Validate that your E-QIP process has been started with your Vendor Onboarding Representative (listed below in a dropdown) and **attach** a screenshot of your E-QIP Transmittal Confirmation. If you have not started your E-QIP process, do NOT put in a request.
        5. Do not remove `operations` label or the `ops-access-request` label; this will notify the VSP Operations team of your request
        6. When the issue is closed you will be notified and can continue with on-boarding setup
