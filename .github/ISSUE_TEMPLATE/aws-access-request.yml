        1. Before being granted access, you will need to either be listed on the [Platform Roster](https://vfs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AP/pages/1908834623/Platform+Roster) or have started your [Platform Orientation](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/Platform-Orientation.1877344532.html) and be listed on the [VFS Roster](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11dpCJjhs007uC6CWJI6djy3OAvjB8rHB65m0Yj8HXIw/edit?folder=0ALlyxurHpUilUk9PVA#gid=2042046665)
        2. Change the **Title** to include your name
        3. Add the label used by your team (eg: `BAH-526`)
        4. Do not remove `operations` label or the `ops-access-request` label; this will notify the VSP Operations team of your request
        5. Add additional info as a comment after GitHub issue is created if you select 'Other' for any of the form inputs.
        6. When the issue is closed you will be notified and can continue with on-boarding setup
