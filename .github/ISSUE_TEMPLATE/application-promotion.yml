        **Please read before continuing**: This issue form is to request promotion of an application to EKS in higher environments.

        Once completed, the following will be provided:
          - `AppProject` in ArgoCD
          - GitHub teams to match the read-only and read/write permission sets for the application
          - Environment-specific directory in the [application-manifests repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vsp-infra-application-manifests/tree/main/apps) under the specified application
            - **If your application already exists in the application-manifests repository, it will need to follow the existing pattern (i.e. `apps/<application-name>/<env>`)**
