## User Email Address
_Provide email address(es) for user(s) requesting access to the Insights team on the DSVA Slack channel: #VSP-Analytics. Please also link this issue. Email addresses ending in `@gmail.com` _**may not**_ be used.

VA.gov users and external users with email accounts that are not Google based should select the option "Use my current email address instead"._

_If the user already has a Google account that is not yet linked to their VA.gov email, they can link it using [these instructions](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/176347?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)._
