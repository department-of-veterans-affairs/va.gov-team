# Request a Standard KPI Dashboard

## What this form is for

Use this template to request a KPI dashboard on Domo for your product. 

We are currently only supporting standardized dashboards for Forms, Content, & Search products. If you have another VA.gov product, please reach out to the Platform Analytics & Insights team on #vfs-platform-support. Please note that these dashboards will require additional data and design discovery, and will take additional time to deliver.

**Additional Info**

- Please use the [KPI Framework](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/analytics/Analytics%20Playbook/va-gov-platform-analytics-kpi-framework.pdf) for more information on the metrics used in the Standard KPI dashboards. 

- For additional info, read through the [How to Request a KPI Dashboard Documentation](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/analytics-monitoring/Analytics-customer-support-guidelines.1586823275.html#Analyticscustomersupportguidelines-4.RequestaKPIDashboardinDomo).

### Expected delivery timelines

Your KPI dashboard request will be added to the Platform Analytics & Insights team's customer support queue, and we expect tickets at the top of the queue to be pulled in every Platform Sprint Planning & Refinement (every Wednesday). We appreciate your patience.

- Once your ticket has been pulled into the Platform sprint, we expect to deliver your completed dashboard within the next 4 business days. Please use this ticket for any follow up questions.
