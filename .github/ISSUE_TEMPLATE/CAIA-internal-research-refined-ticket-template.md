## Research Sessions

> [!TIP]
> - Providing CAIA A11ys with the time slots in advance for AT users, will allow a11ys to avoid conflicts on the CAIA A11y Capacity Calendar, and reach out to other a11ys, should CAIA not be available. 
> - Providing CAIA A11ys with the technology and devices the users will be testing with, will allow CAIA to prepare in advance for the sessions.

CAIA A11ys will review the coverage needed, and self-assign, based on a11y availability.
