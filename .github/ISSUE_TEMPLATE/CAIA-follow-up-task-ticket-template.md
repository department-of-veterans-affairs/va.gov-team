# CAIA Follow-up Task Ticket
> [!WARNING]
> Do not use this ticket unless directed to do so by the CAIA team.

## Issue description
Use this ticket to request follow-up work on existing collaboration with the sitewide content, accessibility, and information architecture (CAIA) team.

## About your team

- **Team name**: 
- **Product name:** 
- **Product manager:**  
- **Link to original CAIA intake related to this work:** 

## Follow-up request
Describe the additional work needed and the outcomes you’re aiming to achieve.

## Will you release this new product incrementally (for example, release to 25% of users to start)?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

**Note** If you checked yes: Incremental launches require dynamic content. You'll need to ask your developer to build a React widget and provide CAIA with the ID code. CAIA will provide widget content and add the widget to your product’s static page. Please refer to this GitHub page for more information.

- [ ] I acknowledge that if I change the launch to be incremental, or change it from incremental to 100%, I must notify CAIA of this change as these additional steps will impact deadlines.
