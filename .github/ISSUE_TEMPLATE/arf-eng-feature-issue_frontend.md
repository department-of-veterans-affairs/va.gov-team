#### Accessibility (A11y) Testing 
- Refer to existing [VA design system](https://design.va.gov/components/form/)
- Test with either [WAVE](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh?hl=en-US&utm_source=ext_sidebar) or [AXE](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd?hl=en-US&utm_source=ext_sidebar) extension
- As you manually test, look for the following:
   - color contrast errors
   - keyboard navigation
     - When navigating with a keyboard, content should flow from left to right
   - heading order 
     - Headings should be in order, so h1, then h2, h3. This is so the screen reader can let the user know the natural order of the elements in page. The WAVE tool has a headings tab that will display the order.
   - proper tag elements
     - Since we are working with forms, make sure components have the proper tags, i.e.:
 <label for="lastName"...>Last Name</label> <input id="lastName"... />
- test with a screen reader 
  - Voiceover is built in with mac, use NVDA for windows
