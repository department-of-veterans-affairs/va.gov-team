# Request a New Standardized KPI Dashboard or an Update to an Existing Dashboard
## What this form is for

Use this ticket template to request a new standardized KPI dashboard or an update to an existing KPI dashboard on Domo for your product.

Standardized dashboards are currently available for [Forms](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/447193050?userId=853813555), [Content](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/426422632), & [Search](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/1964748112) products only. To see if you should request a standardized dashboard, check [Should I request a standardized KPI dashboard](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16mRcslbkWtW44rlsfQGXZnHtQ3GoLjn6GpFnd3Gvva8/edit#slide=id.p). If you’re not sure which dashboard(s) your product(s) qualify for, check the [Eligibility Dashboard](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/1550814739).

If your VA.gov product is not eligible for a standardized dashboard, you may be able to request an “edge case” dashboard. Please reach out to the Platform Analytics & Insights team on #vfs-platform-support for more information on this process.
