##  Testing Schedule
The testing schedule in this ticket was created to make sure we are collecting all of the information needed to track the research in this study. There can be, at times, multiple sources of information, and the goal will always be to link to the team's source of truth. 
- [ ] **Link to provided source of truth (ex. Slack Canvas, Google Sheet, etc.) requested in the parent ticket**
    - [x] If it is not provided, please insert the known testing schedule in this ticket. 
    - [ ] If the source of truth becomes available, remove the table in this ticket and link to source of truth. 

> [!TIP]
> Delete testing schedule if it is not needed.
