## Research Sessions

> [!TIP]
> - Providing ADE accessibility specialists with the time slots in advance for AT users will allow them to avoid conflicts on the ADE Capacity Calendar, and reach out to other specialists if ADE isn't available. 
> - Providing ADE accessibility specialists with the technology and devices the users will be testing with will allow us to prepare in advance for the sessions.
