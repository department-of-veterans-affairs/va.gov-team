## Description of end point
<!— Please include a description of the endpoint and context. Why is this endpoint needed? What service is it pulling from and where does it fit in the mobile app? The description should be more 
than a link to an issue.  —>


## Original issue(s)
department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team#0000


## Method Details
<!- Fill out as much of this as possible. If you do not know of it it requires some discovery, please indicate that.

- [ ] [ ] Method: POST_PUT_GET_DELETE_ETC?
- [ ] [ ] Body/Params: add json or schema here
- [ ] [ ] Response: What should it return? Is there a schema or do we need to decide once we have the payload shape?
- [ ] [ ] What existing endpoints/resources does it leverage: Does this use a known endpoint in vets-api or approximate that? Does it call an EVSS or VAOS endpoint? What is that endpoint or do we need to find it?
