## Steps to complete the Full Accessibility & 508 Audit: 
- [ ] VFS: Verify all accessibility defects that were identified at Staging Review have been fixed before requesting a full audit *(Platform understands that other teams may be accountable for fixing the defects identified at Staging Review. These defects are exempt and will not block a team from scheduling this touchpoint)*
- [ ] VFS Product Manager: Create this issue and fill in your team and feature name in the title
- [ ] VFS: Using the Slack Workflow ([User guide](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/support/Getting-help-from-the-Platform-in-Slack.1439138197.html)), notify Collaboration Cycle team of this Github ticket in #vfs-platform-support. 
- [ ] Platform: Create sub-issues attached to this epic with findings. Audits are performed on a first-come-first-serve basis and are scheduled with each biweekly sprint.
- [ ] VFS: Coordinate and address accessibility findings with VA's 508 office.
- [ ] Platform: Update [Platform Collaboration Point Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OgPyEvUlNF6EnaYMFAXJkV6FKOvZnlPnbOQ2fAJ7W7A/edit#gid=1116695886)
- [ ] VFS: Close this ticket when all steps above are completed.
