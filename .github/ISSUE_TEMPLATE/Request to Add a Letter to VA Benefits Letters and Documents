        # Request to Add a Letter to VA Benefits Letters and Documents

        ## What this form is for

        This form helps teams propose new letters for inclusion in **VA Benefits Letters and Documents** — the secure, self-service tool on VA.gov where Veterans and other claimants can view, generate, and download official VA correspondence related to their benefits, service, and eligibility.

        ## How it works

        Letters in this tool are generated from backend services through API endpoints. Each letter must follow VA's eligibility logic and include user-facing content for display on VA.gov.

        By completing this form, you'll help us determine:

        - Whether VA Benefits Letters and Documents is the right place for claimants to access this letter  
        - What technical dependencies or work are needed to support it  
        - Which teams will own delivery, review, and ongoing maintenance  

        ## What happens next

        After you submit this form, our team will review your request and follow up within **[X business days]** to discuss next steps and feasibility.

        **Questions?** Contact **[team contact info]** or reach out in **[Slack channel]**.
