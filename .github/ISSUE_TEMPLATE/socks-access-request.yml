        1. Before being granted access, you will need to either be listed as a team member in [Atlas](https://vfs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AP/pages/1908834623/Platform+Roster) or have started your [Platform Orientation](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/Platform-Orientation.1877344532.html) and be listed on the [VFS Roster](https://www.va.gov/atlas/product_directory/team_members)
        2. Change the **Title** to include your name
        3. Add the label used by your team (eg: `BAH-526`)
        4. Attach a screenshot of your E-QIP Transmittal Confirmation. If you have not started your E-QIP process, do NOT put in a request.
        5. Do not remove `operations` label or the `ops-access-request` label; this will notify the VSP Operations team of your request
        6. When the issue is closed you will be notified and can continue with on-boarding setup

        This issue can also be used to update existing access, including updating ssh-keys or changing the access type group you are in.
