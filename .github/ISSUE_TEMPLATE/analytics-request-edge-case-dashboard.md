# Request an Edge Case KPI Dashboard

## What this form is for

Use this ticket template to request a new edge case KPI dashboard on Domo for your product. Edge case dashboards are for products that fall outside of the scope of our standardized KPI dashboards [Forms](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/447193050), [Content](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/426422632) and [Search](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/1964748112).

If you are unsure what type of dashboard your product qualifies for, please check the [Eligibility Dashboard](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/1550814739) on Domo.

### Expected delivery timelines

The Analytics team will notify you once this ticket has been pulled into a sprint. Please note that these dashboards will require additional data and design discovery and will take additional time to deliver. You can also reach out for updates on this ticket.

## Instructions for the VFS team

  - [ ] Fill out product information basics.
  - [ ] If a part of your product involves any sort of linear process/funnel for which you want to be able to measure conversions, please include it in the "Forms" tab of the template.
  - [ ] All other pages associated with your product for which you'd want to track visits and engagement should be added to the "Content" tab.
- [ ] Link to your completed spreadsheet here:________
