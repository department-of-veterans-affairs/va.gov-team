## Collaboration timeframe

We work on nearly every OCTO product and manage all unauthenticated content on VA.gov, so we will need to prioritize intake requests based on overall workload and VA and OCTO priorities.

### Your timeline 
- [ ] Check yes, if this request is tied to a Congressional mandate or timeline?

### Will you release this new product incrementally (for example, release to 25% of users to start)?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

**Note: **If you checked yes, we’ll reach out to discuss details about the content in the react widget (we use these widgets to display entry points for new products to a certain percentage of users who visit our static pages). Please refer to this [GitHub reference](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/processes/dynamic-content-process.md) for dynamic content.

- [ ] I acknowledge that if I change the roll out of this product to be incremental, or change it from incremental to 100%, I must notify CAIA of this change as there is additional work involved that may impact deadlines. 

### Description
**Describe where you are in your project's timeline.** 
_For example, you may be drafting content, planning or synthesizing research, waiting on an SME review, or scheduling your MVP launch date. Add dates for any upcoming milestones._
