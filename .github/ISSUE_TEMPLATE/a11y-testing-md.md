# Accessibility Testing Artifact

## 1. Introduction

This issue template will help walk you through [required and recommended accessibility testing](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/prepare-for-an-accessibility-staging-review) and will generate a testing artifact you can submit as part of your staging review. Try to resolve as many issues as you're able to before your staging review, and update this artifact with that progress. Log any issues you find (see 4. Next Steps).
        
### Why we ask VFS teams to do accessibility testing
The more you test and fix issues before your staging review, the less likely we are to find launch-blocking issues. This artifact helps document your accessibility testing efforts and any issues you found along the way. It also helps us understand your product better before we do our review.

## 2. Before you begin

The Required and Recommended checklists below are based on WCAG 2.2 and the [VA.gov Accessibility Standards](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/accessibility/va-gov-accessibility-standards).

Complete all required checks and as many recommended checks as you can. If you can't complete a required check, please explain why as a comment on this ticket.

### Product information
- [ ] Team name, product name, and feature name have been added to the title of this issue.
- [ ] Team label, product label and feature label (if applicable) have been added to this issue.

## 3. Accessibility Checklist (Required + Recommended Items)
- If you find an issue while performing a check, mark that item as "Fail".
- You may find multiple issues while performing a single check. Every check should be tested on every page of your flow.
- For every fail, log the issue (see 4. Next steps)
- If the check is not applicable to your product, mark it as passed.
- Each checklist item includes a "How to test" link. Use this guidance to inform your testing. If you have additional questions, please post as a comment on this ticket and/or reach out to ADE or other accessibility specialists.
