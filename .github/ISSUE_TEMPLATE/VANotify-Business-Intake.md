### VA Notify:  Important Scheduling Information
As we approach the end of the year, please note that VA Notify will ***not*** be starting any new notification intakes after November 15th. Our focus will be on supporting in-progress notifications, urgent zero silent failure use cases, and completing 2024 initiatives. Kick-off meetings for new intake forms submitted ***after November 15th*** will be scheduled in January.

***Important Reminder:*** Please be mindful of launching new notifications before the holidays unless there is a business-critical deadline. There will be a ***VA platform code freeze 12/23/2024 - 1/3/2025***, with limited support during this time.

If you have any other urgent needs that require attention before the end of the year, please reach out as soon as possible for review.
