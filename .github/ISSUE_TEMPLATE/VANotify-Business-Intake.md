## IMPORTANT: Year-End Intake Pause & Shutdown Impact

As we approach the end of the year, please note the following.

### Intake pause:
VA Notify will not start new notification intakes after November 15. Our focus will shift to in-progress notifications and completing 2025 initiatives. New intake forms submitted after November 15 will be scheduled for January 2026 kickoffs.

### Holiday launches:
Once the government reopens, teams may continue to push approved notifications to production. However, please avoid launching new notifications right before the holidays unless there’s a business-critical deadline. The VA platform code freeze runs [December 22, 2025 – January 5, 2026](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/deployment-policies#DeploymentPolicies-Holidayreleasefreezeschedule), with limited support during that period. If you have urgent needs that must be addressed before year end, please reach out as soon as possible for review.

### Government shutdown:
Please note that during the ongoing government shutdown the current processes remain in effect:
Discovery and staging work can continue.
Edits to existing notifications that are in-production are allowed.
We are unable to accommodate new phone number requests (short code, 10DLC).
New notification templates must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis before moving to production. Please contact us ASAP for evaluation of your business case.
If you have questions about our Year-End Intake Pause and/or government shutdown processes please contact us.
