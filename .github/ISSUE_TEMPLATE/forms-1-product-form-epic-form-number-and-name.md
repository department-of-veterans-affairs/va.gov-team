## **High Level User Story**


## **Hypothesis or Bet**
**If** we make this change **then** we expect to reduce the burden time it takes for the application to get to the business line to process it.
Create a better user and accessibility experience filling out an online application rather than a PDF

## **OKR**
As part of the IDEA Act, we are prioritizing forms that have the low complexity to build / high frequency of use and high impact to Veterans. 

## **Definition of done**

- [ ] The form will be available to fill out online from Find a Form and sent to Central Mail for processing.
