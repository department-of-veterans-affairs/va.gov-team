# Template Instructions
You are here to create or change a 'search recommendation' (also called a Best Bet, for the system used to manage them) on VA.gov. A [search recommendation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/standards/search-best-bets.md) enables a designated link to show up in the "Our top recommendations for you" section on va.gov/search/ . Not all links have a search recommendation -- the CAIA IA team has a set of criteria to apply when determining why to set them up, so we might suggest a different way to elevate your page! 

### 1. Select Request Type:

- [ ] NEW: You would like to create a new search recommendation
- [ ] CHANGE: You would like to change an existing search recommendation

### 2. Which page do you want to set up a search recommendation for?
What is the URL of your page? You can list multiple in one ticket.


### 3. Why do you want to set up or change a search recommendation?
Include any research or data you have to support the request. 


### 4. Any timing we should be aware of?
 Is the page currently live? If not, when is it launching? Do you have any target dates we should be aware of?

### 5. Notify CAIA
Post a link to this issue in Slack Channel #sitewide-content-accessibility-ia.
