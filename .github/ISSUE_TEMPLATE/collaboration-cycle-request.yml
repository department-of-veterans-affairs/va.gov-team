        The [Collaboration Cycle](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/) is where teams who are building products on VA.gov get feedback and guidance on their product/feature to ensure it meets VA.gov experience standards. Teams engage with the Collaboration Cycle throughout their productâ€™s/feature's lifecycle.
