## Background
As a team, we are being asked to project target dates for this feature (see example in this [slack thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C022AC2STBM/p1701354024613449)). 

In order to do this, we need for the engineers to have a complete understanding of the feature and have time to define and estimate task tickets. Our GitHub roadmap will then offer a predicted target date.

## Tasks
- [ ] Understand the complete scope of the feature represented by this Epic and outlined in the [Sketch files]()
     - [ ] Get questions answered by UX, as needed
     - [ ] Document answers to questions
- [ ] Design the implementation (may or may not include sequence or container diagrams)
- [ ] Create **all** frontend & backend task tickets needed to complete the feature
- [ ] Estimate **all** frontend & backend task tickets 
- [ ] Document any assumptions or concessions that must be made that may affect the predicted target date
- [ ] Do a final review to ensure all tickets have been created
