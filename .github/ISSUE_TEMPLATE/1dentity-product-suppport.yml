            Does your application interact with end users, API’s or both?<br />
            <ul>
              <li><em>If end users interact with your application, you will most likely need to <a href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Products/Sign-In%20Service/Engineering%20Docs/configuration/client_config.md">configure your integration as a client application</a>.</em></li>
              <li><em>If end users don’t interact with your application, your integration will likely need to be <a href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Products/Sign-In%20Service/Engineering%20Docs/configuration/service_account.md">configured as a service account</a>.</em></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Do you need to use our <a href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Products/Unified%20Sign%20In%20Pages/README.md">Unified Sign-in Page</a> (USiP)?
          </li>
          <li>
            If your application is used by end users, is it used in a web browser?<br />
            <ul>
              <li><em>If so, your application will need <a href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Products/Sign-In%20Service/Engineering%20Docs/auth_flows/cookie_oauth.md">cookie-based authentication</a>.</em></li>
              <li>If not, your application will need to <a href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Products/Sign-In%20Service/Engineering%20Docs/auth_flows/api_oauth.md">authenticate via API</a>.</em></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Is your authentication facilitated by a frontend or a secure backend?<br />
            <ul>
              <li><em>If frontend reference the appropriate authentication guide in Step #3 and complete the step for PKCE authentication.</em></li>
              <li><em>If backend, reference the authentication guide, but register a public certificate for <a href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Products/Sign-In%20Service/Engineering%20Docs/auth_flows/private_key_jwt.md">private key JWT authentication</a>.</em></li>
