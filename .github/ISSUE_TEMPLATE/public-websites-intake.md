# WIP

### Instructions
- VSA apps teams should submit this intake request when you need support or work that needs to be fulfilled by the Public Website team. Examples of support we provide include: content support for benefit hub static pages; content support for authenticated application or tools; FE engineering implementation of redirects that have first been vetted by the IA team in Platform. The team's capacity and the type of request will determine which sprint the work falls into.

__When to submit a request issue__
Make your request as soon as you're aware you will need public website participation. Different types of requests may require more time in advance. For apps tool content support, try to engage a content person for your project kick-off.

### Description
*Detailed description of the request including background information and reason for the request*

 1. Is the request related to a VA.gov tool? If yes provide brief description of the tool or funcitionality: 
 3. Is this an iteration to an existing tool?  [Not sure why this detail is needed - ??? let's verify w/FE and Content if this detail is used.] 
 5. Provide a link to product brief or outline: 
 6. Provide a link to wireframes, prototype: 
 7. Provide a link to any user research synthesis: 


### Desired/target implementation date
Is there an ETA for a particular launch or completion date when request needs to be completed (for instance, for a user research session or eBenefits migration)?


### Type of support request
*Select one*  [are there situations where a team needs both FE and content support? I don't know, so asking.]

In addition to the above general information, include:
      1. Word document with draft if available, or link to the URL where the draft content appears:
      2. Provide design context: (Example: Is this content in a user flow, an in-line error message, tool tip, field label?)
      3. Scope: How many screens? (Or messages, etc.) 
      
      
- [ ] Content support for a static public website page

      1. Is this to update existing static content? 
      2. Does this need a new static tool landing page? (The public website team may propose a different approach in consultation with the information architect.)
      2. Provide clear instructions of what page needs to be updated, what the new info should be, and what it is replacing.
      3. Are there redirects that will be needed, and if so do you have a proposed IA and URL from Content / IA team? [@kara - NOT SURE WHY THIS DETAIL IS EMBEDDED IN THIS SECTION. DON'T WE ALREADY HAVE A REDIRECT REQUEST PROCESS IN PLACE?
