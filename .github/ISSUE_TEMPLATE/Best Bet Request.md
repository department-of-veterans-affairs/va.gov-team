# Template Instructions
You are here to create or change a Best Bet on VA.gov. A [best bet](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/standards/search-best-bets.md) enables a designated link to show up as a 'top recommendation' on va.gov/search/ . Not all links have a best bet -- the CAIA IA team has a set of criteria to apply when determining best bets, so we might suggest a different way to elevate your page! 

### 1. Select Request Type:

- [ ] NEW: You would like to create a new best bet
- [ ] CHANGE: You would like to change an existing best bet

### 2. Which page do you want to set up a best bet for?
What is the URL of your page? You can list multiple in one ticket.


### 3. Why do you want to set up or change a best bet?
Include any research or data you have to support the request. 


### 4. Any timing we should be aware of?
 Is the page currently live? If not, when is it launching? Do you have any target dates we should be aware of?

### 5. Notify CAIA
Post a link to this issue in Slack Channel #sitewide-content-ia and tag @Kristin Ouellette Muskat
