## Feedback
Practice areas will document their feedback on the VFS-provided artifacts following the [Must, Should, and Consider Framework](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/must-should-and-consider-framework-for-feedback). Platform reviewers may also provide additional notes that donâ€™t comment on the artifacts themselves but are important for implementation (eg. engineering/coding notes).
