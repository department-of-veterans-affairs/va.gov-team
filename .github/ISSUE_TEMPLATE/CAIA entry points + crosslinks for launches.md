# CAIA Internal Collaboration 

`WIP`

This ticket is designed to coordinate IA and content tasks for **PRODUCT UPDATES** to update `mega menu`, `left nav`, and `hub pages` in Drupal.  

## Issue Description
_What details are necessary for understanding the specific work or request tracked by this issue?_


---
## Tasks
- [ ] IA works with product team and CAIA writer to identify entry points and suggested crosslinks
- [ ] IA documents plan in IA Spec in the [IA Spec folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/information-architecture/ia-design-docs) on github
- [ ] IA adds the IA spec to the intake ticket for the product team, tags Lily/Megan 
- [ ] Lily ensures IA spec is included in content entry point [ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/CAIA%20entry%20points%20+%20crosslinks%20for%20launches.md) for Megan
- [ ] Lily confirms whether work requires a writer (or if writer is already involved), or SME review. Criteria: Any surrounding content change besides replacing PDF link with online form link
- [ ] Content writer notifies Megan/Chelsea when itâ€™s time to implement
- [ ] If staged rollout: Content publishes the main static page or landing page with the react widget and DOES NOT implement entry points or crosslinks. 
- [ ] Once a product is launched to 100% of users (staged rollout or not), content will take out the widget and put the rest of the entry points/crosslinks in in Drupal and publish. 
- [ ] Publish
- [ ] Megan or Chelsea will add Kristin or Jenny as an assignee to the entry point ticket
- [ ] Content will let IA know final decisions on crosslinks and why, so IA can document
- [ ] IA will check live site for accuracy of implementation, compared to IA spec
- [ ] Kristin OR Jenny will update sitemaps with color coding to show product/change was implemented

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Updated pages are live
- [ ] IA review complete
- [ ] Sitemaps update
