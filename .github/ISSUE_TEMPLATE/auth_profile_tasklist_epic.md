## Problem Statement– 
_What challenge are we addressing? (This is already in a lot of the cards as Veteran problems and possibly business problems to solve._

## Why Is This Important?
_– The significance and impact of solving this problem._

## Solution (Bet)– 
_What we plan to deliver to address the problem. (this is probably a 2-sentence summary of the bet we're making/what we're going to deliver. Arguably it's "Title of card not in OCTO-speak" but let's not die on that hill on titling because it's often what makes sense to the teams building, but not necessarily our leadership or stakeholders)_

## Results or Impact– 
_The outcomes, improvements, or key metrics.- What do we expect to happen and how do we expect to measure the success of this bet?- What is the baseline data?- What data sources are we/will we be looking at to determine success/failure_

## What OCTO/DE?Crew OKR does this map to?
