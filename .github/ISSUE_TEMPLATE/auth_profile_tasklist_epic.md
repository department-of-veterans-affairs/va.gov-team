## Objective/Problem we are trying to solve:  
_Brief 2-3 sentence description of the outcome we hope to achieve with this effort. Note: this is the outcome, not what we're delivering - what we are delivering is the solution_


## Why Is This Important?
_Brief 2-3 sentence explanation of why this is important/impactful_

## Solution (Bet)– 
_What we plan to deliver to address the problem. (this is probably a 2-sentence summary of the bet we're making/what we're going to deliver. Arguably it's "Title of card not in OCTO-speak" but let's not die on that hill on titling because it's often what makes sense to the teams building, but not necessarily our leadership or stakeholders)_

## Results or Impact– 
_The outcomes, improvements, or key metrics.- What do we expect to happen and how do we expect to measure the success of this bet?- What is the baseline data?- What data sources are we/will we be looking at to determine success/failure -How are we measuring success? Where will we get the data from? If possible make sure to capture the "before" baseline measure_

## What OCTO/DE?Crew OKR does this map to?
_Add any OKRs, including year and full text, that this initiative maps to (if any). Be intellectually honest - don't force a square peg into a round hole. Not everything will map and that's OK._
