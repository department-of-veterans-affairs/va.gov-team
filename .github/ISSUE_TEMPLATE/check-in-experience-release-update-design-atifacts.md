## Description
Update sketch wireframes so that they match what we are releasing and prepare them for merging to Abstract main and VA Sketch Cloud.

## Tasks
- Validate that final sketches match what we are pushing to production
     - Update sketches if they don't match but what we are pushing is correct
     - Notify FE if there was something missed and the sketches are correct
- Prepare Abstract collection so that it can be merged when we go to production
