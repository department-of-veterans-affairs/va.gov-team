### Notes

## Endpoint Path
_vets-api endpoint path here. Like: /travel_pay/v0/endpoint-name_

## Response Schema
_vets-api endpoint response schema here. Include translations, serializations, transformations_
_e.g._
```
{
  claims: [
    {

```

## External Dependencies
- _What dependencies are required?_
- _What is the highest env they are in?_
- _What would be nice to have from this depenency?_
