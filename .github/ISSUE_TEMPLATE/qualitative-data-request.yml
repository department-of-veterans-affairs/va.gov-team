          The Contact Center Team is responsible for tier 2/3 support as well as Medallia User Surveys (among other things) along with associated and data and reporting. Please use this form to request qualitative (textual) data for either. While we have quantitative data for these services within DOMO, we are only able to share the qualitative data on the network due to PII/PHI concerns.
