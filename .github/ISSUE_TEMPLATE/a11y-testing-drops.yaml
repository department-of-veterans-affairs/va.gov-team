        This issue template will help walk you through [required and recommended accessibility testing](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/prepare-for-an-accessibility-staging-review) and will generate a testing artifact you can submit as part of your staging review. Try to resolve as many issues as possible before your staging review. Then update this artifact with your progress. Log any issues you find. Guidance for logging issues is available in the "4. Next steps" section of this ticket.
        
        ### Why we ask VFS teams to do accessibility testing
        The more you test and fix issues before your staging review, the less likely we are to find launch-blocking issues. This artifact helps document your accessibility testing efforts and any issues you found along the way. It also helps us understand your product better before we do our review.
