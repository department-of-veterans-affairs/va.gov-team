      value: |
        This issue template will help walk you through [required and recommended accessibility testing](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/prepare-for-an-accessibility-staging-review) and will generate a testing artifact you can submit as part of your staging review. Try to resolve as many issues as you're able to before your staging review, and update this artifact with that progress. Log any issues you find (see #5 Next Steps).
        
        ### Why we ask VFS teams to do accessibility testing
        The more you test and fix issues before your staging review, the less likely we are to find launch-blocking issues. This artifact helps document your accessibility testing efforts and any issues you found along the way. It also helps us understand your product better before we do our review.

        ## 2. Before you begin

        The Required and Recommended checklists below are based on WCAG 2.2 and the [VA.gov Accessibility Standards](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/accessibility/va-gov-accessibility-standards).

        The full checklist can be found in the [Prepare for an accessibility staging review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/prepare-for-an-accessibility-staging-review) documentation.

        Complete all required checks and as many recommended checks as you can. If you can't complete a required check, please explain why in the comments.
