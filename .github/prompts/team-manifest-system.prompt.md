# Team Manifest System Prompt - Moved to Private Repository

## ⚠️ This Prompt Has Been Relocated

The comprehensive team manifest system prompt has been moved to the private repository to align with the migration of team-sensitive content.

**New Location**: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/.github/prompts/team-manifest-system.prompt.md

## For VA Team Members

Access the full team manifest system prompt in the private repository where it contains:
- Complete system overview and component details
- Template structure and parsing logic
- Validation patterns and testing procedures
- Comprehensive guidance for team manifest updates

## For External Contributors

Team manifest functionality in the public repository is now limited to:
- Reading existing team documentation that remains public
- Accessing product information in `/products/` directory
- Using platform documentation and public resources

For questions about team documentation or manifest system, reach out in [#vfs-all-teams](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/vfs-all-teams).
