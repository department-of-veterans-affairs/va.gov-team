## Scenario 1
I go directly to a URL that I've saved for a pre Nov-2018 VA.gov page, but it has been replaced with a new VA.gov page hosted on the VFT.

**Experience:** I'm redirected seamlessly to the correct new VA.gov page.

**Implementation**: 
- [Prepare stakeholders for all VA.Gov redirects (all - www., cem., and benefits.)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/13948)
- [Redirect specific Teamsite-hosted pages to the new corresponding VA.gov page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/13635)

## Scenario 2
I go directly to a URL that I've saved for a Vets.gov page, and there is a corresponding page for it on VA.gov.

**Experience:** I'm redirected seamlessly to the specific VA.gov page, and when it loads I see a message alerting me to the fact that Vets.gov has been merged into VA.gov. 

**Implementation:**
- [Build Vets.gov to VA.gov page redirects with onboarding modal](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/12060)
- [Set Vets.gov to VA.gov redirect onboarding modal to happen every time, until we disable](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/14556)
- [Redirect Specific Vets.Gov Pages to corresponding new VA.gov pages](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/13928)

## Scenario 3
I go directly to a URL that I've saved for a Vets.gov page, and there is NO corresponding page for it on VA.gov.

**Experience:** I'm redirected seamlessly to the VA.gov home page, and when it loads I see a message alerting me to the fact that Vets.gov has been merged into VA.gov.

**Implementation:**
- ?
