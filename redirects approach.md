## Scenario 1
I go directly to a URL that I've saved for a pre Nov-2018 VA.gov page, but it has been replaced with a new VA.gov page hosted on the VFT.

**Experience:** I'm redirected seamlessly to the correct new VA.gov page.

## Scenario 2
I go directly to a URL that I've saved for a Vets.gov page, and there is a corresponding page for it on VA.gov.

**Experience:** I'm redirected seamlessly to the specific VA.gov page, and when it loads I see a message alerting me to the fact that Vets.gov has been merged into VA.gov. 

## Scenario 3
I go directly to a URL that I've saved for a Vets.gov page, and there is NO corresponding page for it on VA.gov.

**Experience:** I'm redirected seamlessly to the VA.gov home page, and when it loads I see a message alerting me to the fact that Vets.gov has been merged into VA.gov.
