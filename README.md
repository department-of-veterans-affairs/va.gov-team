## Executive Summary 

### Objective

Articulate a clear vision for a unified Veteran digital experience and propose an execution plan to accomplish it.
- Consider input from all stakeholders
- Develop success metrics for each stage or phase


### Success

By Veterans Day 2018:
- An updated VA.gov home page that has Veterans needs as its focus
- Veterans can log in from VA.gov
- A few clicks from the home page to get the top Veteran-focused transactional tools
- Increase in top-of-funnel traffic to the top Veteran-focused transactional tools

### The Problem

Veterans do not have a single place to find, apply for, and manage their health care and benefits.
- Veterans have to navigate 6 main VA websites to find what they need (VA.gov, Vets.gov, My HealtheVet, eBenefits, Cemeteries, Explore)
- Veterans have to use 3 different log in credentials to access VA’s online tools and services
- More than 10 million people access VA’s digital properties each month


### The Vision

Merge VA’s diffuse web properties into VA.gov and mask the siloed nature of the organization from users.
- VA.gov home page becomes the single place for people to discover, learn about, apply for, track, and manage their VA benefits and services.
- Helps realize the Digital Modernization Vision to have the best online experience in the federal government (defined in July 2017 by the Digital Modernization Working Group)
- Helps realize the CTO’s top 2018 priority to make VA’s online experience match that of a typical Fortune 500 company


### Our Vision

DSVA is leading the research and design activities for 2018, in partnership with a working group.
- Created a Web Brand Consolidation Working Group in February 2018, a sub-committee of VA’s Web Governance Board, which is meeting bi-monthly for the rest of 2018 to collaborate on solutions
- Working group agreed on solving these top problems for 2018:
1. Veterans can’t find what they need
2. Navigation between VA sites is a disjointed experience
3. VA.gov is not organized for users
4. No one knows who owns a “merged VA”
- Will usability test different VA.gov home page options with Veterans to find the best solution
- Will work with new and/or existing contractors to build initial solution for 2018

### Our Timeline

By Veterans Day 2018, Veterans will be able to find top self-service tools and benefits information on the VA.gov home page.
- Feb. – May. 2018: DSVA leads research and design activities in partnership with working group
- June – Oct. 2018: Software developers build solution for 2018 (more work will likely continue into 2019 and beyond)
- Nov. 11, 2018: New VA.gov home page launches
