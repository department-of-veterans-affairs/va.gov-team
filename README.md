# VA.gov Team Repository
*Last updated: [9/17/2019](#document-history)*

This project aims to improve the lives of Veterans, their families, and their caregivers by facilitating the creation of interactive experiences on VA.gov on par with the private sector. It's comprised of a platform (the Veteran-facing Services Platform, aka VSP) which serves as the common framework for building cohesive products on VA.gov, and the VA.gov products themselves (the Veteran Facing Services, aka VFSs).

This repository is used to store *non-code* documents and files created and used by teams building the VSP and VFSs.

***An important note about security for contributors to this repository: this is a public, open source space! Which means it's great for collaborating, but decidedly not great for storing sensitive information (like credentials, PII, etc). So be mindful as you work in this repo. Don't store anything sensitive here!***

For information on how to use this repo, see the [Repo Guidelines](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/orientation/repo-guidelines.md).
