# Design & Forms Systems team Charter

## How we work

### Workflow + Cadence

#### Stand-up

Check in on people and product progress

- Monday at 11:45am ET. Wed/Thurs at Noon ET, Tues/Fri async
- 15 min
- Review issues in progress or review/QA to discuss what has been done and if there are any blockers

#### Retro + Sprint Planning/Grooming

During retro, the team review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, what can be improved, what questions people have, and any action items. During planning we outline work to be done this sprint in order to accomplish the team's goals

- Retro: Monday after the sprint ends

  - 60 minutes

- Planning: Monday the first day of every sprint at noon ET

  - 60 mins

- Grooming

  - The team assesses and updates the workload for the sprint

  - 2nd Monday of every sprint at noon ET

  - 60 mins

#### Demos to OCTO PO

- Every other Friday on the last day of the sprint at 2:30pm ET

#### Issue Etiquette

For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the "Standard Issue Template"):

- Estimate (when possible)
- Title that explains task
- Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria (optional)
- Labels: platform-design-system-team (add appropriate corresponding labels to the ticket for example: "va-textinput", "dst-engineering" or "dst-design")
- User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
- Nested in an Epic

All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

#### Team Norms

- Be respectful, both online and off
- Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
- Speak up! - everyone's voice matters
- We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
- Let's have fun and do great work!

#### Slack

This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.

Private Team Slack channel: #design-system-forms

Public Design System Slack channel: #platform-design-system or #veteran-facing-forms

#### GitHub

GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.

#### General things

- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub
