## How We Work

While each team works differently due to its mission, make-up and team-member preference as outlined in their charter, here are key commonalities and helpful guidance about how we work.

#### Transparency
The more we can transparently articulate our decision-making process, the more others will be on the same page. While it's impossible for everyone to agree all the time, there's value in the notion of "disagree and commit". A clear direction (that everyone collectively throws their weight behind) creates unified momentum. This is powerful, and it won't happen if we can't or won't work transparently.
In addition, we should be transparent about how we work as individuals, so that we can understand how best to engage and help each other.

#### Trust
We should operate from the base assumption that our colleagues have the best of intentions. It can be easy to interpret an interaction as combative, defensive, or territorial. At times, you might fear your opinion won't be heard - or that it might be rejected. If we start from a place of goodwill and trust - that we are equally invested in the mission of our work - we can begin to put these concerns aside. Over time, this will foster a healthy, collaborative environment.

#### Collaboration
As Product Owners, our role is to enable success (rather than to dictate how it's achieved). We should empower the people in various roles to make decisions incumbent on those roles, rather than make decisions on their behalf. This is done through open collaboration and sharing of ideas and information.

#### Support
We strive to support each other and the larger team as our specific strengths can lend themselves. We should not think of our responsibilities as clear lines drawn in the sand. If there is a problem we can help the team or each other with (even if outside the boundaries of our direct responsibilities), we should exert our best to lend support as needed.

#### Core responsibilities
For leadership roles (such as Product Owner), it's common to struggle with knowing the optimal level of involvement in the many work efforts you are responsible for. The below core responsibilities aim to provide guidance and assurance around this, within the context of how we work as Product Owners on the Lighthouse program.

 - Identify and evolve product opportunities
   - A key function of our job is to ensure the teams are enabled to solve the right problems. This doesn't mean we dictate the problems to solve - we have UX and research to bear out our hunches. What it does mean is that we are responsible for identifying gaps and opportunities, and bringing those opportunities to the teams by providing as much relevant information as possible. From there, the team can perform discovery activities (such as user research, technical research, and product opportunity definition) to assess the impact of that gap or opportunity, and narrow the field of possible solutions to recommend the best path or paths toward solving the most critical problems.
   - How: Engage stakeholders, be attentive to problems gleaned through research, remain plugged in to other VA initiatives that may inform our work or present unanticipated opportunities. Communicate product opportunities to Product Managers and team leads, provide as much context as possible by filling out the Product Opportunity Template.

- Manage priorities
  - As Product Owners, we are the "eyes and ears" within VA for the product delivery teams. With this position comes knowledge and intel that may not be available to the delivery teams. That's why we work closely with them to set product direction and priorities. As stated above, this is not an exercise in dictating what the priorities are. However, it should be clear that the VA Product Owner gets final say in all priority decisions. To the extent possible, we should arrive at these decisions through two-way conversation and under mutual agreement (or disagree and commit).
  - There may be less than ideal reasons for prioritizing one thing over the other, but these reasons need to be communicated clearly to avoid friction or misunderstanding within the team.
  - How: Work with sprint teams to ensure alignment on priorities through 1x1s with Product Managers and leads, and by attending leadership meetings, team standups when relevant, and cross-team prioritization meetings, and by gathering and articulating relevant context.

- Enable delivery
  - It is not our job as Product Owners to be in the weeds of daily delivery. That's the job of the Product Managers on the many delivery teams, and Product Leads overseeing those teams. The more we can stay out of the weeds and trust the teams to deliver, the more they will be enabled and empowered to succeed. How do we do this? Product Owners enable and empower delivery by ensuring broad context and possible constraints are clearly communicated and understood.
  - It is also our job to collaborate with Product Managers and Leads to determine measurable success metrics aligned to team and program north stars. This will set clear boundaries on effective product delivery, and set clear expectations accordingly.
  - How: Identify/mitigate anticipated blockers or internal VA dynamics at play on various initiatives, provide context on prior implementation or program-level decisions and why they were made, provide information that delivery teams need to know to do their job effectively. This should be identified and clearly communicated by Product Owners through the most relevant channel (direct/real-time, Confluence wiki, meetings, etc).

- Report up
  - As leaders on a large program, a big part of our job is knowing when to escalate risks and/or blockers, and when to share good news about progress being made. As such, it's important that we coordinate communications with the executive level. Executive leadership is incredibly busy -- so we should take care to not over-engage, especially for things that ultimately might not ever concern them. 
  - How: Coordinate with the Public Websites PO to manage communications with VA executive leadership

 - Build and maintain stakeholder relationships
   - VA is a large, complex organization. Often, the hardest part of our job is not technical implementation. Rather, it is navigating organizational friction to ensure we can do our work. No matter how great a product we are working on might seem on paper, and no matter how easy it might seem to push through, there are always organizational complexities at play - timelines and budgets and agendas at odds with ours, or competing priorities that may supersede another team's ability to support us where needed.

Forming and nurturing relationships with stakeholders across VA is a critical component of helping our teams deliver. Not only can such relationships help us deliver in the present, they can open doors to new opportunities in the future - opportunities that may have been impossible to anticipate. These relationships will go a long way to enabling future success; strong partnerships mean there will be an appetite for future collaboration on other problems that need solving.

While it will take time to know who to turn to for specific needs, it is important that Product Owners form solid relationships with leaders across the agency who will empower and enable us to succeed.
