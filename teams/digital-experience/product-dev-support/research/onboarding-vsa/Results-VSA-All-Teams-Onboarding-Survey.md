11/11 participants answered "Yes."

### What information do you need to move forward?
* Design Onboarding — Access to Design Specialization Slack Channel — Read Research Repository Documentation — Understand Group/Team's definition of "Design" (some think it's how it looks, others think its how it works)
* I'm still onboarding so assume that once all the kickoffs have been held I'll know what project/s to begin working on.
* I think the Engineering Onboarding mtg after this one should answer most of my questions. I'm a shared resource right now, so I'm not officially on any Team right now.
* Good question... so much to read, listen to and then assess next steps.
* Since I've worked on this project for the past year+ I think I'm pretty well set.
* I need to set up several Slack channels and reach out to the leads for my team to discuss further steps and to get familiar with it all.

* Don't need any more
* Specific processes for design/research
* Links to GitHub repos, relevant documentation linked from the README
