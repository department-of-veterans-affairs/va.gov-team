### What did we miss? How can we improve?
* I found the presentation very complete
* covered everything I needed.
* 	A breakdown of things that have changed between the old contract and these new contracts. ie, changes in Slack channels or GitHub repos to use for things (va.gov-team vs vets.gov-team)
*  nothing that i can think of
*  I think it was right on point
*  Covered most important topics around on boarding.
*  This is hard to answer, since I've been on the team for a while and now how everything works. I do see value in getting the whole team together and making sure we're on the same page about things, but I didn't learn much myself.
*  Missed: Coordination with Product Managers Not Yet Having On - boarded Front-End Developers 
*  Improve: Team Fillable Spreadsheets in Google Drive For Asyncronys Strategy Facilitation.
*  Expectation setting - I didn't think this was going to be as much of an interview of what we were doing as as it was. I thought it would be more about how to work with the Platform team and how the work you do supports what we do.
*  	I think this was great. Maybe have more interactivity with some new people to git Hub and Pull requests.
*   I thought it was thorough and streamlined - I found it super helpful.
*   I have background knowledge of Zenhub but if I didn't I am not sure I would have understood everything in the tutorial. It was moving a little quickly without a lot of explanation.
*   The Zenhub tour made a lot of sense to me because I've used Zenhub a lot, but I'm curious how it resonated with folks not familiar with Zenhub, GitHub, or general Kanban. It might have been a little fast-paced.
*   Hope you will send out deck after meeting.
*   As we get deeper in the weeds into specific functional areas, would love to see a "day in the life" experience that details what we need to monitor (ex. ZenHub, GitHub and Slack?), steps to take (ex. searching existing Product folders to see what's been done on a related product, style guides, best practices to refer to...) process for doing your part/getting necessary approvals so the next person in the chain can do theirs.
*   nothing
