# Results Summary

## Background
We ran our first onboarding sessions with a new external team. We wanted to understand what's working in the MVP onboarding process and what can be improved.

## Research questions
* After onboarding meetings, do team members know what to do next?
* Do team members feel that onboarding meetings helpful?
* How do team members feel about the content of the onboarding meetings?
* Do team members feel like all of their questions were addressed in the onboarding meetings?
* How confident are new team members about finding answers to questions on their own?

## Method
* Incorporated interviews/discussion into all onboarding kickoffs
* Used OptimalSort to survey team at the end of each onboarding session

### Dates
July 18 - 19, 2019 during Full Team and Engineering onboarding meetings

### Participants
Participants were members of the first onboarding team (By Light).

* 4 developers
* 1 team support 



## Insights & Recommendations

### 1. Missing project requirements/context
The By Light team had not met with their Product Owner/stakeholder before attending the onboarding meetings. We were onboarding the team before they had a clear understand of what they would be working on. Thus, we delayed our Day 2 meeting, which focused on diving deeper into specific project questions.

**Recommendations:** 

* New teams should meet with the product owner/stakeholder before onboarding sessions to understand the project requirements. 
* The Product Support should also attend this meeting to have a shared understanding of the project.


### 2. Issues installing the environment on GFE/Windows
The By Light team uses GFE/Windows and our documentation focuses on installing on Mac machines. 

**Recommendations:** 

* Write documentation for installing the environment on GFE/Windows.
* On intake questionnaire, ask if the team is using GFE if they indicate that they are using Windows

### 5. New members felt that the content of the onboarding was:
* Full team onboarding
   * New (still working out kinks), but well organized and easy to understand
   * Thorough and positive
   * Not sure
   * overwhelming :)
   * a little rushed, but knowing there are other onboading sessions and I am going to have a one-to-one with Bill, I feel good
* Engineering team onboarding
   * Clear and on point for my work.
   * As with the other onboarding - it is high level and a bit rushed, BUT there is plenty of information to go find links, docs to get more detail information
   * Generic
   * Generic; I was expecting it to be more technical at this point.
   * Great walkthrough!

**Recommendations**: 

* Investigate ways to make content less generic. 
* Onboard a few more teams to learn more.
