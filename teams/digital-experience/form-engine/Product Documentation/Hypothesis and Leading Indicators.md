# **Hypothesis and Leading Indicators** 

---

#### **1\. Ease of Access**

**Hypothesis:** If the form builder pre-fills known information and simplifies form layouts, then veterans will spend less time completing forms and experience less frustration.

* **Where to Measure:**  
  * Form completion time through analytics?     
  * Post-interaction survey responses measuring ease of use and user satisfaction with form completion.  
* **How We Learn from Results:**  
  * If completion times significantly decrease and satisfaction scores are high, the streamlined form design is effective.  
  * If completion times do not decrease or veterans report persistent frustration, we will gather qualitative feedback on specific pain points, such as complex form sections or missing pre-filled data, and adjust the UI accordingly.  
* **Leading Indicators to Track Form Builder Success:**   
  * **Form Completion Time Decline**:   
    * An early sign that veterans are benefiting from pre-filled fields and simplified design.  
  * **Increased Satisfaction Scores in Early Surveys:**   
    * Positive initial feedback would indicate that veterans find the forms easier to complete.  
  * **Reduction in Time to First Submission:**   
    * Tracking the average time for veterans’ first submission in the new system can reveal if initial barriers are lowered.  
* **What This Suggests:**   
  * If these indicators trend positively, veterans are experiencing an easier and faster form completion process, meaning the pre-fill and simplification features are effective.

#### **2\. Reducing Redundancy & Errors (PRE-FILL)**

**Hypothesis:** If the form builder pre-fills fields using known data, then VA staff will experience fewer errors and a reduction in time spent re-entering information.

* **Where to Measure:**  
  * Error rates in completed forms and time spent per field (tracked by analytics within the form builder FUTURE).  
  * Feedback on redundant information input from veterans in follow-up surveys.  
* **How We Learn from Results:**  
  * If error rates decline and time per field decreases, it confirms the pre-filling strategy’s effectiveness.  
  * If errors persist or users report continued frustration with redundancy, we’ll investigate the completeness and accuracy of pre-filled fields. We may also add prompts or help guides where redundancies are detected.  
* **Leading Indicators to Track Form Builder Success:**   
  * **Reduction in Error Rates per Form Field**: Lower initial error rates suggest pre-filled data is accurate and reduces manual errors.  
  * **Feedback on Redundant Field Reduction**: If veterans comment on the convenience of not re-entering information, it indicates pre-fill features are reducing redundant entry requirements.  
* **What This Suggests:**   
  * Early decreases in errors and redundancy complaints indicate the form builder is correctly pulling and applying pre-filled data, thereby improving form accuracy and efficiency.

#### **3\. Empowering Veterans and VA Staff**

**Hypothesis:** If the form builder is intuitive and low-code, then Veterans and VA staff will be able to independently create and update forms without relying on technical support.

* **Where to Measure:**  
  * Time logs and analytics on form creation to track time saved by staff / Veterans.  
  * Usage statistics to see how frequently VA staff independently use the form builder.  
  * Staff feedback surveys to assess ease of use and overall satisfaction.  
* **How We Learn from Results:**  
  * If VA staff can effectively create and update forms with minimal time investment, the UI design and low-code features are successful.  
  * If staff continue to need support or report challenges, we’ll identify specific barriers through feedback and potentially redesign complex components to make them more user-friendly.  
* **Leading Indicators to Track Form Builder Success:**   
  * **High Adoption Rate Among Non-Technical Staff**: High usage of the form builder by non-technical users suggests they find it accessible and easy to operate.  
  * **Decrease in Support Requests from VA Staff:** If staff require less technical assistance, this indicates the tool’s usability is strong.  
  * **Reduction in Form Creation and Update Times:** A measurable decrease in time spent creating or updating forms indicates the form builder is efficient for staff use.  
* **What This Suggests:**   
  * If staff are independently using the tool with minimal issues, it’s a strong indicator that the form builder meets their needs for ease and accessibility, supporting self-service goals.  
  *

#### **4\. More Efficient Form Submissions**

**Hypothesis:** If the form builder minimizes manual tasks and supports digital submissions, then form processing times will decrease, leading to faster time to submission. 

* **Where to Measure:**  
  * Time taken from form submission to benefit processing in internal tracking systems.  
  * Staff feedback on the impact of reduced manual tasks and improved workflows.  
* **How We Learn from Results:**  
  * If processing times decrease significantly, the form builder is effectively streamlining the process.  
  * If there is no improvement, we’ll examine specific manual tasks that may still be required and seek to automate these processes further.  
* **Leading Indicators to Track Form Builder Success:**   
  * **Reduction in Manual Processing Steps Tracked by Staff**: If staff report fewer manual steps, it’s a strong indicator that automation and streamlined workflows are effective.  
  * **Faster Submission to Processing Times in Early Uses**: Initial cases where form submissions move quickly to processing are early signs of improved efficiency.  
* **What This Suggests:**   
  * Early efficiency gains in submission and processing times suggest that the form builder is removing bottlenecks and that digital workflows are functioning well.

**5\. Improved Veteran Experience**

**Hypothesis:** If the form builder provides an intuitive, easy-to-use interface, then veterans will report higher satisfaction and be more likely to complete forms without abandonment.

* **Where to Measure:**  
  * Form abandonment rates in form builder analytics.  
  * Veteran feedback surveys focusing on user experience and satisfaction with the form interface.  
* **How We Learn from Results:**  
  * A drop in abandonment rates and positive survey results indicate the form builder's design is effective in enhancing the user experience.  
  * If abandonment rates remain high, we will conduct usability testing sessions with veterans to identify any specific interface elements or steps that may be causing frustration or confusion.  
* **Leading Indicators to Track Form Builder Success:**   
  * **Positive Ratings on User Experience**: Early positive ratings from veterans about the form’s usability would indicate a smoother experience.  
  * **Feedback Highlighting Simplified Interaction**: If veterans comment on the simplicity of the forms, it suggests the UI/UX design meets user expectations.  
* **What This Suggests:**   
  * If veterans complete forms without frustration, it points to a successful design in terms of ease and accessibility, enhancing overall user experience.  
* **Experiment**:   
* Set up a feedback collection tool and analyze comments to identify frequent friction points or areas for improvement.  
*

#### **6\. Impact on Veterans’ Lives**

**Hypothesis:** If the form builder reduces the administrative burden and simplifies access to benefits, then veterans will experience less stress and have a more positive perception of VA services.

* **Where to Measure:**  
  * Overall veteran satisfaction with VA services measured in periodic feedback surveys.  
* **How We Learn from Results:**  
  * If satisfaction ratings and processing times improve, it confirms that the form builder is positively impacting veterans’ experiences.  
  * If results are mixed, we will analyze survey responses to identify areas for improvement, such as increasing support resources, enhancing interface accessibility, or refining submission workflows.  
* **Leading Indicators to Track Form Builder Success:**   
  * **Initial Satisfaction Ratings Post-Launch**: Positive feedback from early users indicates that the form builder is already providing a meaningful, low-friction experience.  
  * **Veteran Feedback on Reduced Stress or Administrative Hurdles**: Comments noting decreased stress or easier access to benefits can signal the form builder is positively affecting veterans’ experiences.  
* **What This Suggests:**   
  * **Initial Satisfaction Ratings Post-Launch**: Positive feedback from early users indicates that the form builder is already providing a meaningful, low-friction experience.
