# Incorporating VADS styling into Drupal

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Form Builder designs call for VADS-like look and feel. VADS web components and styles are not currently available in Drupal. We need to figure out how we can best accommodate this presentation.

## Decision

In short, copy styles (perhaps via tokens).

For now, more can be read here: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/96592#issuecomment-2485779599

## Consequences

In short, this could decouple us from VADS updates.
