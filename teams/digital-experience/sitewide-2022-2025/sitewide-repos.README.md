## Sitewide Repositories
Our team contributes to building the Drupal CMS, many portions of the unauthenticated VA.gov experience, and we own several small APIs that power some of our products. We do not own any Devops or CI/CD infrastructure for builds, deployments, or running automated tests, but partner with VA Platform teams who own and support the infrastructure we rely on.

## Tech stack
Our technical stack spans several different repositories. Each repository includes READMEs to help explain its nuances. 
- [vets-api](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api) is a Ruby on Rails API layer. Any integrations with systems outside of VA.gov route through vets-api, with the exception of CMS data migrations.
- [va.gov-cms](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms) powers the Drupal CMS, including data migrations from other systems. This repo is also where our teamâ€™s ticketing and sprint boards live.
- [content-build](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/content-build) is the templating layer of the front-end, and uses Node.js, Metalsmith, and liquid.js templates.
- [next-build](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/next-build/tree/main) is a newer templating layer of the front-end built in NextJS, that will eventually replace content-build. We are slowly migrating templates from content-build to next-build.
- [vets-websit](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website)e houses frontend Node.js / React apps. Many teams in the VA ecosystem code exclusively in vets-website and vets-api.
- [vsp-platform-revproxy](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vsp-platform-revproxy) Primarily owned by Platform team. Our main contribution to this repo is adding content redirects to [redirects.yml](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vsp-platform-revproxy/blob/main/template-rendering/revproxy-vagov/vars/redirects.yml)
