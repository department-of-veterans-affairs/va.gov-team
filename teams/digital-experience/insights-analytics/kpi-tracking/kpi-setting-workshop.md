**Housekeeping Readout:**
- We’d love for everyone to be present in the meeting with cameras on
- We understand that this is probably something that you’re not used to doing and that there are going to be parts of the conversation that you might not have dialogue for. We’re still looking for everyone to participate. We’ve found that the more successful workshops have been with full-team involvement, and is more helpful for you all to be able to link your work back to your team’s outcomes and impacts and measuring that.
- Nedie and I will be moderating the workshop. We’ll weigh in where we might see anything that may be helpful but are looking for your team to drive the discussions.
