- How is remote work going for VEO and WHVAH
  - _A few challenges in the beginning but have since leveled out._
  - Call volume
    - _Call volume has stabalized.  Mission Act calls decreased about 37% from March to April, but as of late, they are beginning to trend upward._
- Progress on SalesForce Fields for VA.gov issues
  - _Due to other priorities, the SalesForce development is now on hold.  Lana Waters expressed that she is unsure how long the delay will be, but she is going to try to push forward with the updates.  She will keep us posted on any updates and the outcome._
- Review of ALL current VA.gov technical KMs

    - Any additional Vetexts coming out?
      - _Chante informaed that a Vetext was due to be sent out on 5/22/2020, but that did not occur at the last minute._
    - Call center modernization: Have there been any issues with chatbot and if so, whom do users contact?
      - _Chante has advised that there have been no reported issues for chatbot and that if there were an issue, then the user would probably call in to the call center and have their question answered.  She will provide them with the demo video for the chatbot, but there should be no need for troubleshooting, but if so, to notify us so that we can assist accordingly._
    - Discussion regarding routing to tier 2 and tier 3 in the future.  What does that look like?  What would we (VSP Contact Center Team) want that routing process to look like?
      - _Chante and I will meet to discuss what we would want that routing to look like. Brainstorm for the phased roll out._

#### 5/27/2020:
#### WHVAH/VEO _(Tiger Team)_<> VA.gov Contact Center

    -_Informed that this was a meeting that was held before my onboarding, but instead of cutting from the schedule, maybe it could be montly._ 
  - _TDB_
- Can the VA.gov Contact Center team create templates, desk references, or FAQs to provided to the agents in order to obtain additional details while on the phone with the user?
  - _Todd and Eric agreed that we can create KMs that will be entered into SF for the agents to use._
  - _There is no particular format for the KMs._
  - _Requested to add Doian Adeyemi and Mike Scipione to the meetingn since they manage KMs._
- I inquired if the agents would be able to obtain email addresses while on the phone with users.  I advised that in review of the SF tickets I notice that many times agents will receive a phone number from the user in order to receive a call back.  I informed them that I do not have a business phone and it is implausible for one person to manage that task.  Also, much of the information that we need to pass back to the appropriate team is easier to retrieve in writing.
  - _They stated that a KM could be creratd to ensure that agents request email addresses from the user._
      -_Instead of creating on KM for asking for an email address, I am going to add verbiage into each KM that I create to ask for an email address from the user._
- Todd inquired about possible chatbot issues.
  - _Chante advised of the same information that she previously provided to the larger team.  Todd was not on that call.  Information from above notes were stated again._
- WHVAH/VEO team gave kudos to Chante for the Community Care change that occurred.  They stated that Chante really came through with the information that they needed.
- Todd and Eric stated that advanced notice for any updates, bugs, launches, fixes, scheduled maintenance, etc. Be given as much notice as possible really makes a difference in their operations.  
- They inquired if the user guides for Mission Act, locator specifically, have been updated.  The guide contacins links that are no longer valid.
  - _Chante will review and update if needed and resend._
- I asked if agents were permitted to enter phone numbers in the actual case notes in SF.  This area of SF populates when reports are runa nd exported in to an Excel spreadsheet.  I was unsure if possible PII should be entered in this area of the system.
  - _They advised that there is no issue with entering contact information in this area.  As long as it is not an SSN, then it is not an issue._
