# Outstanding Tier Three Issues	Process

Currently there are multiple outstanding tier 3 issues in ZenHub.  Anoutstanding issue is any issue that has not been addressed within 30 days.  The majority of the issues lies with the Benefits and Memorials team.  The process below has been agreed upon by both Contact Center Leads and the BAM1 Product Manager.

A follow up email template has been created in order to send to all users that were experiencing an upload issue with claims or their claim status.  The email will be sent from a shared email address that is currently being created by the Enterprise VA IT team.  That email address will be: OITCOtechsupport@va.gov.

Once the email has been sent to the end user, the issue details will be entered into the shared Excel spreadsheet, Tier 3 Outstanding Issues.  Issue details are as follows:
-	Owner
-	System
-	Escalation Date
-	Inquiry Number
-	Topic
-	Sub-Topic
-	ZenHub Ticket Number
-	User initials
-	Details (this is the information that the user provided to us)
When the user has responded and provided all of the details requested in the follow up email, a shadowing engagement confirmation email will be sent to the user, this time, including the BAM1 Product Manager and any additional individuals of his choosing (currently this is Luke and Andrea).

Once the issue is resolved the team will advise so that that the spreadsheet can updated accordingly.  If the issue is not resolved, then the issue will remain open on the spreadsheet.
