Legacy information. DOMO is widely used now. Not duplicated in Confluence.

## Reporting Visualization

Currently the Contact Center Monthly Report lives in DOMO and mirrors an Excel spreadsheet.  The purpose of this is to have the Contact Center Monthly 
Report be cohesive with the other IA dashboards that have been created.

One item to consider is we may not be able to get the DOMO tables in exactly the same format/visualization in which have been 
delivered in Excel simply due to DOMO visualization limitations.  

Visualization for the report have been put on hold until we receive feedback from teams regarding the report and a better decision can be 
implemented.
