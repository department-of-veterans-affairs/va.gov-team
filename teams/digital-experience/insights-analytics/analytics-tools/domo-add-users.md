## Process for Adding Users to Domo

In order to more easily audit user access in Domo, we are adopting the usage of 'teams.' Each team will have specific dashboards that they will have access to. 

1. Add users via the "People" tab on the Admin Settings. 

Most team members should receive "Participant" access rights, unless additional access is requested, which will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

2. Once the user is added, add the user to the appropriate group on the "Groups" tab of the Admin settings. 

Their group should correspond to the team they work under. If a corresponding group does not exist, contact the Insights product manager for additional information.
