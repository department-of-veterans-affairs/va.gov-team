# Github Documentation Structure for the VSP Analytics & Insights Team

**Audience**: VSP Analytics & Insights

**Overview**: *How might we* ensure consistency and readability of our documentation on Github? This document outlines how to structure documentation in Github for the VSP Analytics & Insights team.

## Structure

1. Ensure that we adhere to the [VSP Content & IA naming and structure protocol](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/orientation/repo-guidelines.md) on Github
2. Anything VFS facing needs to go in the Platforms folder
3. Anything VSP-internal should go in the Teams folder
4. Product Outlines & User Guides should go in the Products folder
5. Ensure that documentation is easy to read (Has headers, etc.)

Ensure that:
1. The title is bolded
2. The documentation audience is clear
3. There's a summary or overview
4. The documentation is readable: reach out to another Insights team member to QA!
