# White House Visit Synthesis

*Dates:* July 16-18  
*Location:* Shepherdstown, West Virginia  
*Visitors:* Alex Pappas, Chante Lantos-Swett, Mina Farzad

## Overview of the White House Hotline

"The White House / VA Hotline (1-855-948-2311) provides our nation’s Veterans with a direct, dedicated contact line that allows them to interact with highly trained, live agents to answer their needs and concerns 24-hours a day, 365-days a year. The White House / VA Hotline is VA’s first non-clinical, non-emergency around-the-clock hotline. It is also the only VA contact center that provides enterprise-wide complaint, compliment and recommendation intake. It is staffed by mostly Veterans or Veteran family-member agents. The hotline is part of VA’s contact center modernization efforts of re-aligning VA internal processes to ensure a consistent, positive Veteran experience."

## The Problem

Since the launch of the new VA.gov, there has not been an identified contact center that is responsible for handling VA.gov user issues due to HRC’s decision to not transition support from Vets.gov to VA.gov.  Because of this, there are several VA.gov specific issues (i.e. signing in, navigation, VA.gov technical issues, etc.) that are not handled or tracked by any contact center. This has caused significant problems for the VA.gov team and its users.
1.	Users are unable to get help for simple issues when they contact a contact center. Users are being transferred from one contact center to another and are unable to find the answers to issues or report a technical problem.
2.	 The VA.gov team(s) are not able to get consistent tracking or feedback on user issues. This has made it nearly impossible to resolve technical issues and inform product development and prioritization. 
To meet the gaps in the current situation, VEO identified the White House Hotline (WHH) as the contact center to be trained on VA.gov issues and collaborate with the DSVA and VA.gov teams to create a system for reporting and tracking.  

## Goals of the Trip
1.	Provide training on VA.gov to all agents at the WHH.  We trained 60 agents and supervisors in 12 training sessions.  
2.	Learn more about the operations of the contact center. Mina and Alex participated in "doubl jacking" sessions (listening in on live calls) and were briefed on the CRM and its functionality.  
3.	Observe and record feedback to improve future training and collaboration with the White House Hotline. We used our training sessions as an opportunity to ask questions about VA.gov and the Veteran and agent experience, to uncover any interesting themes or issues.   

## Major Findings and Next Steps
1.	**WHH agents and supervisors are generally not familiar with VA.gov and its offerings.** While we did not poll ahead of the training, we found that many WHH agents, if not the majority, are not very familiar with VA.gov and therefore rarely help users with a VA.gov issue. Unsurprisingly, WHH agents who were also veterans, had the most understanding of VA.gov. Otherwise, an agent’s knowledge on VA.gov was completely dependent on their own desire to learn more about it. This is difficult for non-veteran agents because they can’t easily see what an identity verified, veteran account looks like. We learned that some agents had to find a veteran agent, and have them sign into their VA.gov account to replicate the screen a user was on and provide assistance. 

    * Continue providing training and materials to the WHH so they continue to learn and become more comfortable using VA.gov. Additionally, we know know agents will be joining at regular intervals. The materials that we should create should tie together and act as a comprehensive curriculum that an agent can learn from as part of their initial 3-4 weeks of onboarding training. 

    * Provide access to test accounts so WHH agents can spend time using the site and be able to help direct a user if they are encountering or issue or having trouble navigating.

2.	**The WHH CRM is robust but certain WHH policies conflict with agents' ability to provide VA.gov Tier 1 support.**  The WHH uses Salesforce as its CRM and our observation was that Salesforce has been configured successfully and agents have been trained to use it well. Agents tag each case with appropriate fields and are adept at documenting a case with extensive and detailed notes. Additionally, Salesforce allowed the agents to share reference numbers with other contact centers during a call transfer, allowing the new agent to see relevant information as they prepared to take a new call.   
However, the WHH was created to handle escalated cases and complaints. Because of this, the WHH prioritizes hiring agents with strong communication skills and empathy. Most agents do not have any experience in handling technical issues, and many of them are not comfortable with using digital tools. Additionally, the WHH does not use scripts to allow agent to converse with a user in a natural way. This makes sense but might not be the best policy when dealing with known, recurring issues. Moving forward, we will have to work with the WHH to determine how to balance the different tasks the contact center is responsible for and empower agents with skills and information that will help them. 

    * We need to provide a more focused training on how to troubleshoot technical issues and how to identify issues that should be escalated to the triage team. This could be formatted as a skills based training for agents looking for professional development opportunities and not just as a new task that they have to learn. 
    * Work with the WHH Operations team to see if we can find ways to integrate scripted language to help agents feel more comfortable answering known, recurring VA.gov issues while not compromising the empathetic and unscripted culture of the WHH.
    
3.	**It could be a while before we can get WHH analytics that track VA.gov issues in a meaningful way.** The WHH currently uses Salesforce as its CRM. The plan was to transition over to MS Dynamics this summer but this plan has been put on hold due to the prioritization of Mission Act support. This is problematic because currently, all development on Salesforce has been paused which means changes to fields can’t take place until this pause has been lifted. 

    * We have identified a work-around given these constraints, that utilizes pre-existing fields and manually entered phrases. This is less than ideal from a data and agent experience perspective. While we can try and make this work in the very short-term, the goal will be to push the WHH to decide either way (transition to MS Dynamics or resume work on Salesforce) as quickly as possible.
    * Given the difficulty of tracking VA.gov issues, we want to try and improve feedback to the VA.gov teams by setting up a consistent listening session. This will allow VA.gov team members to listen to live or pre-recorded calls related to VA.gov and gain insights into the user and agent experience. 
    
4.	**We have found a process for WHH agents to escalate issues to the triage team but require more discussions around process before implementing** We were able to confirm with the WHH team that we can add members of the triage team to Salesforce. This will allow the WHH to assign Tier 2/3 cases to these team members. While the technical process is simple, we need to confirm with the WHH operations team how to handle these escalated cases from a people process perspective. If we rely on agents to solely determine whether a case is Tier 2 or 3, we run the risk of inundating the triage team with many more cases than they can handle. 
    * Identify members of the triage team to add to WHH instance of Salesforce and set up with correct permissions. 
    * Review team structure and hierarchy to determine how supervisors might be able to provide quality control over escalated issues identified by agents. 
    
5.	**Other contact centers do not seem to know about the WHH even though many of them transfer VA.gov issues to MyVA311.** In general, we were very surprised by how little agents in other contact centers knew about the WHH. During our "double jacking" sessions, agents in other contact centers would express confusion when they were told a call was being transferred to them by the WHH. Very few knew what the WHH was even though we know many agents in other contact centers direct people to MyVA311 when calling in about a VA.gov issue. We believe there is an opportunity to do outreach to contact centers and provide more clarity on the WHH and its role. This will also allow us to communicate around VA.gov and set the messaging around what a VA.gov issue is and when it is appropriate to transfer to the WHH. 
    * We are already coordinating with program managers of other contact centers on a weekly basis. We are going to bring up this observation with them and begin discussions on what outreach or training we can do with other contact centers to ensure they know the purpose of the WHH and which VA.gov issues they handle. 

## Feedback and Questions from WHH Team
We received a great deal of anecdotal and qualitative information and feedback from the WHH agents as we held trainings. Below we've written out the top feedback we received directly from agents and their supervisors. 

* **Facility Locator:** In nearly every training session, multiple agents would complain about the facility locator on VA.gov. Many agents complained that this tool was not helpful to them and in fact, most agents said they used the “interactive” VISN map to help a veteran find the nearest VA Medical Center (https://www.va.gov/directory/guide/map.asp?dnum=1). They did say that the facility locator was useful for community care but even still, they complained a great deal that the information was not complete. From a UI perspective, agents seemed to dislike how the information is displayed. The inability to see a full list was bothersome to them. 
* **DD214:** Agents often asked whether VA.gov provided an easier way for a veteran to request their DD214. They said this was a question that came up constantly and were eager for there to be a better and easier way for a veteran to request and receive their DD214.
* **ID.me Feedback:**
    * Agents expressed a great deal of frustration and distrust with ID.me. They said users who they spoke to often complained about receiving spam from ID.me or were annoyed that they were being forced to upgrade their account with ID.me. We were able to confirm that ID.me does not present the option for signing up for marketing offers during the VA.gov account creation process. It seems some users are still accidentally getting them, perhaps if they sign into their ID.me wallet. 
    * Agents were also frustrated that ID.me didn’t have a posted response time for the helpdesk and that a phone number was provided but did not seem to be the fastest way to get support. We have reached out to ID.me to learn more about their plans for customer support, and get a more concrete estimate for response time. 
* **VA.gov Search Bar:** Agents complained about the search bar and that its search results were not helpful. This is especially problematic because the agents have been instructed to not use google when searching for answers. Agents demonstrated a number of scenarios where they’ve tried to use the search bar to find something very specific and the search bar results were way off. 

## Lessons Learned from Training and Visit 
In general, we felt like the training and visit went well. Using feedback from agents and from a retro we conducted, we have a few lessons learned and takeaways that we will keep in mind for our next visit and training:  
1. Push harder to have a training room where agents can be on computers. Having a more hands on, interactive training would be much more interesting for the agents and a better learning environment, given the more technical nature of VA.gov issues.  
2. See if we can have training groups created base on level of comfort with and knowledge of digital and technical tools. There were clearly some people who found the training boring because of it's simplicity. There were others who found the information overwhelming and confusing. It would be great to deliver trainings that are catered to groups based on their knowledge or experience with digital tools.  
3. Push for more structured agenda that goes beyond trainings. Most of the WHH operations team is remote from West Virginia and therefore did not have much say in how our time would be spent while there. Now that we know who the onsite coordinator is, we can make sure they are in the loop early on and ensure that the right meetings and activities are set up to help achieve our goals for the visit.  
4. Snacks! Many of the agents wish there had been snacks during the training. We can see if it's possible to provide that so they have something to look forward to during the session.
