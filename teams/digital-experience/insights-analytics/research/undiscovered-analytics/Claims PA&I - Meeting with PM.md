## Meeting with Claims PM - 6/27/19

**3 Data Streams**
- PA&I Data: Outcomes Stream
- Error Reporting from Internal Sources
- Google Analytics

_Information Funnel for PA&I Data:_ Speak to Claims Product Owner
  - Data aggregation is very manual and high effort for the contacted group
  - Continuous biweekly emails from the Claims product team. Individually maintained by the Product Owner.
  
**Received Data**
- Form: 2 pages of charts in PDF
- Data:
  - Paper submissions by month
  - Claims Cycle by Source (Avg. Days in Cycle)
  - Pending Claims by Month
  - Avg. Days to Complete
  - Completed Claims
  - Development Items Requested for completed claims
  
**Data Aggregation**

_Difficulties_
  - Data is not a 1:1 comparison to internal metrics
  - To read the data, should understand that all the use cases of paper and eBenefits are not currently supported by va.gov
  - Would be more helpful in product decision making to have this data in the beginning of builds
  
_Helpful_
  - Data supports hypotheses from beginning of Claims build
      - Data supports that the personalized form process helps cut down on claims cycle time
  - Data supports assumption that supports the assumption that va.gov saves VA money and improves the Veteran experience (shoretened cycle time)
  - Data supports product decision to continue building to support more use cases on the Claims app


## Meeting with Claims PM - 7/3/19
_How PM was able to get Claims data_
 - Consistent communication with data owners
 - Create tag/ attribute for data needed. Get data tagged properly to receive consistent data each time it is pulled
 - Have an internal key stakeholder with a great understanding of the data
 - Data request process perspective
    - Will most likely need some some sort of data sharing agreement
    - Keep in mind that the process to request date + access to databases may take a while
    - Work with someone within the specific department to request data - someone with actual (i.e. VBA) tagline in their email
    - Sometimes data extracts that are supposed to be recurring only end up getting sent once (be sure to follow up)
    
_Claims Data_
 - [https://paicustomerportal.vba.va.gov] (note: links are on the VA network, and cannot be accessed in Chrome)
 - Coprorate Database Utilities: [http://vbacoda.vba.va.gov/plsql/desc_util.startup]
 - Now everyone who works in these DBs are using tech jargon (I.e. Chapter 103, vs. 190)
 - Reports: [https://vbaw.vba.va.gov/PAI/ReportsList.asp] (shouldnâ€™t need access to Tableau to tap into this)
