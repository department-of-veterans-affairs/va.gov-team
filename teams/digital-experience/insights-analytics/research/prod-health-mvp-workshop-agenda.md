# June 2019 Insights & Analytics MVP Workshop Agenda

## Epic reminder

As a VA Product Owner, I need to easily understand how the tools I own are performing so I can make informed product decisions based on data.

## Meeting agenda

- List possible features / user stories (doc for this coming soon)
- Vote on how each feature / user story measures up against two pieces of criteria:
  - Value: does it solve a known + critical pain point?
  - Risk: can the user still achieve their main goal(s) without it?
- Per ^ agree on critical features / user stories
- Draft hypotheses
- Update ZenHub epic + stories w/resulting tasks for this sprint (and beyond)
