# Rules of Engagement - Analytics Implementation & QA

**Goal:** Workshop what we want the implementation and QA to look like as teams onboard and what we want it look like in a few months.

**VSP Goals:** 
1) ensure VFS teams have their data tracked 
2) provide robust data reporting 
3) be able to scale

## Current Process
1. Discovery/VSP Orientation - Insights
2. FE Implementation - Engineering

    _Most common elements in static content and forms libraries_
3. Tagging Implementation - Insights
4. QA - Insights

### VSP Orientation Discussion
Identify team members who will be engineering points of contacts

### Post Orientation Discussion
- Nedie and Jon - reach out and schedule implementation orientation
- Identify who, if any, POCs will need edit access on GTM and GA.

    1. Run through ROE for pain points & determine where else can be automated
            - Teams should be able to identify funnels, additional dimensions (outside of the common ones), provide information for helping name goals/naming conventions

    1. Will need to be reviewed/organized
    1. Will need to be published on Github
    1. Will need to be communicated
