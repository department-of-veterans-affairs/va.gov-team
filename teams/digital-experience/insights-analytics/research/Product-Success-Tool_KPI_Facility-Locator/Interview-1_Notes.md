## Notes:

---

- "Haven't had a heck of a lot of time to think about everything"
- Facilitator sets up context for meeting
    - P1 approves recording
- How often would you ideally look at data for KPIs?
    - "I'd like to match the KPIs on a sprint-by-sprint basis to make sure that we are adjusting appropriately"
    - Every two weeks
- Would you be switching KPIs or assessing ?
    - "Both. More of a concentration on how we are measuring up to our existing KPIs"
    - Also "what of our current releases have impact on those KPIs. Are they measuring the right things?
        - e.g. after seeing dashboard "We've made some changes where we'd want to make some notes along those lines where we made this change and deprecated or included or repositioned this label"
- Would you want to do that annotation right on the chart?
    - "I would do it right on the chart, yes"
- Where would you look for data for KPIs befor ethis dashboard
    - "number 1 I'd ask you guys 'I'm loooking for XYZ"
    - "I'd also go into Google Analytics and explore there"
    - "Also do a request for 4C, along those lines"
- What's your role at the VA?
    - Product owner for "all things facilities"
    - focused on Facility Locator up to this point
    - Recently took over VAMC product
        - including the implementation of the additional VAMCs into the product, as well as it's growth and changes
- Would be interesting to hear about your background at VAMC as well
    - "Once we get [quarterly planning done] and we understand what the KPIs were for that product, we can integrate that"
- What do KPIs help you do as a PO?
    - "They help me validate the hypothesis"
    - "They're benchmarks on which we are able to use data, even if it's sentiment-driven data to measure how we are doing against our hypotheses."
    - "having a quantitative and occasionally qualitative analysis to refer back to helps me to shape the product and communicate back to stakeholders the justification for why or why we are not doing certain things"
    - "being able to establish these benchmarks...with consensus from the whole product team, and also having input from the whole business allows  us to get and keep everyone on the same page."
- Could you pull up the KPI dashboard and share your screen?
    - (Facilitator sends link)
    - "I don't even know if I've logged into this yet to be honest with you"
    - (Access struggles on Domo)
- Could you go through the dashboard and talk through your thought process?
    - "I remember from our originally planning session for KPIs...where we were establishing what our KPIs were for the first quarter of work...we came up with some KPIs that we could map back to [our team's] objectives"
    - KPI #1 was to track a "bunch of issues we had inherited....and how we address those in a timely fashion"
        - helpful to have link in place to GitHub issues
    - "I expect a list of items that are 'done' and 'not done'"
        - that can be seen in their Zenhub epic
    - KPI #2 seeing how quickly searches are returned by facility type is "really important to us"
        - "I'm a little bit confused by having an 'unknown' [category] in there"
        - Thinks 'Urgent Care Pharmacies' categories might be mapped incorrectly
            - indicates a possible problem with the data
        - "being able to say the 13.68 seconds for a return is not all that great"
- How would you dig further into that information (KPI #2)
    - Talk with engineers to go through why some of the observed issues may be taking place.
        - Perhaps API issues, etc.
        - Knows just enough to ask the right questions?
- How would you share this information with the engineers?
    - "I would very much share this with them"
    - Would work with the PM to go through the data with the team to investigate further
    - "Most importantly, when we go through our quarterly planning  we would all be looking through this...that's when the deep-dive happens?
- Would you want them to have access to this dashbaord?
    - "There's more than one answer to that question"
    - "I would go with giving them accounts"
        - "What's the value add for them having an account vs a screenshare?"
        - "Don't see our developer delving in here to take a look at this. They'd be looking at raw logs"
        - No concern with granting access, but may not be used.
- KPI #3 Graph gives idea for repeated searches
- Do you have a target for that?
    - "Yes...I liked the fact that there was this line here" (lines indicate low, high, mean)
        - "I misinterpreted this line that it was our goal, and not the low bandwidth"
- Having a goal, and having that marked in the graph would be helpful
    - "Yeah...would be really really helpful"
    - Confused on what the '+' and '-' buttons are on bottom right of vis
- Interested in seeing the comparison of their KPI performance vs other apps on the site
    - Evaluate whether changes are due to the team or overall trends in the site
- Would you reword your KPIs to integrate cross-team perspective to evaluate some of these things?
    - "yes"
    - "Next quarter we want to map back to how we were doing, and also have a point of comparison for how we were doing for the rest of the site"
    - 18F compares across sites and different divisions, that would be helpful here as well
- Is there anything that's unclear overall?
    - "i'm very curious about what these buttons are for" (+ - buttons in bottom right)
    - "I'm very worried I'm going to affect or change what you've done and break it"
    - Wants to "Change some of the timelines to drill down. This isn't very intuitive to me to do all of that"
        - "Do some of that more granular period of time changes"
- Would you be interested in doing some training with us to level up that skillset?
    - "Yes, as bandwidth allows, most definitely"
- How much more production in Domo would you do? Play with what we've created, or be able to create your own cards and alter charts?
    - "I'd want the training wheels first"
- Do you have any other questions
    - "I do not, no"
