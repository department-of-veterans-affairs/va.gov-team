## Notes:

- Consents to recording
- Can you tell me about your role at the VA
    - One of the product leads focused on Benefits & Memorials tools & services
        - Working a lot in the education space & ad hoc benefits related work
- Does your team use KPIs
    - "Yeah, any and every time we're able to find reasonable ones"
- Do you set KPIs for each product?
    - "Yeah. Typically I've gotten in the habit of trying to set them on a project-by-project basis in the up-front portion of discovery as soon as I have enough information to brainstorm on what meaningful metrics might be"
        - "Refine them as we learn if needed"
- How often would you look at those KPIs?
    - "I try to fairly frequently by setting them up in the ReadMe or Product Outline"
    - Checks more frequently as they begin moving toward a launch
    - "Maybe not daily, but multiple times per week"
- How do you find data for those KPIs?
    - "All over the place, it just depends"
    - "Useful stuff in Google Analytics to start from"
    - Sometimes "The more meaningful metrics lie with the business line"
        - e.g. how does a website action translate into approved benefits claims
        - ^ can't be found directly from web analytics
    - Also uses the "eBenefits analytics package"
- Do KPIs correlate to product success?
    - "Yeah, that's the idea. It's definitely the objective"
    - Sometimes it hasn't panned out as desired
- Screensharing Domo dashboard
- Please look through the dashboard and vocalize your reactions to some of these things
    - "I'm seeing a listing of various objectives"
    - "KPIs organized into objectives. I'll assume they're intended to be set by the team in question"
    - KPI 1
        - Notices start date of metric being tracked
        - Confusion around subtext. Unique to this KPI
    - KPI 2
        - Subtext: "Not sure if that's additional context or an update"
- Would seeing your team's KPIs with visualizations of data related to them be helpful to your team?
    - "Yes, of course"
    - "It's always useful to see stuff and how it changes over time"
- If this was put together for your team, who would you want to share that information with?
    - "Most readily to mind are the education stakeholders"
        - They have their own contract, "it's always super useful to give them hard data, because typically their executive leadership team doesn't include that in their decision making process"
        - "Would be really useful for empowering them to give their executive leadership team important feedback"
- How would you want to give them that information? Give them access? Give them PDFs? PPTs? Screenshots?
    - "With this group of people I'd probably do a little bit of both, but rely on giving them access. This group is a pretty hands-on group"
        - "If there were particularly interesting or useful findings I come across" I'd take a screenshot.
- Would a KPI dashboard be more useful than the education tool we provided your team in the past
    - Not more useful, necessarily, but addresses different needs
    - "They're very distinct and different"
    - "As they exist now, this one is more interesting to me personally"
- Would you want both views of information?
    - "Yeah. This one is more of information i care about"
    - "I don't need the [other] tool to tell me the website is down"
    - "For the most valuable information the other tool offers, the tool is not the easiest place to get that information"
- Are there other metrics you'd want to add to this beyond KPIs?
    - "Nothing immediately comes to mind"
- Do you have any questions for me?
    - "No, I like this tool"
    - "Do you have any desire or plan to...try to come up with a way to quantify product success for [any product] as a rollup?"
        - Facilitator: We tested that, but it was unpopular.
    - "Is the facility locator the only content area that exists at this point?"
        - Facilitator: Yes, so far
- "Will the other tool go away?"
    - Facilitator: Still TBD
- Would you have desire to get more into Domo and build your own dashboards?
    - "I don't know, that's a good question I should have asked"
    - "Maybe"
    - "I don't really care about doing it...I'd like the ability to come back to it and add new KPIs, or modify them"
        - Is willing to do some work themselves, but would like a collaborative process to kick it off with the Analytics team
