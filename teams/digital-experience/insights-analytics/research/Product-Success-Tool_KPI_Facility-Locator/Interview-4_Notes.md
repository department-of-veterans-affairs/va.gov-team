## Notes:

- Participant comfortable recording
- Participant screenshares Domo
- Product management for eBenefits
- "Mandate is to get as much features and functionality out of eBenefits and into VA.gov"
    - Refactoring eBenefits code
- Do you use KPIs on your team?
    - "Yeah"
- How often do you look at your KPIs?
    - "It depends on what point in the lifecycle we're in."
    - "Toward the end we'll look a little harder at what they're doing"
    - Has a rough idea of what success metrics are at the start of the project, but that often evolves
- So you set them for each project?
    - "Each feature, yes"
- How big or long is a feature?
    - "They can range anywhere from a simple view task..."
        - e.g. viewing payment history
    - "But then it ranges all the way up to a massive, complicated, multi-use form like the 686"
        - e.g. attaching dependents to disability awards
- So you're setting KPIs for each of those?
    - "Right"
    - "For rate of disabilities for example, the KPIs were—we're not really sure...one of the KPIs is to see the traffic move from one side of the site to the other"
        - "Transitional KPI for traffic" moving from eBenefits to VA.gov
    - (for other feature) conversation rate for finishing forms, time from start to finish, "provide milestones in the form itself to increase the conversation rate in the automated part of the for submission in RBPS" (rule based processing system)
    - Trying to evaluate time & dollar cost for manual processes
- Where do you currently go to get the data for the KPIs and how do you track them?
    - "Getting a lot of that information is tough. Usually we'll just go to the stakeholder and ask them for historical information for what they can recall"
    - "I don't have a way to just login and look at the way those systems are operating"
    - "Hopefully, something like this will help."
- If you had a system, how often would you want to login and look at that information
    - "Monday is usually my day to look at numbers for different things" e.g. Google Analytics
    - "If it's a dashboard that's giving me accurate information that's responsive, I'll probably look at it way more than that. But at least one a week"
- If you could talk your way through what you're seeing and how you're interpreting it in Domo.
    - "So, I guess for starters, um, the first objective we see here, that makes sense, we want to know the number of usability and accessibility defects, we want to improve the quality of the pages that are going out"
    - "KPI 2...this is a pretty standard performance one that we would see. How long does it take to return search results and are they accurate"
        - Hovers over each type to highlight the plot on the graph. Displayed "I guess in seconds"
        - "There's probably a lot of ways to do this, but I'd want to zero in on a day here [to investigate high numbers]"
        - "IDK if there's a way you can get a moving average" "Is there a trend line that can be added?"
        - Clicks wrench menu in top-right
            - Export is "pretty cool"
            - "Adding to favorites, that's probably a pretty good idea"
            - "Notifications—that'd be cool if I could set parameters [for when to get push notifications based on a threshold]"
            - "Anytime something prompts me to take action sooner rather than later, I'll probably want to sign up for it?
    - KPI 3...
        - "What's a search refinement?"
            - understood upon explanation
        - "And there's a rate for that? So it's like a conversion?"
        - "Well, based on the KPI and looking at the graph, I can see that we need to do something (chuckles)"
        - "The way Domo seems to be presenting the information is great"
            - "It doesn't fuss around with the axes really. You can clearly see the dates. The style of what these are is kind of a spread by design"
        - "This has that Avg, Min, Max in here which I really like"
- Would you want to see your teams KPIs presented like this?
    - "Yes, 100%"
    - "Google Analytics does a great job, I'd be interested to learn more if Domo can look further into what the form system does." (talks about specific needs for form system KPIs)
    - "Does this take anything other than Google Analytics?"
        - Yes — "okay, great, yeah, um, so seeing that kind of stuff would be super handy"
    - "If I had a way to collect & view Sentry data a little bit easier...I need something that's a little bit easier to digest [than looking at Sentry directly]"
- If you meet your KPIs does that mean your product is successful?
    - "It should, yeah"
    - "If we can at least just move it, it's already really successful. But if we can transform it into something better, [then our KPIs should illustrate that]"
- Is there anything outside of your KPIs that you'd want to see to measure product success?
    - "I'm not sure"
    - Would be good to see user satisfaction over time
    - "Over time is the usability better—that's hard to measure with just a KPI"
- Do you have any questions for me?
    - "No really, I guess for the scope of this call not really"
    - "How can I get started? What questions do I need to start asking re: form conversion services?"
        - Facilitator shares state of project. Suggests reaching out to Analytics product manager.
- How would you want to share KPI data from a dashboard?
    - "First and foremost would be sharing with the team. They do appreciate the fact that they can see the impact of the work they are doing"
    - "I'd want to share that as regularly as possible, or even give them their own access..."
        - Or just sharing screenshots
    - Hopefully spot and resolve trends before they become major issues
    - "As far as larger audiences, I think there's probably a good argument for taking the information out of here and putting it into a slide deck [to provide more story and context]."
