*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Amy and I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the Product Success Tool for the Facility Locator KPIs. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the tool to better meet your needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record your screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start screen recording using Zoom.*

## Warm Up Questions - 5-10 minutes
* Before we start, I want to take a few minutes to ask you some questions.
* Can you tell me a little bit about what your role is? 

#### General product health questions
- How often would you ideally look at data for KPIs? Monthly? Weekly? Daily?
- Where do you go to look for data for KPIs?

## First task: React to Product Success Tool - Facility Locator KPI tracking

Okay, I am going to send you a link to look at the tool in Domo. Can you open that link and share your screen so I can see what you see?

* Take a moment to scan this page, and walk me through this page and what you're looking at. 
    * What is the purpose of this page?
* What steps would you take next?


## Second task: Interpret the data
Go through each section of the dashboard. 
- What is this metric and what is it telling you about your product?
- What would you do with that information?

## Overall feedback and sharing
- How would you share this data?
- If you need to report KPIs monthly, how would this help you?

* Is there anything that is unclear?
* Are there any metrics that are missing or anything that you would want added?
* After seeing these metrics, would you want to change anything about your KPI's?
* What was the hardest part of this process?
* What could we do to improve this dashboard for you?

* Do you have any questions?


## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the dashboard and make sure it really works for users.
