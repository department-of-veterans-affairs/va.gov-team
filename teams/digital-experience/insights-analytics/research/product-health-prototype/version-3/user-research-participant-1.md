Participant 1, Monday, October 7, 5:00pm ET

### Role:
- Product Manager - VAOS (VA Online Scheduling)
- Building on an existing app for veterans to schedule 
- Using analytics on the past tool to inform for the current build.

**What decisions would analytics data help you make?**

- Using it for what features people use; having different use cases

**How often would you ideally look at analytics data?**

- It depends: monitor performance and start with a small group of veterans to test within production and expand from there to see where performance criteria are met
- Afterwards, would probably scale back and look at it weekly.

**What metric is most important to you for determining the health of a product?**

- In theory, it should be: 
  - How many requests are completed and self-scheduled requests are completed successfully.
  - Improve the conversion funnel. Conversion rates compared to the top of the funnel.

### Prototype:
**Program description:** 

- It looks like you can toggle between the different education tools within the space. You can see a health meter.
 
**Targets:**

- Not sure what the target would be or where to see that. It would help to understand it if I knew the targets
- Confused by what’s going on from the combined score from target with the percent. How does the target get added up?
- Customer Sat: I would expect +29% to be helpful
- Are the targets customizable? That would be nice. 
- Would give a good baseline for customizing problems, but these aren’t in and of themselves necessarily problems. 
- I would think that some spikes of this would be expected depending on the time of the year
- Would be helpful to compare with traffic.
- Would be hard to get to positive and negative percent from target. Is positive good? Is it bad? It’s hard to understand that intuitively. (i.e. uptick)
--
- I’m not sure what the [specific form] is
- It’s hard to know how where the Form numbers are coming from. What an average user experiences or if it comes from the code? The forms can be pretty complicated depending on the user.
---
- It feels like there’s an opportunity to tie the goals to the metrics from the top. It would be stronger to enforce the KPI goals with the product health metrics. It might he hard, but it would be better than making hard numbers
- I like the page views chart
- For forms, would be good to see error rate submissions and number of completions

**Would you want to see the amount of downtime?**

- That’s different. Would want to see very low downtime; it’s usually some random service on VA that has downtime
---
- Paper form submissions aren't useful for me
- Funnel conversions are helpful to visualize. Would like to understand the split between VAOS now and the historical one.
- The backend system is going to be hard to get. 
---
- Customer satisfaction would be nice, but not sure if we collect the numbers on that.
- Through prompting, product specific CSAT would be helpful
---
- Likes contact center calls.
- It’s interesting to see the calls divorced from usage stats. Some ratio of traffic to contact center calls would be a more accurate assessment.
- Doesn’t know who answers calls for contact centers. Would like contact center information on who’s calling and for what

**Target Section:**

- Combining the metrics with KPI goals in a more structured way would be good. Defining percent differences with targets - right now, current way is confusing.

**How would you expect to set those targets:**

- Collaboratively with the Product Owner and Leadership. For him, setting against KPIs that he can track and against business level priorities

**Metrics that would be important for score**

- CSAT, min of downtime, form submissions in the context of usage stats
- Introduction page: doesn’t require you to be logged in

### Using the tool for Product Decisions:

- Trouble shooting would be easier: Fixing any sort of errors. Custom error reporting to fix why things are breaking. Making progress towards making the service work better.
- Prioritizing product decisions and features
- Tying business level KPIs set out for the product
  - A good check into the things that you’re doing for the business KPIs for the product
  - Tying implement strategies to the vision
### How would you share this data:
- Take screen shots, exports, put the dashboard into a weekly email for stakeholders

### Are there any metrics that you don't need:

- I don’t know when I would need paper form submissions, unless there’s a traffic spike online 

### Are there any metrics that are missing:
- As long as there’s a good way to summarize or cut things up, more info is better than less. May not need info all the time, but when you do need it it’s helpful to not spend so much time trying to find it. This is a good amount of info

### Other Questions:
- Does analytics have some sort of API to use to pull the stuff out or cut into to make making the dashboard easier?
