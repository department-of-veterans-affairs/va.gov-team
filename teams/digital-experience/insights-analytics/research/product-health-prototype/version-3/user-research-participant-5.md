Participant 5, Thursday, October 10, 1:00pm ET

## Role
Co-lead of va.gov platform

## Products
primarily concerned with enabling plaftform team, any product that is actually veteran facing, less concerned with how that gets built and is more concerned with team building it and that they have what they need.

## Product Health

- is it accessible, up and running
- can you do the thing you're supposed to be able to do with it
- works as it is intended to work
- has low, ideally non-existent levels of error rates
- ideally, indication of number of people using the thing and the increment of those people that are not able to accomplish the task it was set up to facilitate
- identify cases where failures happened, see if they are similar, work on improving the cause
  - wouldn't know what to do if the causes were disparate
- would love access to the data constantly and at a glance, from high level are things going well or not well
- live/ near-live data updates
- more interested in when things go wrong
- in a less immediate way, interested in the user experience over time
  - yes task has been completed, but experience of completion has degraded over time
  - would be intersted in this type of data each month

## Protoype

- immediately drawn to metrics dropdown
- paper form submissions, doesn't consider it a part of the product, is interested in paper form submissions for comparative purposes only if for ex. a goal is to decrease paper submissions
- doesn't know if 53 minutes of downtime is a lot or not
- had a hand in setting the target numbers, like difference from targets, indicator feels redundant, can just look at the difference from target, visually really busy
- the indicator does not feel fine-grained enough - what's the key for whether something is a `ok` vs `warning`

### Overall indicator

- how is it weighted?
  - would want to play around with weighting and have a hand in how it was set
- are metrics being combined in this indicator that don't map to each other?
- would be good fodder for a slide deck screeenshot

### Percent difference over time

- visually looks busy, but understands can mouse over different lines
- likes linear scale

### KPI goals

- not sure how the KPI goals are reflected in the metrics section
- would serve as a good reminder that there might be otehr things to take into consideration when assessing the health of the product

### Form data and metrics

- doesn't know why it's positioned right there, but informatino is helpful, but not so much personally
- feels like it should be up top
- average number of clicks is super important, reduce cognitive load, wants to see avg number of clicks over time
- more interested in unsucessfull submissions, would be excited to click into unsucessfull submissions and explore which specific ones
- would like to see funnel conversions over time
- given the stability of the site, would be surprised if there was much information on the downtime charts
  - product unavailability may be a better term for it
- customer satisfaction score feels like it should be up int he top of the section, maybe he can group them himself, ideally closer to funnel conversions
- loves survey prompt answers, informs future product direction, remidner to keep product aligned with needs of hte user
  - if there are free text or other associated questions would love to be able to explore that specific data
- not sure if the call center data is accurately capturing feedback on my specific product rather than education benefits in general, what is that feedback
- call center data only in extremes, for ex. huge spikes
- maybe appearance of data for call centers should appear more generalized so it communicates there isn't a lot of data to explore
- big picture directional stuff in the number of calls is more powerful than line graph

## What would you do with this info

- triage tool, clear indicators that it's not doing what it's supposed to be doing
- address immediatly problems
- if everything is fine, at the end of every sprint or month look together at this as a team and determine long term ways to keep tabs on product health
- would want everyone on the team to look at it, not just PMs
- building a review of product health based on the tool into some ritual that the team does on a regular basis
- slack bot integration for major swings, each team could finetune their own definition of what a "swing" is.

## Questions

- Is this a new user? how long have they had an account? how many times have they returned to the product?
- would go directly to GA less and ideally eventually replace it
