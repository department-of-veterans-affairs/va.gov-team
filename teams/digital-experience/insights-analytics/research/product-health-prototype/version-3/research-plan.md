# Research Plan for Insights and Analytics, Grey Sky prototype, September 2019

## Goals
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?
To learn what leadership and product owners want out of an analytics tool and how they will use findings from it

2. Background: The goal of the dashboard is to surface analytics with actionable items so leadership and product owners have information in order to make product decisions. 

3. Research questions: 
- What sort of metrics would lead people to make product decisions? 
- What will you do after viewing this dashboard?
- What information is missing or is there any extra information that's not needed?

4. Hypothesis: Some users will find one score helpful to compare different products, while other users will want to dig more into the data get a wholistic view. 

## Method
1.	What method of research are you planning? 
  - Directed interviews with low-fidelity prototypes, remote moderated

2.	Why this method? Leverages the current work and validates if we are moving in the right direction with the product. 

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? online using zoom or slack video with screensharing

4.	What will you be testing? Design mocks with fake data 

5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use: Zoom or Slack Video

## Participants and Recruitment
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?
Users/stakeholders:
DSVA: Leah, Chris, Patrick

2.	What is your recruitment strategy?

## When? 
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 
Next sprint

2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? Currently working to create the grey sky prototype after conversations with data stakeholders to make a realistic version of the blue sky prototype. 

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? about 30 minutes
