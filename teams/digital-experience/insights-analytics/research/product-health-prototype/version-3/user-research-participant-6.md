### Role
Product Lead for VSA: I oversee the PMs that lead all the VSA products and provide strategic guidance for all those product teams within VSA.

I manage product management practices. I ensure that these teams are defining meaningful metrics. I also help ensure that information is consolidated in an actionable way.
 
### General Product Health Questions

**What metric is most important to you for defining if a product is going well or not?**

I would split us into two camps: 1) how product work is done: setting KPIs and setting up feedback loops. 2) For the actual products themselves, I think submissions is always helpful, but I’m most interested in time to service, where service is the benefit that the veteran is requesting or when the veteran is asking for something and then receiving a response

**Do you have access to that metric?**

I don’t think so, but call center data would be helpful, but it may be a lack of digging into the data as opposed to it not being available.
 
**What decisions would analytics data help you make if you had it?**

Prioritize outcomes or decisions we would make.
 
**How specific are you expecting the data to be?** 

Looking at the data product by product would be helpful.

Another way would be benefit by benefit (being delivered)

In terms of granularity, I would look to Insights at whatever is statistically significant. Leaning towards monthly or quarterly
 
**How often would you want to look at it?**

Probably weekly.

With major decisions being made, probably more often than that.
 
### Prototype

**Program description:** 

I like the indication of the thing being delivered because it centers and contextualizes the page. It’s not really actionable, but orients what we care about.

When I look at the number of pages, I would assume that’s the paper version but that doesn’t make sense next to the number of clicks.

Number of overall submissions might balance out Time to Complete

**Targets:**
I think there is an assumption that we understand how these are defined, like Error Rate, Downtime.

**Where would you want to find that information?**

Right below it would be the easiest. Hover-overs might get too busy.

Actually seeing the target calculation and % difference is helpful

For 30 day total, is this the past 30 days or the previous month? I would not want to see the previous hour or day or week, which would introduce complications from being bogged down in the numbers.

It would be helpful to know the overarching base of the target; targets might be something that the teams define on a quarterly basis. The previous month or previous iteration might be a helpful starting point.

Seeing where the targets change over time (quarterly) might be helpful in indicating where we are in our health

The overall indicator is challenging because it’s difficult to understand the weights of the targets.

**Percent Difference from Target Over Time Section:**

This is awesome. It’s more helpful than seeing the combined target.

---

The KPIs are a little disjointed.

Maybe if these were color coded, they might be helpful in indicating where we are in goals 

---

Contact Centers

What does HRC stand for? 

---

What prompted a user to enter the funnel? Are we doing enough to capture those users as much as possible?

Making some sort of visual distinction between the targets, goals, and numbers would be helpful

The help hover overs would be helpful in knowing context for how to read these charts

I don’t lack trust in this and where these numbers came from, but some may question how we arrived at these data points.

**What is giving you that trust?**

The scales are not too granular or too wide. I don’t know if a change of scale prompt might help. The time scale helps in that I don’t think people would continue to refresh the page. 

**What would you do with this information:**

Make decisions on priority of what we would focus on next. 

It would validate or invalidate any hypotheses or bets. Then moving through KPIs to see if we hit them or not.

Milestones, like when something was launched, would be helpful.

**How often would you refer back and check these metrics?**

Probably a couple times a week. I don’t want to say once a day, but maybe 3 times a week

**Would you be looking at the same product or different products?**

Probably specific products instead of an all-compassing view of all products.

With any dashboard, it’s super easy to get spun around the wheel, just look at these and not understand what’s going on. For that reason, floating the goals [KPIs] higher might be more helpful and provide more context for the top targets.

 
### Other
Tabs; One page of these benefits with one key metric or at most 3 key metrics per benefit 

I think the Time to Service idea is the most helpful question we can answer.

If we’re finding that there’s a number of errors in trying to invest those errors

What’s missing: a one sentence “what the product is” written by the team and leadership 

Understanding where the targets came from, if the targets are editable.

With this being circled around a benefit, it’s great but might be a little more complicated around a team like Global UX that has a wide swath of products to care about.
