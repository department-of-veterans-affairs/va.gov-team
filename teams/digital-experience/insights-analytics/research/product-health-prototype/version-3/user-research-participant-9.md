# User Research Participant 9

### Intro

**Moderator:** Why don't you start by telling us about yourself.

My name is Rachael, I'm the product lead for VSP, and I manage the overall platform strategy and to me that means... helping set high level goals in the right way that enable the platform result in a VA.gov that is working and Veterans to get done what they need to get done.

**Moderator:** How do you do that? What are you looking for?

Specifically, how well VSP incentivizes agile and HCD and user and data based decisions in VA.gov products.

**Moderator:** And it's all VA.gov products?

Yes. But like.. the success of those products in terms of enabling user outcomes is an indictor but that is an indicator we are doing a good job on platform, but since those are our end users and not necessarily our customers, my direct custeomrs are VDS teams who are building for the end users. I'm spcificaly looking at how we are incentivizing things with our customers and looking at the end resutls of the thins they build to get a full picture of if we are doing the right things to ehlp them and if they are building the right stuff.

**Moderator:** How do you know what they've built is good or not?

It's kind of specific to the area but generally its wait times are going down, processing times are going down, user sentiment is positive, less cost for VA to keep it up the good work, more of the eligible population is served

**Moderator:** What decisions would analytics data help you make?

- They would helpme make decisions or assumptions about where in our service blueprint about where we are successful, or helping VFS teams be successful.
- For example, if we're seeing - 2 parts of our north star. 1 is that the things that people are building are changing things for Veterans, the other side is that A is able to do that at scale.
- If Im seeing that outcomes are good, but there are oly 3 VFS teams building concurrently, I know we are not successful and I would want to lean our product strategy towards how we can make it easier for people to come buil dion platform. Better documentation? Better tooling?
- If we are seeing lots of teams build on platform but are seeing error-riddled things launch, wait times not improving, abandonment rates are really high, that would indicate to me that we are doing a good job of welcoming peole and making it easy to build here but not doing a good job of ensuring quality and want to lean into more manual review processes or automated enforcement tools, but better incentivizing HCD or product strategy, etc.
- I'm not using the product data alone in a silo, but it's an indicator about one part of our north star. But our north star is 2 parts.
- Positive user sentiment, wait times dropping, abandonment rates dropping

**Moderator:** How often would you ideally look at that data?

- I think probably monthly
- There are other more granular indicatosr that I would look at on a daily basis but those are more internal platform indictars
- And those are more performance indicators rather than impact - like how producxts are doing and more platform OKRs are what I wuld look at monthly because I use that to inform big prioritization decisions, those are longer term


**Moderator:**  Can you talk through the prioritization decisions more?

- Let's say this month I check in and we have 30 teams building on platform but we see that also over that month or the past 3 months or whatever, there has been no wait time improvement on VA.gov
- That means to me I want to prioriztize more across VSP teams to incentivize HCD and user centered work to the VFS teams

**Moderator:** How specific wold you expect this data to be? Why is that level of detail useful?
- For me it's actually overall
- Not per product or per team or per form, but for VA.gov
- If I wanted to investigate or problem-solve - let's say for VA.gov there is a big array of performance and impact metrics I would look at:
- 	- Latency and uptime (performance)
- 	- Percentage of population served (impact)
- 	- User sentiment (impact)
- 	- Abandonment rates decrease  (impact)

I would want to see all of that for VA.gov in general to help me understand if platform is being successful.

If I wanted to investigate someting - let's say user sentiment is really down.

And I want to figure out how that is connected to what we are doing, I would want to see if it was for a particular product or a particular team - what did we do to suppor tthem that led them to deploy something that is getting such negative user feedback/

I would want to drill into the info that way, but on the montly basis I would look into VA.gov overall

**Moderator:**  So you would see montly overall that things are trending downwards, you wouldn't dig in and think that we are on the right path

- Yes, we are working toawrds a well-functioning VA.gov
- From a product strategy POV, I would make it easier and easier for VFS teams to build on the platform like automation and lean into the VFS team expereince side vs. putting up quality barriers

**Moderator:** Ok I'm going to show you the analytics dashboard - just a flat image if you could open it up in a browser tab and shar ethat window so you we can see what you are seeing

[does that]

**Moderator:** Look through this page and talk through your interpretations and thoughts as you go through
[Top of page]

- I'm seeing it's called a Gray Sky prototype
- I don't knw what Gray Sky means (I mean I do, but...)
- Ok, education benefits.
- I'm going to guess that this is going to show me various metrics about the education space
- [Reads]
- I don't think I'm familiar with this but it seems like I'm narrowed intto a paticular form so now I'm just going to be seeing info about that form only which for me isn't crazy useful
- I would prefer to see the sapce overall

[Reads]

- This is a description of how it works
- What I'm thinking is that it seems like it would be useful for a team who is in charge of improving the functionality of this form
- I'm more interested in understanding the raw outcomes of this form so that i know how it's driving outcomes for the platform

[Skims metrics]

Yeah so all of this stuff - except intro page views, those are important metrics for me in aggregate on VA.gov and if they are generally low, I would dig into that product or team

### So you'd wanna see it for all the forms on VA.gov not just one, the total.

- Yes
- Then if I'm seing the total dip below what we want to achieve, then I can dig in and see what teams built which form and we have the product directory to track that
- And I can know which VFS teams built them and we can dig into that and understand what was unique abotu their expereinces and change the VSP process or make it more standardized

[Skims overall indicator]

- Yeah even something like that on VA.gov but there are so many more thignsthan just forms on VA.gov
- I don't know how you would categorize the other stuff - claims status, edu ben status, facility locator... you might need a few indicators

It might be that user sentiment applies across VA.gov - top level metrics might be user sentiment, form processing times, I don't know... maybe call center stuff about the statuses but the main point is to reduce teh need for people to call into the call centers, udnerstanding the volume of those things would help us see overall, latency and downtime and error rates across all producst. Transaction - abandonment only matters for forms, not for each individual form, but I'd want to see form abandonment rates or form processing times at VA.

[Scrolls back up]

- Yeah those are the ones specific to forms
- Overall VA.gov user sentiment
- Call center volume for everything but specifically for status of products

**Moderator:** Would the forsee data fall under user sentiment?

-  Yeah that is basically what I mean. User satisfaction. I don't know if Foresee is the best way to capture that
- It would be amazing if one day we could do natural language processing on social media because I think many Veterans share and complain about VA on social media and it would be great to see if that would go down over time but that could be a risky thing to track

[Scrolls]

- Are these real? (High level KPI goals)

**Moderator:**  Realish - they are examples of what teams have written but not for this specific product

[Scrolls]

This stuff isn't useful for me because I'm not making decisiosn about these specific form

I'm interested in seeing downtime across products on VA.gov

**Moderator:** So you'd want to see downtime per product, but just the top 5?

- I'm not sure exactly what I'd want to see, but I'd want to know if there is some API that is consistently causing claims status to go out, for example
- Claims status is the top used feature on va.gov
- And the interesting thins that we woudn't go in and fix that product but it would help understand if we need to build a deeper relationship with that backend service and better integrate it with Vets API

**Moderator:**  So overall, what are your thoughts?

- I would come to this narrow of a page pretty infrequently but there is some data from here that if it were bubbled up to an aggregate, would help me understand how things are going on VA.gov overall
- Those are customer satisfaction, downtime, successful submission rate, call center calls
- That would be helpful at an aggregate level - understanding that some stuff can't be aggregated across all VA.gov but could stop at a form level hierarchy

**Moderator:** Would you want to see the producgs doing the best and the worst out of that highlighted?

- Yeah, probably - that would be an indicator of which team is performing the best and worst
- So yeah absolutely

**Moderator:** Would you want to see things against a target? How do you think the targets would get set?

- I would want ot see things against what I consider VSP targets
- What does VSP determine that private sector cross practice numbers shold be for things?
- I know teams set their own KPIs which is cool but maybe sometime their KPIs could be based on VSP - more aggressive or granular

**Moderator:**  So you have different set of targets you know what they are

- Yes, ideally they are aligned
- But a teams individual target might not be the same
- If I think abandonment across all forms should be 30%, and they set their KPI to be 70%, but that prob means that they aren't great at setting KPIs and they need help setting those
- I would still want to see if their thing was hitting 30% - not even their thing, but across VA.gov overall and if it wasn't I would drill down and see that they had it set to 70%


**Moderator:**  Do you know what those targets are?

- No, that is part of what we are trying to do from the beginning
- I think we might be trying to lean into that a little more with James and Naomi on Service Design
- I think we need to do some baseline setting to understand what is reasonable but that would evventually turn itno SLOs that peole cant launch unless it's meeting certain goals

**Moderator:**  What would you do with that info once you had it?

One metric in particular?

**Moderator:**  What I think I'm hearing is that this dashboard is not useful because it's too specific

- I would potentially use it today to see one data point
- If it's just one team building education tools, I would use it to see how that team is succeeding against what we hope they are succeeding at
- I don't think one data point is reliable which is why I want to see it across VA.gov
- I think I'm also not the target audience

**Moderator:**  Depends on who you ask! Any other questions?

I don't think so! I also understand we can't get to the bigger picture until we start with the smaller stuff so I'm excited to start here
