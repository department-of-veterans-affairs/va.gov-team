Participant 3, Wednesday October 9, 9:00am ET

### Role:

- Designer on the DSVA. I work on products related to education, some to healthcare, and platform wide products. Pretty much anything in the education portfolio. Everything related to managing benefits, checking the status of the benefits, checking payments. A comparison tool for getting benefits.
- Healthcare: facility locator for urgent care
### General product health questions: 

**What decisions would analytics data help you make?**
- One of the things we’re doing right now is looking at the 2020 roadmap. Looking at user pains and business problems. Analytics has helped us prioritized work (what are people actually using. Talking to stakeholders about how those products are being used). The stakeholders are curious if there are other people filling out the applications, if there are applications not being completed, what is the relevant use of different applications.
- Outside of VA.gov, we look at VA.gov analytics in relief of the other things Veterans are using. For example, phone calls against VA.gov, paper against VA.gov.
- I got the data myself in GA. I look at the data relative to the conversations I’m about to have. At least once a month, maybe twice

**Definition of a Healthy Product**
- It's relative to its intended business goal or intended use. For example, the number of veterans eligible for the education benefit that intend to use that benefit is roughly 1 million veterans. If I see only a few thousand a year out of the million a year is using that benefit, then I would say that it’s unhealthy. 
- Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs: At a basic level, it needs to be usable and needs to work and needs to be tied to a business and user outcome, with clear enough definitions of the user outcome for full usage.

### Prototype:

- I see a list of products. There’s a percent difference from target that’s close to what I described earlier, but from the chart, I’m not really clear which lines are which and which are good or bad.
- The percent difference from Target makes sense to me. The thumbs up or down is a little confusing: there’s something about that that requires a little bit of a cognitive pause. There’s an extra step I have to do with how the data is visualized. The combined target score is fine, but I’m curious how that would be actionable.
- Looking at the “Metrics for Veterans” line, I'm assuming it’s VETTEC. [Form wording/product wording]
- Looking at the UI, I can tell that I can toggle between the different forms, but then I don’t have the actual metrics, I just have the attributes of the application, but not an active metric. These are things that are already there, but aren’t changing metrics that I would use.
- Looking at the KPI goals, it wouldn’t be relevant.
- Page views and downward actually seem like metrics to me. [Starting to puzzle on things he would actually need to know.] I would be curious to see Page Views vs. Submissions.
- Downtime for month: there’s probably from an engineering perspective, a possible reason that’s affecting business goals. My assumption is that we’re trying to avoid downtime, and if there’s downtime it would fundamentally change our priorities. Same thing with backend systems.
---
- There’s a dedicated EDU call center, it’s called Muskeegee call center. If an education person looked at this, they would wonder why this call center data isn’t that. 
- I don't know what HRC stands for. Right now, there’s a daily email of staff ranking prioritiy of calls - it would have to be manually created.
- Looking at number of calls, the emoji’s are a little confusing. The thumbs up/down implies both directionality and mood. 
---
The combined target:
  - The good: A visualization from some sort of normalized measure of what we care about for what’s going 
  - The bad: Not clear on what’s above or below target. Not sure what to act on based on where we are for the targets. The combined score is hard for me to tease out how to act on it and pull it apart a bit. The meaning I can make from the Percent difference from target is way more useful than the one number target. 
    - Thinking about screen real estate, I’d rather have a couple of extra columns in the left table, for example:
      - Call center calls, what is the target? 
      - Is there directionality in the targets? I don’t think I know what these numbers represent. 
      - Is it based on today as compared to yesterday or this time last year? 
    - Having the target as a part of the chart would be great. This particular charat is interesting to me, I’d want to know what these particular things mean without having to scroll up and down. There’s nothing about this diagram that I can interact with based on what I see here. IE “I would click on this based on this. I would take this action based on what I see here.”
 
  - I love the idea of seeing relative health of products against each other (in the meter), but in the context of a single product it wouldn’t be as helpful.
---
- Is this all online forms? If it’s all online form submissions for all the products I’ve selected, then it would be helpful.

### What steps would you take next:

- We have regular weeklies with our business partners and the product team and contractors: I would want them all to have access to this. 
- If there are things in the prototype that would require attention, there’s almost an alert state that I wonder is missing, like a spike that we didn’t know why that happened. 
- The other way I would use this is seeing change over time. The current product health prototype iteration looks at single variables of products as opposed to multiple products over time.

### How would you do with this information:

- I would talk to my business partner as a part of the regular prep for the quarterly roadmap meeting as a way of having conversations about the relative health of the products and where we should invest limited staff and energy as opposed to those decisions being tied to things other than how well the product is doing. 
- I would definitely use these in presentations to show how the product is doing. 
- Would use to have conversations with other designers across teams. It would be interesting to see the relative health of those products. The relative health across businesses would be interesting to explore and discuss. 
- If I were in management, the more I can have an informed dialogue with health benefits, benefits/memorials, and -- , it would make it more effective to make product decisions.
