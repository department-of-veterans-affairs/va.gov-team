### Issue - Story Point Estimates 

In an effort to standardize Search & Discovery team estimates the below can act as a reference guide during team planning sessions and Github Issue tracking.  The below chart will be updated as we review the sprint pipeline reflected burndown and velocity estimations of previous sprint performance.   

| Scale  | Days/Weeks (Estimated)  | Story/Feature/Capability/Epic  | Description                                                            |
|--------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Partial Day             | Quick Fix / Very Small Story   | Trivial work, minor fixes                                              |
| 2      | 1 Day                   | Small Story                    | Easy task, work is known, can be executed quickly                      |
| 3      | 2-3 Days                | Story                          | Mostly known, doable                                                   |
| 5      | ~1 Week                 | Mid-Sized Story                | Becoming complex                                                       |
| 8      | 1.5 Weeks               | Large Story                    | complex task that will take a few days or longer                       |
| 13     | 2 Weeks / 1 Sprint      | Very Large Story / Feature     | Very complex / not all facets known, may take a full sprint or longer  |
| 21     | More than a sprint      | Feature / Capability (EPIC)    | Needs to be split                                                      |

*NOTE*:  Story points are unitless scales of measurement which are sized in relation to other tasks. This idea of relative sizing is the fundamental driver in Agile estimation and should help keep work effort streamlined and provide scalability forward. 

### Issue Etiquette
For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the [Standard Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=standard-issue.md&title=)):

- Title that explains task
- [Estimate](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WftRc1JeNxVAh7u1iiW5c5Et0HbM_uBqxhCXL6NGYog/edit)
- Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
- Labels: _vsa-search-discovery_ 
- User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
- Nested in an Epic

All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint.

### Team Norms

### Decision Etiquette
Decisions are part of our daily routine, the below questions can help kickstart the decision making and creative thinking process.
1. Is it my decision to make?
2. Do I have all the information to make the decision?
3. Do I have to make the decision now?

### Communication Best Practices 
- **Slack** 
  - Best communication method
  - Slack channels allow us to do our work in the open so that others can learn from the questions asked and the answers provided. Please do the same.
  - VFS teams should use public Slack channels as their first method of communication.
- Don't wait to organize a meeting to ask a question; this will slow our team down.
- Email - least effective communication method
  - Email communications are not easily searchable or archivable. Use this as a last resort for communication.

### Team Slack:
#va-search


### General things
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
