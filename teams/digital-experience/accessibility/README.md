## Accessibility in the Product Lifecycle

### [Product](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/product)
* Define accessibility as a business requirement from the start.
* Ensure the team has sufficient accessibility expertise.
* Plan for inclusive research.
* Meaningfully measure, monitor, and evaluate success goals, including accessibility and Section 508 compliance.


### [Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research)
* Define inclusive research strategies.
* Define goals and strategies for including people with disabilities (consider specific KPIs).
* Document gaps as potential risks to inform future research.


### Design
* Define how to help teams develop empathy for the diverse range of users, such as race, socio-economics, technology challenged, and people with disabilities.
* Document interaction behavior, and ensure it is accessible.
* Define criteria to evaluate the accessibility of designs, such as mobile-first, defining states, heading order, and focus management.
* Annotate semantic markup, reading order, focus management in designs to ensure development understands the fully designed experience.
* Use inclusive, accessible prototyping tools, such as Adobe XD and coded prototypes.


### [Development](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/development)
* Establish e2e tests that include the axe checks.
* Ensure engineers know how to customize tests to ensure hidden and dynamic content is also evaluated.
* Define workflow processes to evaluate 508 compliance and accessibility throughout development.
* Ensure foundational accessibility testing is complete ahead of reviews. | [Read about VSP-required foundational accessibility testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/guidance/staging-review-processes.md).


### QA
* Use QA techniques to evaluate accessibility and usability: manual processes, Web Vitals, CrUX dashboard.
* Define accessibility and 508 compliance QA processes for both before and after deployment.
