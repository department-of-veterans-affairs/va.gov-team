# Inclusive Design Guidelines

* Make text as readable as possible
  * Don’t overuse caps. Full-caps can be difficult to read and misinterpreted by screen readers.
  * Use camel case for multi-word hashtags. This makes hashtags more legible, more compatible with screen readers.
  * Avoid saying “click here,” “more,” “learn more” — link text needs to make sense in context, and should make sense when taken out of context.
  * Put hashtags and mentions at the end. Punctuation marks are read aloud by screen readers, so hashtags or @ mentions can disrupt copy.
  * Limit emoji use. Emoji also get read aloud by assistive tech. That means people will hear things like “loudly crying face” or “face with closed eyes and stuck out tongue.”
  * Use an adequate font size. Make sure the font is legible, especially if used in images or places that aren’t modifiable.
  * Limit line length. Lines that are too long can interfere with readability and retention.
  * Use True Text when possible. What’s True Text? Think of the difference between a blog post and a scanned PDF. True Text is easier to enlarge and translate. And it’s more compatible with screen readers or other assistive technologies.
* Provide descriptive captions for images. Tips for writing descriptive alt-text:
  * Convey the content and functionality of the image. There’s a huge gap between “Image of a chart,” and something like, “A bar chart illustrates that there has been a year-over-year increase in forest fires, peaking at 100 this year.”
  * Skip saying “image of” or “photograph of.” The Royal National Institute of Blind People says most screen readers prefer you don’t.
  * Mention color if it’s relevant.
  * Share humor. Descriptive text doesn’t have to be overly formal and should do its best to express what’s funny.
  * Transcribe text. If the image has copy that is central to its meaning, make sure you include it in the description.
  * Read it out loud. Alt text is often read by screen readers, so read copy aloud to hear how it sounds.
  * Learn from the best. WebAIM [https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/#basics] offers tips and good examples, Phase2 [https://www.phase2technology.com/blog/no-more-excuses-definitive-guide-alt-text-field] provides a number of scenarios, and copywriter Ashley Bischoff offers provides a number of tips [http://www.friendlyediting.com/assets/altrock/index.html#cover].
* Include captions in videos, and provide a descriptive transcript.
* Use a color contrast of at least 4.5:1.
* Don’t rely on color for meaning.
  * Visualize links. Add an underline or a hover animation to convey that hyperlinked text is clickable. Nielsen Norman Group has helpful guidelines for visualizing links.
  * Use symbols. In graphs or infographics, use symbols or patterns as an alternative or addition to color. Or, add clarifying labels.
* Avoid placeholder text for forms.
* Be thoughtful about representation. Recent findings on representation in media [Source](https://blog.hootsuite.com/inclusive-design-social-media/):
  * Men get four times as much screen time as women
  * Men speak seven times more than women
  * 25% of ads feature men only, versus 5% that feature women only
  * 18% of ads feature only male voices, versus 3% with only female voices
  * Women are 48% more likely to be shown in the kitchen
  * Men are 89% more likely to be shown as smart
  * Only 2% of ads show intelligent women
  * Women are shown in sexually revealing clothing five times more often than men
  * 40% of women polled by Unilever say they do not identify with the women they see in advertising. The study also found that almost one-third of women felt advertising depicts women as perceived by men
  * Only 2% of images in advertising feature plus-size women, even though they represent 67 percent of all women
  * Just 1% of ads surveyed by Unilever show women being funny
* Plan to test and iterate often, and embrace feedback.
