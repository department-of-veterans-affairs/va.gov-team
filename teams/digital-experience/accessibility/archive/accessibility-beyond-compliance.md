# Accessibility Beyond Compliance (ABC)
by [Elissa Frankle Olinsky's blogpost](https://adhoc.team/2020/02/07/accessibility-beyond-compliance/)

When thinking about web accessibility, many people tend to focus on checking the boxes: 
> “Let’s make sure we pass Section 508 compliance; let’s make sure we don’t get yelled at or sued.”

This is the fear mindset. 
It’s doing accessibility as a way of running away from pain.

## What is Accessibility Beyond Compliance?

Accessibility specialist Derek Featherstone has been speaking about the notion of [“Accessibility Beyond Compliance”](http://boxofchocolates.ca/archives/2008/08/16/one-two-punch/) for more than a decade. This concept acknowledges that you need to meet those standards, but accessibility doesn’t stop there. It’s possible to meet the standards, check the boxes, and still have someone who uses a screen reader not be able to navigate your site because your headings don’t make sense, your links are styled as buttons (or vice-versa), or you otherwise break expected patterns for how real people use real websites.

Accessibility Beyond Compliance isn’t about fear. It’s not running from something. It’s running to an equitable, inclusive future where end users participate in development and where people building websites think about how an actual human being will interact with them. It’s about not being content to rest on your laurels with a clean compliance scan, but instead embracing the work of welcoming your users in, learning how you can do better, and then doing it.

## Accessibility Beyond Compliance involves contributions from every member of a product team. 

- Product managers establish metrics to measure accessibility, identify opportunities to involve people with disabilities, and plan to evaluate accessibility of work throughout the product lifecycle.
- Researchers include people who use screen readers and other assistive devices in usability testing and exploratory research. 
- Designers think about why a link indicates a different action than a button and structure layouts to facilitate scannability. 
- Engineers ensure they use semantic HTML, where the code itself indicates the role of each piece of a page.

## When to think about Accessibility Beyond Compliance

We do not pass a site for an automated compliance check at the end of the process and wait to be told what needs to be fixed; the vast range of human needs permeates how and why we do work at every stage of a project. Everyone is responsible for talking about accessibility as more than treating edge cases and for supporting each other’s continued pursuit of usable accessible web experiences.

### Accessibility Beyond Compliance is not just about code, or laws, or checkboxes. <br/>It’s about embracing the rich variety of human experiences, and ensuring equitable access for all.
