# How an accessibility audit works

This document walks you through how a typical accessibility audit works. This helps especially if you haven't been through one in your current program or project.

## What does an audit do? 
The goal of an accessibility audit is to create an inventory of accessibility issues, then prioritize the impact of them in order to plan for remediation.

An accessibility audit provides an analysis of whether an interface meets [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) and [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). These standards help guide people in making websites and apps that work for as many people as possible.

## Who does an audit? 
Most of the time, an accessibility specialist will conduct the audit. However, it's also possible that a product manager, designer, researcher, engineer, or any other person on a team could perform the audit.

## When do we do audits? 
At a minimum, an audit should happen at least once before a project goes to production. However, if the audit occurs that late in the development cycle, that usually means more issues will surface and need to be fixed before the interface meets proper standards. Ideally, early prototypes and designs get reviewed for accessibility best practices before an interface gets built. This can happen at different intervals, depending on the scope and speed of the project or program. This may be a good time to gain semantic markup guidance, too.

## Why do an audit? 
An accessibility audit helps you know how your project or product stacks up to current accessibility standards and best practices. It can illuminate potential problems users with disabilities may have with your interface, and how much work you have to make that experience better.

## What's the general process? 
Accessibility should be approached as early in the product development process as possible. That can mean many different things depending on your program or project. That said, a process might look something like this:

1. Discover
    1. Define the problem
    1. Generate ideas
    1. Decide on a direction
1. Deliver
    1. Define a MVP
    1. Build and operate
    1. Learn and evolve

An accessibility audit can be initiated at any point during this process. The audit should be thought of less like a one-time event that happens before a project launches and more like a continual part of the product process. Ideally, an accessibility specialist reviews project requirements, research plans, early designs, and prototypes as well as auditing code on test environments as development happens. Steps of [an audit would include items like this](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/accessibility-dev-review-step-by-step.md).
