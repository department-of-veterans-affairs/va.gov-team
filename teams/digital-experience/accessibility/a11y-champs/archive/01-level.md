# Level 1

Time: approximately 1 hour

1. Set up your [Mac for keyboard access](https://dequeuniversity.com/mac/keyboard-access-mac). <br/>
    **How this helps:** Keyboard testing is one of the most basic and important things you can do to create accessible interfaces.

1. Install browser plugins for testing: [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/), [axe-coconut](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-coconut-web-accessibi/iobddmbdndbbbfjopjdgadphaoihpojp?hl=en) (exclusively for Chrome), and optionally, [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/).  <br/>
    **How this helps:** Automated testing can only catch about 30 percent of the types of accessibility problems in an interface, but it's a quick way to find the basic problems.
    
1. If you expect to have to ensure PDFs are accessible, recommend getting a copy of **Adobe Acrobat Pro**. Your VSA accessibility specialist has one, and your team's designer is likely to have it in their Adobe Creative Cloud license, as well.

1. Attend the A11yChamps welcome and training (an invitation will be sent). <br/>
    **How this helps:** Provides an opportunity to gain answers to any questions, provide feedback on how your VSA accessibility specialist(s) may best support you.
