# Facilitator Notes for Level 1

The goal of this first meeting is speak with the group about the Getting Started videos and resources, address any issues they may experience with initial accessibility testing set up for their Mac, and set the tone for the coming sessions.

* Any thoughts or questions on the Getting Started curriculum?

* What are some of your takeaways?

* Are there any issues setting your Mac up or installing plugins?
