## 1. How does testing with assistive tech work? Do we need a separate research plan?

AT research has the same base template for non-assitive tech research with additions based on what AT you will be testing. [Reference the assistive tech folder under research for additional AT-specific guidance.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/assistive-tech)

## 2. How do we recruit for assistive tech?

[Reference the for inclusive recruitment strategy document](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md)

## 3. How many people do we need to test with?

It depends on what you're testing for, what you're looking to learn, and what your constraints are in terms of time and resources. Generally speaking, the more you can test with the better. AT users have completely different tools, mediums, and strategies for navigating the web. As a result, it's hard to hit saturation in terms of common responses.

## 4. Should we test mobile or on desktop for assistive tech?

Both. Mobile is a rapidly growing area for AT users and will need to be accounted for when we make the transition to WCAG 2.1.

## 5. If we plan a mobile test, but a user ends up testing using desktop - does that negate findings?

This is on a case-by-case basis. In general, you'll want to be flexible with your participants. If testing on mobile doesn't work due to technical difficulties, it's OK to switch to desktop as long as you document what happened and any risks.

## 6. Is there a range of abilities we need to test?

Yes. Even among screen readers there will be a range of different abilities, preferences, etc. For example, someone with acquired low vision due to old age who uses a combination of a screenreader and magnification tools (e.g. Fusion) will have a completely different experience to navigating the web to a congenitally blind user who uses JAWS.
Reference the inclusive recruitment strategy document for more guidance.

## 7. Does a11y need to be on the call or is it something our team could run?

Having a11y specialists on the call is invaluable for solving technical difficulties (which is to be expected), interpreting AT user behavior, and providing recommendations for questions.

## 8. Can we do it in staging? Or does this need to be tested in production?

If you are testing with **NO** real user information then it can be done in staging.
If you **ARE** testing with real user information, then it needs to be done in production. 

## 9. How should I prepare for AT research?
