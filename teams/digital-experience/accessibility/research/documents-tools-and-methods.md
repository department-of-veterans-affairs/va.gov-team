# Documents, Tools, and Methods
The documents, tools, and methods we choose during research have a direct impact on who we are able to recruit and ultimately base recommendations off of. 

For example, if we only offer video interviews on desktop devices, we may exclude feedback from Veterans who:
- primarily use smartphones, 
- don’t have a personal computer at home (25% of all rural Veterans), 
- are homeless, 
- or have a low bandwidth connection. 

As a result, findings from the study will likely be desktop-centric and fail to meet the needs of the underserved Veteran communities listed above.

**Bottom line:** inaccessible tools can lead to recommendations that might exclude and further marginalize underserved Veteran communities.
