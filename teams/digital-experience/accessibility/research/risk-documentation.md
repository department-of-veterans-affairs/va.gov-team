# Communicating and Documenting Risk
Documenting risks in research:
- keeps us honest and transparent about our work
- provides guidance for future work (to mitigate the risks identified)
- prevents findings from being misinterpreted or misused

This is the next step should the earlier recommendations in this document be unattainable due to constraints in your study. 

**Documenting risks in your research will not be used in any way to judge your ability.** In fact, the hallmark of a reflexive and ethically in-tune researcher is being able to acknowledge the limitations of one’s research methods and identify where those limitations stemmed from. 

For example, what if your usability test showed that a navigational effort performed well, but you weren’t able to recruit Veterans who use assistive technology or mobile devices? You should note that your finding:
- is specific to desktop-centric Veterans who don’t use assistive technology
- does not account for the underserved Veteran groups captured in the VA recruitment checker 
- should have a follow up study that specifically targets to include them
- should only introduce changes that are thoughtfully considered to prevent the chance of unintentionally further marginalizing underserved Veterans

## Exclusion in Recruitment
The first step of inclusive design is recognizing exclusion. Follow the steps below to report out gaps in your sample and bring attention to underserved Veteran communities.

### 1. [Use the VA recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to identify exclusion in your sample

Follow the steps below:
1. Duplicate the template sheet and rename it to your study.																											
2. Enter the final number of participants into the cell next to "# of participants" (C2).																											
3. Enter the final number of AT users (J2) and no shows (Q2).																											
4. Enter "1" in each underserved category (rows) the participant (column) identifies with. A participant may identify with more than one category.								
5. Identify categories that don't meet their targets (in red) and provide an explanation or future research recommendations under the notes section.							
6. Take a screenshot of this recruitment checker and place it into your research readout and history folder.

> The 7th participant identified as over the age of 60 as a woman, so a “1” is placed within those respective rows. The 6th participant was a no-show, so their dimensions are marked with a “N.” The 5th participant did not identify with any of these dimensions, so the entire column is “0.” 

> Google sheets will not be accessible within the VA network, so if you're looking to share findings, take a screenshot or transition it to Microsoft Excel version.

#### What if I have no shows?
If a participant doesn't show up, fill out their column using "N" (for noshow) instead of "1" in each underserved category (row) that applies to them. For example, if your fifth participant doesn't show up, still complete their column using "N" instead of "1." In the notes section, consider writing if no shows resulted in underserved groups being left unaccounted for.

#### What if some underserved categories aren't relevant to my study?
If there are categories that are absolutely unrelated to your study, replace the target % with "Null"

#### What if I the recruitment survey didn't capture data for some underserved categories like "other than honorable?"
"other than honorable," "immigrant origin," and "expat," are currently unaccounted for in the recruitment survey. If no data exists, simply skip completing the row for each Veteran and write a brief note in the notes section.	For example, under notes, you might write "Our research did not include Veterans who were other than honorable or expats."

### 2. Add the participant checker into your research readout 
Take a screenshot of your participant checker and place it within your research readout. Write a list of the dimensions that did not meet the minimum to be representative. For example:

> #### Underserved groups in research 
> This research may not include the perspectives of the following underserved Veteran groups:
> - Group 1
> - Group 2
> - Etc
>

### 3. Copy the recruitment checker into your research findings presentation
Take a screenshot of the recruitment checker and add it to your research findings presentation using the [DEPO research readout template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13G80avWGdY7tHU40PbP_l05W1yRpDr-opOk0u_AAhzQ/edit?usp=sharing).

## Absence of Assistive Technology in Usability Testing
It will not be possible to include those who use AT if the research includes testing prototypes in tools such as InVision, UXPin, or Mural. If you’re unable to test with AT users, make sure to document that risk within your research readout and presentation:

> Findings of this study may not apply to Veterans who use assistive technology so we anticipate: 
> - the potential for more launch blocking 508 defects
> - a longer accessibility testing and remediation process
> - possible, unintended exclusion of Veterans with disabilities
> 
> To reduce the risk of excluding these Veterans, we recommend conducting usability tests with Veterans with assistive technology in staging or production within the next month or as soon as time and resources allow.
