# Research Plan for TIS E&E Portfolio Veteran Research - September 2022

## Background

The Eligibility and Enrollment product line is a part of the Veterans Experience Services (VES) portfolio. Our team aims to uncover the issues that Veterans and their families face when trying to determine eligibility and enroll in VA benefits and services.

In an [initial round of research review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VES/blob/master/research/background/legacy-e%26e-research.md), the E&E portfolio team explored several hypotheses regarding Veteran pain points. The team would like to test these hypotheses with a new round of research focused on speaking directly to Veterans about their experiences with eligibility and enrollment, both at a high level and specifically referencing health services and benefits at the VA.

### OCTO Objectives

This research supports the following objectives:

1.  Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online

2.  Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information

3.  Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey where they might need to determine their eligibility for VA services or benefits and enroll:

-   Starting up
-   Taking care of myself
-   Reinventing myself
-   Putting down roots
-   Aging
-   Dying

## Research Goals

The E&E portfolio team aims to understand:

-   How Veterans determine eligibility and enroll in VA health services and benefits
-   What differences exist between application processes (paper vs. digital)
-   Veteran pain points related to eligibility and enrollment

### Outcome

The findings from this research will be used for two purposes:

1.  Enabling the PTEMS VES team to document the current eligibility and enrollment journey
2.  Enabling the TIS team to create a vision of an eligibility and enrollment experience that is informed by the VA's current processes and systems, but does not necessarily rely on them - instead centering Veterans and how to best meet their needs.

This vision will be delivered to our VA stakeholders through a presentation and a set of artifacts based on our research.

### Research questions

This research will help us understand:

-   How Veterans navigate the current eligibility and enrollment processes for health benefits
-   What touchpoints Veterans have with the VAMC and HEC and their staff
-   Pain points relating to eligibility and enrollment
-   What systems and processes might support Veterans in receiving the health benefits they've earned - and how the VA's current E&E architecture supports (or fails to support) their efforts

### Hypotheses

-   Veterans find that the overall benefits landscape is overwhelming and confusing.
-   It's hard to find benefit information that applies specifically to them.
-   Determining personal eligibility is difficult and the processes are unclear.
-   The difficulty of getting required documentation for eligibility applications provides a significant barrier to seeking benefits.
-   Entering the same information multiple times is frustrating for Veterans.
-   Processes for review and approval lack transparency.
-   Communication between VA staff and Veterans is often delayed, unclear, unhelpful, or distributed in multiple places.
-   Eligibility and enrollment wait times and delays cause some Veterans to abandon the application process.
-   The current eligibility and enrollment process is not accessible for some Veterans.
-   It can be difficult for a Veteran's caretaker to gain access to help with the E&E process.

## Method

We will conduct semi-structured interviews with Veterans.

### Location

Interviews will take place remotely on Zoom.
