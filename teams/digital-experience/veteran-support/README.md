## About This Team

The Veteran Support Crew leads the digital support experience on and for VA.gov and the VA Health and Benefits app. We bridge the gap between Veterans & VA staff by providing tools, information, and coordination to product teams, the helpdesks, and the end users.

### North Star 

Ensure Veteran problems are quickly addressed through a seamless experience that connects users to support tools and channels and collects data to drive improvements. 

We imagine a support experience that: 
- makes the VA support bureaucracy invisible to the Veteran by surfacing the relevant content, tools and support channels so Veterans can decide how they want to get help.
- quickly identifies recurring problems or pain points through feedback and data, and empowers teams to quickly solve them.
- proactively informs and collaborates with VA support stakeholders to ensure the best possible process for resolving VA.gov user issues.
