**Current Landscape**



* ID.me has phone support but can only be used for direct escalations from HRC. The phone number is not shared with the user.
* MHV has an online support form.
* There is no Tier 3 support for the VAHB app.
* Technically, HRC provides Tier 1 support, but the EVSS helpdesk receives escalations.

**Future Landscape (Short-Term)**



* The Veteran Support team does not operate in the HRC MS Dynamics instance. 
* Whether the starting point should be MyVA411 IVR or a separate number and IVR for support is still being determined. 
* Regarding account creation and sign-in support, cases will be sent to MyVA411 or one of the credential providers, depending upon the selection.
* The HRC helpdesk is used for health tools or mobile app support.
* MyVA411 is used for all other questions (non-health benefit tools and products).

**The future landscape of Tiers 1, 2, and 3 **



* Tier 1 support for VA.gov will start at an IVR. This will be updated to call out for help using VA.gov and will direct people to one of the proper channels for Tier 1 support.
* The Veteran Support team, operating at Tier 2 in the future landscape, will handle escalated calls from MyVA411 and the HRC helpdesk. Their responsibilities include conducting additional triage, documenting issues, resolving problems, or collaborating with the VFS team for resolution. 
* Tier 3 tickets will continue to be managed through AVA queues, serving as an additional support modality. This means that service issues from all three tiers will be covered, ensuring comprehensive support across the board. 

**Best practices for the future landscape of contact centers **


### **1. Define Clear Roles and Responsibilities**



* **Tier 1 is the first contact point** for general inquiries and basic support. Tasks include handling common questions, basic troubleshooting, and routing calls to the appropriate tier.
* **Tier 2** handles more complex issues that Tier 1 cannot resolve. Tasks include in-depth troubleshooting, specialized support, and resolving escalated issues.
* **Tier 3 **deals with the most complex and specialized issues, often requiring subject matter experts. Tasks include handling critical incidents, performing deep technical support, and working on routed cases from Tier 2 escalations.


### **2. Implement a Robust Knowledge Management System**



* **Centralized Knowledge Base:** Ensure all tiers have access to a centralized and updated knowledge base. This knowledge base will help Tier 1 resolve common issues quickly and allow Tiers 2 and 3 to provide solutions for recurring problems.
* **Continuous Learning:** Regularly update the knowledge base with new information from customer interactions and industry trends.


### **3. Establish Efficient Communication Channels**



* **Internal Collaboration Tools:** Use tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or similar platforms to facilitate real-time communication between tiers.
* **Regular Meetings:** Schedule regular cross-tier meetings to discuss recurring issues, share insights, and improve processes.


### **4. Streamline the Escalation Process**



* **Clear Escalation Path:** Define a clear and straightforward escalation path from Tier 1 to Tier 3. Ensure that each tier understands when and how to escalate issues.
* **Documentation:** Each case should be documented in detail before escalation to minimize information loss and ensure a seamless transition between tiers.


### **5. Utilize Advanced Analytics and Metrics**



* **Performance Metrics:** Track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as First Call Resolution (FCR), Average Handling Time (AHT), Customer Satisfaction (CSAT), and Net Promoter Score (NPS).
* **Feedback Loop:** Use analytics to identify trends and areas for improvement. Implement a feedback loop where insights from Tier 3 are used to train Tier 1 and Tier 2 agents. (See #8 for more )


### **6. Leverage Omnichannel Support**



* **Unified Platform:** Integrate all communication channels (phone, email, chat, social media) into a single platform to provide a seamless customer experience.
* **Consistent Support:** Ensure customers receive consistent support regardless of their channel and that information is readily available across all tiers.


### **7. Invest in Advanced Technologies**



* **AI and Automation:** Implement AI-driven tools like chatbots for Tier 1 to handle routine queries and basic troubleshooting. Use automation to streamline workflows and reduce manual tasks.
* **CRM Integration:** Ensure the  Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system is integrated across all tiers to provide a unified view of customer interactions and history.


### **8. Continuous Training and Development**



* **Skill Development:** Provide training and development programs for agents at all tiers to keep them updated with the latest tools, technologies, and best practices.
* **Mentorship Programs:** Implement mentorship programs where experienced Tier 3 agents can train and guide Tier 1 and Tier 2 agents.


### **9. Focus on Customer-Centric Culture**



* **Empathy and Understanding:** Train agents to approach customer interactions with compassion and understanding. Ensure that customer feedback is taken seriously and acted upon.
* **Personalization:** Use data and analytics to personalize customer interactions and provide tailored support.
