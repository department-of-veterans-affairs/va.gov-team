# A11 Intercept Survey 2.0

## Overview
The A11 intercept survey serves as the global feedback tool, randomly presented to users across VA.gov. It provides a mechanism for collecting user feedback on various VA.gov experiences and establishes a baseline for customer satisfaction to track progress over time.


## Problem Statement
While the survey aligns with OMB guidelines for feedback collection, it falls short in enabling VFS teams to easily access and utilize the data for their own metrics and product improvements.

We believe there is an opportunity to design and implement an enhanced survey experience with improved questions and methodology. This updated approach would not only maintain high survey participation but also generate higher-quality feedback, better supporting actionable insights for VA.gov's ongoing development.

### Desired User Outcomes
- Increased survey completion rate - Users feel motivated to complete the survey without frustration. 
- Minimal disruption - the survey feels unobtrusive and does not hinder a user from completing their task (benefits application, prescription refills, etc.)
- Accessible design - the survey is fully accessible for users of all abilities.
- Ease of use - Survey is intuitive and quick, requiring minimal effort to complete. 

#### Undesired User Outcomes
- Survey fatigue - users are overwhelmed by repeated or obtrusive survey prompts and begin ignoring them.
- Disruptive - survey impacts the user journey in a significant and negative way.
- Incomplete responses - abandoning the survey halfway

### Desired Business Outcomes
- Increased survey response rate
- Increased CSAT score in line with OCTO OKRs
- Higher quality / more complete data on user satisfaction

#### Undesired Business Outcomes
- Lower quality data / rise in incomplete surveys
- Decreased survey engagement
- Data bias - survey methodology skews data leading to unrepresentative feedback

## Current State
### Targeting parameters:

- Loyalty factor of 60 second or longer session
- 25% of users who hit the loyalty factor
- Based on sessions, not users
- Pop up window
- If a user declines an invitation, does not intercept for 90 days
- If a user submits a form, does not intercept for 90 days

- Percentage of VFS teams with surveys
- % Change in CSAT Scores

#### Baseline KPI Values
- **TBD**

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)

#### 2025 Objective 1: VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.
1.1: Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.

## Assumptions
#### User / Design Assumptions
- Survey methodology matters - timing and context for when users are presented with the survey will impact response rates / data quality.
- Users have limited time / patience - visitors to VA.gov are task-focused and may not want to spend significant time on surveys.
- Refining the questions we ask may result in better survey response quality. 
#### Project / Operational Assumptions
- VSignals will be able to work efficiently with our team to create a global intercept survey. **[Biggest risk / blocker]**
- We have the ability to create reports around Medallia data, integrated with existing analytics tools.

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

## Launch Dates
- **Target**: TBD
