## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
Becky: So we're ready to get started, and we'll first start with just learning more about your general experience with VA customer support. And so firstly, how long have you been a veteran?

> P2: I retired in [number], so just over [number] years.

Becky: And in that two years, have you ever used the contact page on va.gov?

> P2: Yes.

Becky: Can you walk me through your most recent experience with using the page and, you know, what you're trying to look for, and if you're able to find the information you are looking for?

> P2: Yeah. So my most recent using it was for my son. So I transferred GI Bill benefit to him. And so we were looking for, he had gotten a payment for education benefit, and it didn't, the amount didn't make sense.

> P2: So we went to the contact me page. I was with, me and him, and we started with the chat bot asking about what was the most recent payment, and then it said it couldn't, it couldn't get recent payments.

> P2: And so we went back to the contact me page and used the secure contact page to send an email or basically a message through the system. And then, yeah.

> P2: So that was the, that we we got a response 2 days later. So I had to go back in and found the, found the response and using the same system. So kind of came back 2 days later to the same page.

Becky: Got it, and you know, you mentioned with the chat bot, you didn't quite exactly get your answer with the messaging. Were they able to successfully answer your question?

> P2: Kind of, it was a, the response was, I asked, because in my experience, I know I have to be as detailed as I can.

> P2: So my question was, you know, I thought, well spelled out like, explain the most recent payment, and the response back was that payment hasn't been processed yet, so we will know once it's processed. Although I had been paid so, or he had been paid, so I kind of changed my expectations to, maybe we'll know more in October.

> P2: Once the new one, it processes, which sounds like it hadn't processed. So kind of answered it.

Becky: OK, that's, that's a relatable customer experience from, from my own experience as well. So I guess are you planning on following up or, or even calling?

> P2: we won't call. I don't have that kind of time. And it's just, it's super frustrating to be on hold for hours.

> P2: So typically, I try and resolve it all through message apps. It's not an emergency by any means. In this case we'll just wait for the next month.

> P2: In this case, it would be a little different, because he has another scholarship. So that's paying. So I'm not in a dire need for an answer.

> P2: So we would, we talked about it. We'll wait until October payment, and then, if that's not resolved, then reach out again.

Becky: Got it. Did you ever before using the chat bot, or messaging? Did you ever try to find the answers online first, through searching. And how did that go? If you did.

> P2: Yeah. So we do a lot of searching through, especially for benefits part through Reddit. There's a really good stream on Reddit for veterans, benefits. And so I search for that.

> P2: This one was a little nuanced because it's a state of Florida thing. I'm using a State of Florida benefit and a VA benefit. And so there's a lot of, you know.

> P2: It's a, it's a pretty nuanced thing that I couldn't find a whole lot of information about so, but yeah, I always start there first. Before I go to the VA website, I try and read there first to see if I can find anything else, and then go to the VA Website.

Becky:  Got it. Yes, we've heard from veterans, too, that Reddit is a very useful resource to hear from other veterans with similar situations. But it sounds like this is a very, it sounds like this is a very specific situation. So it was hard to find some answers there.

Becky: I'm curious. Is there ever a situation where you would use, where you would call VA to get an answer, maybe more immediately, or I know you try to do things online first. But can you imagine a situation where you might use other contact channels?

> P2:  I can't, because my experience with calling in has been more frustrating than just sending a message. because of my past experience. No, I would. I would almost always.

> P2: I would always start with the chat bot, if that's possible. But I know there's limitations to that. I know it's new and getting better, and it's way better than it was even 2 years ago.

> P2: But yeah, I would. I can't think of a scenario unless it was an emergency, I had to talk to somebody now. But I haven't run into that yet.

Becky: Yeah. And I'm curious. Has your past experiences with calling VA or calling customer support in general, sort of given you the expectation of of what a phone call might be?

> P2: The VA

Becky: Okay. VA, gotcha. 

> P2: Yeah. Well, I'd say in general for all the things I reach out to first, like I think about like credit card or bank, or something like that. I will, I will, I will never call. I will always try that.

> P2: I will. I will revert to chat bot, which never works. Well, not never, hardly ever works for what I'm asking. And then personal human chat. And then email. And then call.

> P2: Well, maybe even send a letter before I call. But I haven't run into that yet.

Becky: Yeah, no, it's helpful to like. I see the your internal triage, for you know where to start, and then where to go from there. I'm curious, you know you mentioned using Chatbot, and how that often doesn't work. But but it seems like you still go back to using Chatbot. Is there any any particular reason why?

> P2: Typically cause. That's where you have to start. If you don't, like, I'm thinking other things. Not necessarily VA, because, VA, I can just send a secure message.

> P2: But typically like a a bank or credit card, you almost always have to start with the chat Bot, and I'll ask the question. It won't understand. And so I'll just type human or operator, or something to override the system, you know, to to make it go to a human chat.

Becky: Got it. Okay? So what you're talking about is more the like Chatbot to live agent chat experience you've had on other on other sites.

> P2: Yes

Becky: Great well, thanks, for you know, walking through your your process in the past with using the Contact us page and with support with VA.

## Scenarios
Becky: For the rest of the session, now I'll give you 2 scenarios where you, as a Veteran, would reach out to VA for help. And these scenarios are actually real questions Veterans asked us this year, just reworded. So before we do that, do that, I'll send you a link to our current Contact us page. 

Becky: And then, and let me know if you have any trouble with opening that.

> P2: Got it? Well, maybe here it goes. Well, try again. Okay I have it.

Becky: All right, and have you shared your screen on Zoom before?

> P2: Yes. I'm not as good at this as Teams, but here we go.

Becky: No worries. Okay awesome. That was amazingly quick. So that's great. Alright. So I'll give you your first scenario. Now, again, we'll review two total scenarios in this session.

### Login scenario
Becky: So I'd like you. Oh oops all of my screens. Just minimize. Okay, I'd like you to pretend that you're a Veteran, and you're having trouble creating an account on VA.gov.

Becky: So you're trying to create a Login.gov account. But Login.gov doesn't let you use your passport as a form of identification. However, you don't have your driver's license or any other forms of identification. You've you've recently lost your driver's license. So that's why you're using your passport.

Becky: So starting on this page, the one you have open right now, can you show me how you would find help for this scenario? And as you're showing me, just tell me what you're thinking and noticing, too, on the page. And yeah, that's the scenario.

> P2: I think this is a very. It seems like my my chain of thought is, it's kind of a specific request again, so I probably would not use the chat Bot. Knowing the functionality of the chat bot.

 > P2: I would not go to the call us, because I don't. I don't want to do that. One thing that does that stick out to me is the frequently asked questions. So I might look there to see if there are any topics that might be helpful how to use VA.gov to manage your benefits, it might be there.

> P2: So I would probably click. Don't you just go ahead and click around. Is that okay?

Becky: Go ahead and interact. 

> P2:  Okay, so I probably click in here. And it was the id me, was that the one or which? Which? Which one am I trying.

Becky: Yeah, you're trying to create an account with Login.gov, but you can't use your passport. That's the scenario or the problem right now.

> P2: Okay, so I don't know, so maybe it would be signing into VA.gov. Issues with signing in. I see here. What if I don't have... It doesn't really give me the information here that I'd be looking for.

> P2: I might look under problems. Try and do a search. 'logging in.' Oh, by the way, typing in front of people is my biggest fear.

Becky: It's all good.

> P2: So see if that gives me anything problem long again. I don't know if it will. Issues with, you know, it's kind of issues of signing in. But it doesn't really say. And this is not going very quickly. Starting again. Try that again.

> P2: Looks like it's locked on my side, which doesn't really surprise me.

Becky: Yeah, no worries while we're while this page is loading. Some follow-up questions for me. So you know you, it seems like you gravitated towards the FAQ link, first on the Contact us page. 

Becky: Would you expect to see this type of support on a on a Contact us page on the website?

> P2: Yeah, I would only because I mean, if it's a, if it's a login issue, I guess it's not really a login issue.

> P2: It's a creating a website issue or creating a login account issue. I would, I would think it would be.

> P2: I mean, it's definitely on the before the firewall or before the login, you know, on the front side of the page as opposed to behind the sign in because I'm having trouble signing in, so I can't get to the other side.

> P2: So that's where I would expect it to be.

> P2: I would think that there would be something my, my whole login is not going here or the whole website's locked up for me

Becky: That may be an issue on our end. So don't worry about trying to search right now.

> P2: Yeah Ok. So I think, I think it would be about, you know, more of a discussion on what are acceptable forms of ID or something like that for login.

> P2: I think I would find that that would make sense to me to be in a frequently asked questions page.

> P2: And if it yeah, that that's why I would expect to find it if I couldn't find it there.

> P2: I know if I tried to do that through through Ask VA, there's a secure and a non secure side.

> P2: So that would be my next. If I couldn't find anything there and I had already used Reddit, that would be my next. That would be my next line would be to contact through the Ask VA link there.

Becky: And I know this question maybe a bit biased because you already have experience with Ask VA, it seems, but what do you think contact us online means

> P2: That would be through the secure messaging system where it's going to go to a A, VA, you know, the, the right VA Rep that can answer that question and get it back to me via, well I mean it's a secure system.

> P2: So it would come back to me, I'd get an e-mail that said, hey, there's an answer, go back and check it out.

> P2: And I would expect in this case, I wouldn't have to log in to get the answer because I don't, I can't log in.

> P2: So I would think there would be a difference between, you know, just a general question and a secure question about my account specifically.

Becky: Got it. No, no, that totally makes sense. And yeah, the the reason why I asked you is sometimes, you know, this language can be a bit ambiguous or general contact us online.

Becky: But it sounds like, you know, you have an understanding that this means to send a message, a secure message.

Becky: I notice you use that phrase in particular to send a secure message to VA. Yeah, that makes sense to me. 

Becky: And real quick, going back to the FA QS Section 2, I wanted to ask what do you think resources and support means?

Becky: This is another, you know, phrase we use to to talk about this section of the website.

> P2: I would think, let's see. So FAQs, step by step guides and other resources. Other resources might be I, I kind of think, I'm not really sure what a different resource would be other than like, like at work, we create a one pager document that has a picture and some information about something that you, you know, a specific area of a website you might be interested or something like that.

> P2: So maybe that, but I can't think of any, you know, an an other resource other than what would be covered in FAQ because to me, step by step guides come from the FAQ. How do you do this? And then it'll reference you out and give you step one through 10. This is how you do it.

> P2: But I'm not really totally sure what another resource would be.

Becky: No, that's helpful to to hear how that phrase is still a bit confusing in relation to, you know, the other, the other pieces of content we have outlined here.

Becky: So you mentioned, you know, going through the FAQ section, then you would try to send a message if for whatever reason those two channels do not work out.

Becky: What would be your next step in sort of trying to get an answer to to your login account creation issue?

> P2: I might look at helpful online tools. I saw that there, which seems a lot like, wait, is that the FAQs? Oh, yeah, I just noticed that. So I might look at what that is helpful Online Tools, which looking at this box, I don't think that really does anything that I'm looking for.

> P2: So, so chat bot didn't work.

Becky: A similar question. What do you think a helpful online tool is? What is an online tool you can think of?

> P2: It seems like those are the online web forms forms things that I would normally long time ago fill out in paper, but just the electronic version of those like address changes or these are all forms that I would have filled out in paper years ago.

> P2: And so it looks like helpful, the helpful online tools are these four things limited to these four things which don't look like anything that I need to do.

Becky: OK great. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you too. I think you're going going past the online tools when I asked a follow up question.

> P2: Oh yeah, I would, I would try that. And if that didn't work, then I would be have to call somebody.

Becky: Got it. Yeah, let's, let's have a look at this section again. Your, your challenge is you only have a passport and Login.gov's not letting you create an account on va.gov with just your passport and you don't have a driver's license because you lost it.

Becky: So given that, which, how would you decide to, how would you decide which phone number to call based on this list?

> P2: I, I think it's a general question. So kind of looking here, I mean, this is the everything pile, which is monster to get through, but that's kind of the first option.

> P2: It's not I I wouldn't use the TTY because I don't have I think that's a hearing impaired thing that I don't need.

> P2: It's not a VA benefits question because it's into that. It's into, I can't get into the page at all.

> P2: It's not a GI Bill question. It's not a homeless question. Health benefits is still within the website that I can't get into my health.

> P2: That same thing. Other helpful numbers. I could look there. I'm hesitant, although I would say probably what I would do is just call the that number.

> P2: I think now that I've seen this, I might click on the full list of numbers and see if that gets me somewhere better than the general number.

> P2: But but if you weren't here asking me this, I would probably just dial that number. I would dial the the the 411 number.

Becky: Got it. And have you called the 411 number before?

> P2: Yes.

Becky: Okay, great. 

> P2: But I think this number should be up higher, this other helpful number, because I think, like me, I'm hesitant to call this 411 number 'cause I know it's going to take a long time and I'm going to go through six different levels of prompt to get to where I need to go.

> P2: Probably unless it's well set up and website access is at the beginning of it. This number or a call out to say if you're having trouble logging in here's where you go.

> P2: I think that could be helpful and and and relevant to the general population that probably is having trouble logging in now that that's that I I feel like that could be a really common question for people on this website.

Becky: That's an interesting point you call out in that. So currently on this page, it's it's very much organized by how you would contact VA, but not what you would contact VA for.

Becky: So are you saying it would be helpful to call out like those common questions in addition to contact channels or I'm curious like in searching for contact information like what are you looking for first, the subject or how to contact?

> P2: And I'm speaking, I know that the VA population is very diverse and age and range from 23 to 103. And so I'm talking for the group of people who are on the Internet every day using it all the time. And that probably ends somewhere, you know, in the 70s or people not doing that.

> P2: But from everybody 65 and below, my perspective is they're probably using this website to gain access into the system. And so if I had a question about my VA benefits for me, and I feel like a lot of other people, they're going to log into this website, try and find information about the VA benefits.

> P2: And if that doesn't work, then they would need to call.
 
> P2: But to put a contact us, a phone number on the front page. It's important 'cause maybe it could be here, but I feel like the only time I ever get to this is when I can't find it somewhere else.

> P2: If I can't find the information somewhere else, then I'm going to call.

> P2: So my feedback is that this other helpful numbers, if it was up higher or included something that said, if you're having trouble accessing the website, call this number.

> P2: That could be more. I didn't even know this was, and I don't know that there's a, you know, website access help number, but I feel like it probably is and it could probably be pulled out a little bit to make it a little more clear that I don't have to call this dreadful 411 number that takes forever in my perspective.

Becky: Got it. So you're looking for like that direct phone number rather than, you know, very general number. OK, yeah.

Becky: Do you do you want to click into the other helpful, that link under other helpful VA numbers to see if there's another numbers?

> P2: OK, so Maine, so this is kind of breaks it down a little bit more. I'm scanning looking for a access burials and memorials bits thinner.

> P2: Yeah, it doesn't look like it's on here. My quick search looks like it's not.

> P2: It's just more kind of a breakdown of the other sections that were there or maybe more specific, which this is helpful to not have to go through the chain tree and also understanding that kind of different areas might have different times that they're available makes sense to me.

> P2: But just checking again. Yeah, I don't I don't see anything specific about website access.

Becky: OK, yeah, so and you know, you scan the article. I know you said you probably wouldn't click on that if I wasn't here, but let's say in this scenario you would and you know, you don't find the phone number. What would you do in this case?

> P2: Now I I call the 411 number.

Becky: OK, gotcha. That's what I thought too, but you know, I just wanted to confirm. OK, awesome.

Becky: So I think that that brings us to the end of this first scenario around login. So could you select the contact us at the top next to sign in and this will take you back to the contact Us page?

Becky: Great. Ok, that's loaded. Now I'll give you your second and final scenario.

### Claims scenario
Becky: So you're imagining you're also a veteran and you currently get disability compensation for shoulder pain, but you notice your shoulder has been hurting more in the past couple of months and you want to know if you can request more compensation for your shoulder pain because it's worse now.

Becky: So again, starting on this page, show me how you might find help for this new scenario.

> P2: OK, I think I would start with the chat bot because I, I feel like the chat bot has some things that it can do here.

> P2: And so I would select the chat bot, I would click and start chat and see and I'll see if I can do increase, request increase. I don't know what it'll do here.

> P2: OK, to clarify, did you mean ratings, claims information? I think, oh man, I think I mean claims information.

> P2: OK, OK. Find out if you're eligible for disability. You already did that. Gather evidence. Be sure your claim is filled out completely. Learn about fully developed claims, find out if you'll need to turn additional forms.

> P2: So I think I would go to this how to file a disability claim. So I think I click on there and then OK, fully developed claims, additional forms.

> P2: Do I submit evidence, tend to file? What happens after I file the claim?

Becky: what you're doing is just scanning the page right now?

> P2: Yeah, just scanning the page, looking at the bold areas and seeing if they're.

> P2: Because I think, I think what I already know is that I can submit a claim based on what's an increase based on conditions that I already have.

> P2: So I think I can file for disability compensation online and I, I, I think there's a prompt there about what condition, if it's an already existing condition that's already been reported.

> P2: So I think I would, you want to go ahead and do it.

Becky: Let's pause here. I'm curious, Let's say in this scenario, you do you, do you have no familiarity with that form and you're looking to confirm if you can even increase it? So how would you look for that? Since you're looking for information, how would you find that information?

> P2: Yes, I think I would learn about eligibility. Am I eligible? So this is compensation. OK, So I know what compensation is. I'm still kind of looking here things that are covered.
 
> P2: Learn how to apply for a discharge, that's not it. I'm still looking for where it says if I already so this one says you, you have a current illness that can affect your body and I served on active duty.

> P2: Yes, one of these must be true. You have a service related, I'm sorry you got sick or injured while active duty or no, you have an illness before you join the military and made it worse.

> P2: No disability that didn't appear until after you ended now. So it would really fall under this one. I got sick, but I've already been rated for it. So that one's kind of not necessarily where I'm going here.

> P2: Now you made me question whether I know what I know. I would go back to this disability benefits page. And you're right.

> P2: I'm I'm now trying to figure out what I'm, I'm kind of just clicking around looking for information because I'm not really sure where I'm going here here.

> P2: OK, so this did go back to manager disability and I see this file a claim for VA disability increase. So I probably lucky happenstance on to that based on getting back to this page.

> P2: So I would click on here. There it is. This one looks like, yes, the file for disability compensation benefits. So it took me here.

> P2: So before filing for a claim increase, we want to check and see if you've already got the maximum. OK, so this is this is the right page that I'm on.

> P2: So I click on to start the application. Great.

Becky: How did that experience feel for you? Or, you know, you, you went through the whole gamut from starting on the contact us page to arriving on this page where, you know, you sort of have that confirmation on if you can increase your, your rating. How's that experience?

> P2: I thought it wasn't the most efficient to get there. Although sometimes I don't really mind that because I'm learning as I'm going through. I'm, I'm, I see other stuff.

> P2: So I call, I, I call it collateral learning, like I'm learning stuff as I'm going through, even if it's not directly related to what I'm looking for. I did, I'm figuring some other stuff out and seeing where other information is.

> P2: So it's not, it wasn't a bad thing and it didn't take me too long. It probably took me a little longer 'cause I'm here trying to talk about it as I'm doing it as opposed to just clicking through.

> P2: So I think there, you know, there might be an opportunity for a cleaner, you know, a link to increase your increase, your rating, although I think that would be inside my as I'm looking at my own personal record, there might be a a a little more smooth transition into applying for an increase or something like that.

> P2: But so I think it was a a little clunky because of the scenario, but I don't think it was bad. It didn't take me a lot longer than I would have hoped for.

Becky: And you know, I'm curious in in a more real world scenario where, well, in a, if you were just, you know, a veteran in this scenario, would you even start on the contact us page?

Becky: Or, you know, how would you begin the process to even learn about to answer your question

> P2: I, I would have gone to my own ratings page to look at what one to make sure is my shoulder, the shoulder that's rated, is it even in my record?

> P2: Because I just don't look at it often enough to be able to tell you what's in there necessarily.

> P2: So is it rated? What's it rated for? Is there even any increase available? I mean, I, I definitely know that there are maximum limits. And so I want to know, is it even something that's changeable?

> P2: So I would start there, look at what ratings I actually have before I went any further.

Becky: No, that that makes sense. Especially I'm assuming to you're, you're assuming you have the knowledge of VA.gov enough around its account process.

Becky: So you know what you might expect after you you log into your account too. Yeah, great.

Becky: So in, in this scenario, just to recap, it sounded like, you know, you started with the chat bot. You know, in the case that let's say the chat bot took you to the wrong article. And yeah, it it, it linked you to an article that didn't answer your question and you weren't able to land on this page. That sort of gives you the form to increase your, your rating.

Becky: What other channels would you try to go to, to go through to answer this question?

> P2: I might give the chat bot another chance because I know prompts really make a difference.

> P2: And so maybe change the way that I asked the question because I know it's going to take, if I put in a secure request, you know, that's going to take at least a day, depending on what day it is, which is super fast, you know, from my experience in the government, super fast and really like it.

> P2: But I know if I was looking for something, you know, quick response, I would go back to the, maybe go back to the chat bot.

> P2: And, and honestly, I would have used Reddit before to get a better, you know, or, or just generally search on Google 'cause there's a lot of other places besides Reddit, but that 1 is really good.

> P2: So I think I, yeah, I'll, I'll give the chat bot another try. And if that still didn't work, then I would put in a secure request.

Becky: OK, yeah, I'm curious too, have you had experience with other chat bots?

Becky: Is that sort of how you know that you need to prompt it with different prompts or is this like based solely on your experience with the VA chat bot?

> P2: Just others. Yeah, banks and credit cards and my last job in the military, we had tried some work with the chat bot that it needed the right prompt.

> P2: It's an understanding that it's only going to take what you give it. So, yeah, so and the VA's, II think, I don't know when the chat bot started with the VA, that I don't think it's been around that long.

> P2: And so I think it's [chatbot] great. And so I'm willing to use it if it's helpful to make it better. So I, I give it a try.

Becky: Yeah, awesome. That's helpful. It's helpful to know your your sort of background experience with some of these channels too.

Becky: Like you mentioned, the veteran population is very diverse. So you know, folks's experience can really vary. Yeah. All right.

Becky: Well, that does bring us to the end of the second scenario. So you can stop sharing your screen right now. And if you if you need help doing that, let me know. But OK, great.

## Review each scenario
Becky: And again, thank you for reviewing those scenarios with me. Your info has been super helpful.

Becky: And just before we end, I'm going to go ahead and share my own screen to review the different ways the Contact Us page could have helped in the login scenario.

Becky: And the purpose of this is just to give you a walkthrough for how VA.gov can help in the future, especially while we're still working on improving a lot of things like the Contact Us page, the chat bot messaging, etcetera.

Becky: So you definitely show me how finding these answers can be complicated and also simple in some scenarios, more complicated than others.

Becky: So this is just going to be a a quick walkthrough. So I will share my screen and pull up the right window right now. All right.

Becky: And I might not go through everything to sense you are familiar with secure the messaging through Ask VA and and chatbot, but also go through some other things.

[Becky does walk through. See this section in the conversation guide]

Becky: Do you have any questions or reactions to what I just reviewed with you?

### Explore our FAQs and other resources to get answers to your questions
> P2: A couple. Like I think that that answer that you found in this specific scenario seems like it's hidden.

> P2: Like I agree with what you're saying that that explains how to do it, but it's hit it's not really this is how you fix it.

> P2: This is like, you know, it explains that I think it would be hard to find scanning like you're saying the other one is.

### Contact your local VA facility
> P2: I know that there are and, and maybe it's because it's internal, the whole, I can't transfer you to this other place.

> P2: And so if there's a way to do a warm hand off, especially if it's, you know, it's I, I can't remember if you said if I called my local VA, if they were gonna do a warm hand off to somebody else or if they had to, if I had to dial another number that you'd have to do.

> P2: So it's a, it's a, it's, you have to dial another number. Yeah, it wouldn't be a hand off because, yeah, they just provide the number to call.

> P2: I hate that. I hate when I have to dial another number.

> P2: and I haven't had this, I have had this experience with the VA where I called the local and it was for a medical appointment.

> P2: They're like, hey, here's the new number like that. They're it's 10 feet next to you. Like I know where they're at. You can't transfer. The system doesn't allow you to transfer.

> P2: I think that that's a, you know, missing out and, and you drop people that way 'cause then they just get frustrated and don't call. So I think that that's, that's a that's a process that that could be improved.

> P2: But I know it's hard 'cause I know it's yeah, I if it's even possible. I don't even know, but yeah, that's it, right?

Becky: No, I mean, you know, I think it's it's our job to to make it happen. But you know, you're just even understanding that that is something that someone would want is, is helpful for us to know.

Becky: Like, you know, when you hang up the phone, you have to dial another number. It is just another point of friction and, and trying to get your answer.

> P2: I got my own phone number one time when I called and asked for Navy help, they gave me my, my, my desk phone number because I was listed as the point of contact to solve that problem.

> P2: I was the resolution and I didn't know the answer. So I know that it doesn't always work.

Becky: No, that that's, that's pretty funny.

> P2: Well, I didn't even catch it till I hung up and then I, I had already been on hold for like 30 minutes and finally got to it and then they gave me my own desk number. I go I got a call back.

Becky: So I think that's the challenge with phone numbers you or I mean contact support in general, you get stuck in a loop of of finding your answer.

Becky: I'm sorry that happened to you That's frustrating.

> P2: It's a good story though.

Becky: Yeah, I will, I'll stop sharing my screen real quick so that we can we can end end the session. But before that, I just wanted to spend some time reflecting before you finished.

## Cool down
Becky: And you know, we've already started sort of doing this, but I'm curious in general, what did you think of using the Contact Us page in both the account creation scenario and the claim scenario?

Becky: Is there anything you liked or anything you thought could have been easier? 

> P2: I'm going to scroll back to it if you don't mind me looking at it while we're talking.

> P2: Yeah, I, it's set up the way I would expect and the word contact us drives me to that.

> P2: It's, you know, contact us gives me enough information to get to that page if I'm looking for help. I think the way it's set up is probably the way I would look for help the, the kind of the, the structure that I would go.

> P2: And so that makes sense. I guess my, my really only feedback would be the, So the, the general information line having the helpful numbers above that or not above it.

> P2: I'm sorry, maybe below that like it's the general and then and then the other helpful numbers and then everything else below it.

> P2: Because if I just looked on here and called the VA health benefits hotline, but in the other helpful VA numbers, there's a more Direct Line for my question than now.

> P2: So moving that up a little bit could be helpful or even yeah, I think that would be more helpful my mine 84 one or my VA 411 and then other helpful numbers and then everything else below that.

> P2: Let's see what else I don't we we kind of talked about it that other that helpful online tools.

> P2: I don't see that as related to everything else. Those are kind of because I I could come up with 100 different helpful online tools. This is only four.

> P2: I don't really know how these are more helpful than than any of the other links.

> P2: And so maybe maybe it even if it just said, you know, top online tools or something like like these are the things that a lot of people come to and maybe that's what that is.

> P2: But I don't see the connection between everything else and that Gray box. Yeah, that's probably about that's about it on that page.

Becky: All right. Yeah, that's helpful to know. 

Becky: Yeah, we didn't really dive into that section as much, but it sounds like just what the like with the current heading and what's under there. It's not clear why it's even on the page maybe.

Becky: Is there anything else you wanted to share with me, just maybe about this, this research process or anything else with the session at all?

> P2: Can I can I ask a question maybe if you know when does the chat bot come out of beta? It seems like it's been in beta for two years

Becky: Yes You know, I have also been wondering that same question. I unfortunately do not have the answer, but oh, what what is interesting is that I know the chat bot team will be sitting in on some of these research sessions.

Becky: So I know they're you know, they're interested in continuing to improve the product and move it out of the beta phase.

Becky: But fortunately, I do not know when when that will be, but I'll relay the feedback that there definitely is interest in that because, you know, we're often not sure what what current usage if people are finding it helpful.

Becky: But it sounds like you are a frequent user of the chat box. I'm glad it's helping you.

> P2: And and I think like, like we were talking before, like it is a very diverse population.

> P2: And I think as time goes on, more and more people are going to use it because more and they're going to be more and more of a younger population, or at least those that are digitally, you know, digital natives, if you will.

> P2: And so there's going to be more of a need for that, more of a want for that, if there's not already. 

> P2: I would be surprised if it's not being used a lot. And and they know the limitations. Like I know that it can't do everything.

> P2: And I got it. And actually I learned today it could do more than I thought it could. So I would use it for other things too.

> P2: But yeah, I think it's a tool that a lot of people would use if it kind of gave us more functionality.

Becky: Yeah, absolutely. No, this is great feedback. Thank you.
