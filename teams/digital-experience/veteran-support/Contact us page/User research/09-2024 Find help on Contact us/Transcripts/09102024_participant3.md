## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
Becky: So first, just want to learn more about your experience with VA and VA customer support. So how long have you been a veteran?

> P3: I've been a veteran since [number], so [number] years.

Becky: Oh, OK, pretty long time. And then have you ever used the contact page on va.gov

> P3: As in contact?

Becky: Yeah, it's like Contact us on va.gov.

> P3: Yeah

Becky: Can you walk me through your most recent experience with using that page or, or even just, you know, maybe contacting VA customer support with a question or a concern?

> P3: Wow, that's been a while since I did just that. I the last time I was on VA.gov was looking for an actual contact for the [location].

> P3: So I did that for a friend who is a little unknown with the VA.gov page.

> P3: So, but it was easy. I mean, I just typed in the search.

Becky: So you just, it sounds like you just searched maybe did you search the facility name or like some keywords in the the top search bar?

> P3: I used [location], And then it pulled up, I think there's two clinics. It pulled up the two clinics that are closest to it.

Becky: Got it. And what sort of contact information were you looking for?

> P3: Patient advocacy

Becky: OK, like a phone number or like an e-mail or OK.

Becky: And is that when you're, I guess in this case you're looking up contact information for someone else? But in that case, were they looking for a phone number in particular or, you know, were they were there other methods you were looking for, but they just couldn't find?

> P3: They were looking just to contact patient advocacy. So I found the phone number and the contact e-mail for them.

Becky: And is, do you know if that's usually how they like to contact an organization or, or VA?

> P3: That was the first time they'd ever done that. For me, I personally have looked up the [location] VA for phone numbers, whether it's a the two clinics or if it's, you know, a specialty care if I have forgotten the phone number or hate sitting on the long phone call waiting to talk to somebody.

Becky: And you know, in that case too, do you ever try to find answers online first when you have a question? Or do you go straight to, OK, well, what do you do when you when you're trying to find answers?

> P3: Search bar is my favorite thing. So I will usually search it unless I know exactly where I'm going. And then sometimes even if I know where I'm going, it's easier to do the search bar because it's two clicks instead of me typing in this big long thing.

> P3: So like looking for the travel for BTSSS, typing in travel, you know it, it pulls up pretty close to going to straight to the page. So that's probably the most common thing I'd look up on there is the travel page.

Becky: Got it. Yeah. And are you usually able to find what you're looking for? And, you know, does it take a couple of searches before you get there? How are the results?

> P3: There's usually a couple, like I know which one it is now, But when I first started looking up travel, you would click on one and then like the page would just stop.

> P3: It would say redirecting, and then it just wouldn't do anything. And then the other one, go straight to the BTSS.

Becky: Ok. Well, well, thanks for walking through, you know, those multiple experiences with me. It sounds like you're trying to find answers. You really like search. And when you were helping your friend, you also used the search bar. So seems like that is your primary, primary way of finding contact information.

> P3: And I help fellow Veterans. So that's normally what I tell them when they ask me if they need to find something at the VA. I'm like just do the search, you know, go to VA.gov and search cause most of the time you can find the answer there.

> P3: And most of the time, you don't have to contact anybody because the answer's, you know, somebody else has already asked that question before. So it's in the search.

Becky: Yeah. And I guess the follow up question that that comes to me too. Are you mostly using search on VA.gov or do you ever use like search engines instead of that?

> P3: I used to use search engines, but you get so many crazy things that come back and then interesting, you know, your Facebook page shows up with this crazy stuff that you didn't even look up.

> P3: And so, yeah, I just normally go to VA.gov anymore.

Becky: Got it, got it. Yeah. To to avoid, I guess the the outlier result or that you don't really need.

Becky: OK, great. That totally makes sense. Thanks for explaining that. It's really helpful to learn about your experiences with VA.gov so far. Great.

## Scenarios
Becky: So next in in the section, I'm going to give you two scenarios where you as a veteran would reach out to VA for help.

Becky: And these are actually real questions that veterans asked us this year. So they've just been rewarded. And before I do that, I'm gonna send you a link to our current Contact us page on va.gov. So let me know if you need help finding the chat, but I'm going to send you it in the chat right now.

Becky: All right, if I can get the chat to load for myself as well. There we go.

> P3: OK, I'm on there.

Becky: All right. And have you ever shared your screen on Zoom before?

> P3: Yes. You mean just to try and remember how to do it? I'm more used to Teams.

Becky: So that is what everyone has been saying.

> P3: Yeah.

Becky: But yeah, well, I can see your screen now, so that's perfect. All right, so I'll give you your first scenario now. Again, we'll review 2 scenarios in total this session.

### Login scenario
Becky: So in this scenario, you're a veteran and you can't create an account on VA.gov. You're trying to create a login.gov account, but login.gov doesn't let you use your passport as a form of identification, and you don't have your driver's license right now because you lost it recently. So you only have your passport.

Becky: OK, starting on this page, show me how you'd find help for this scenario. And as you're showing me, tell me what you're thinking and noticing too. 

Becky: Grace, I see you're, you're scrolling down the page, are you, What are you skimming for right now?

> P3: Right now I'm skimming for a contact for online support.

Becky: OK.

> P3: And the closest thing I see is the my healthy my health vet help desk. OK, Or I could let's see. OK, I would go with this one here. The contact us through Ask VA.

> P3: I kind of skimmed over that one quickly on the way down, so I would click on that.

Becky: OK, well, what do you think contact us online means? 

> P3: Usually it's a chat chat. OK, a chat or frequently asked questions.

Becky: Got it. And what would you do when you arrived on this page?

> P3: I would hit start your message without signing in because I don't have a sign in.

Becky: All right, great. Yeah, you can go back to the the contact us page now and maybe we can pause a bit. So I'm curious why you chose this method versus all of the other things you're seeing on the page just because, well, number one, it's at the top.

> P3: OK, so you know, a lot of people don't scroll as far as I do. So starting at the top, that would be the first place I would go.

> P3: Chat bots are not my favorite thing. So I'd much rather wait for an e-mail to come back and calling us is well, it's the VA.

> P3: So it's ridiculous to call the VA unless you have like half a day.

> P3: OK and my local VA I would just it would probably be just as fast to do the ask VA.

Becky: Got it. I'm curious on why you would not choose the chat bot or you mentioned it's not your favorite thing, why is that?

> P3: Normally it's like a bunch of different responses to get to 1 simple thing. So it gets frustrating sometimes with the chat box chat box because they pick up keywords and sometimes when you're wording things, it doesn't quite come out.

> P3: Chat box body, you know, we tend to add fillers and so you get the wrong answers a lot of times and you have to keep asking in different ways.

Becky: Got it. Have you ever used the VA chat box before? I'm curious.

> P3: No

Becky: So this is just based on like past experience with other chatbots. OK, yeah, I'm I'm curious also why you don't choose to contact your local VA facility in the scenario too.

> P3: Again, the the, the wait to even talk to a person if you don't have an exact extension to call, you sit on there for a while and wait and wait and wait and then somebody answers and then they send you to hopefully the right place and use it and wait and wait and wait until somebody answers that call too.

> P3: So time it take to me, in my experience, it takes too long to contact a an actual person at my local VA.

> P3: I'm a big secure message person because I don't want to sit there and wait and listen to the Garry Sensei voice over and over and over the advertisement.

Becky: Got it. No, that makes a lot of sense because I was just going, I was thinking, you know, with when you send a message through contact us online through Ask VA, you're you're still waiting, but not waiting right there on on the line.

> P3: Yeah, I can go do something and wait for the e-mail to come back.

Becky: Got it. Ok. And have you used this contact method before, the Ask VA tool?

> P3: No

Becky: OK, so this is just, you know, based on what you're reading here, it sounds like it's it could be something you could use or use be useful to you.

> P3: Yeah.

Becky: And what kind of response would you expect from VA with this option?

> P3: I would hope to have a response within 24 hours.

> P3: OK, 'cause I wouldn't even go here if, if it was something I need an answer to, like right this moment, within the next couple hours, I would probably get on the phone and wait.

Becky: OK, I see. So it sounds like the urgency of an an answer would help you decide which which thing to choose.

> P3: Yeah.

Becky: Got it. yeah. What's the scenario in which you you might need more urgent help and and if so, you know what, what phone number might you call for that based on what's on this page right now

> P3: Scenario, I need an appointment and can't wait for, you know, the few days it takes when you do go online to schedule an appointment. I would call my local VA for that.

> P3: If there was a problem with my pay, I would again type in the search and look for a payment or I don't even know what I would look for.

> P3: But yeah, I would do a search and then contact a phone number it pulled up.

Becky: Ok. So you would try to find a phone number through the search option too. OK, Yeah, if you so you mentioned, shoot, a question around, I think it was around making an appointment. Do you think you'd be able to find a phone number on this page? If you if you took a look at just the the different phone numbers there

> P3: It wouldn't be right here on this page, but I could click contact your local VA facility.

Becky: OK, Yeah. Do you wanna just go through that whole process again? Since this is a live page, you can you can totally interact with it.

Becky: All right, so it looks like you're just using autofill to put in your address and you're just selecting the facility type.

Becky: Is there any reason why you're selecting VA Health versus the other options in that drop down?

> P3: Well, because we were talking about appointments and I went with the fact that it wasn't an emergency, it wasn't something urgent, it was just I needed to find somebody to take care of health needs.

Becky: OK, makes sense.

> P3: You know, benefits doesn't help with, you know, appointments, Cemeteries doesn't help and Vet Centers I'm not quite familiar with 'cause there's not one near me.

> P3: So I couldn't tell you if they could help with appointments. So, but I would, and this is kind of funny because I just found there's a new clinic. It's actually closer than the one I've been going to.

Becky: Yeah. I mean, in that case, how would you, how would you choose which one to go to for me?

> P3: As you can see, they're all, you know, 45 minutes to an hour and a half away from me. So first look and see.

> P3: OK, Well, [location] is .4 miles close, closer than [location], but my main care is at [location]. So I would go there first just because that's where my main care is already.

Becky: OK.

> P3: And they're a bigger, they're a bigger Medical Center. You know, it's not a clinic, it's a hospital and everything.

Becky: Got it. No, that that makes sense, your reasoning there? What would you do next to, to contact the Medical Center?

> P3: I'd call that number, the main number.

Becky: OK, great. Yeah. And, and the reason why I ask is just, you know, there are a lot of different links you can click on in these search results. So it sounds like you would just stop on this page and and call the number.

Becky: And would you call immediately or, you know, save the number for later to call?

> P3: I would call immediately because if I'm on here looking for it, you know, I, I want answers now. So yeah, I would call immediately and then save it in my phone, of course, so that I had it next time and didn't have to search for it again.

Becky: Yeah great. No, that that totally makes sense that you would, you know, save it since you already did the whole search.

Becky: So you could just look it up in another way. Yeah, right. Let let's go back to the contact us page. If you scroll the OR you can just press the back button too that that also works.

Becky: Awesome. All right, so again, we, we sort of switched gears, but going back to the first scenario, which was you can't create an account on va.gov because you only have your passport and login.gov doesn't accept that as a form of ID.

Becky: So you mentioned you would contact VA through Ask VA, but I'm curious, you know, let's say that they provide an answer that doesn't really help. What would you do next in this case? If you still needed an answer.

> P3: I would explore the frequently asked questions and other resources. OK, Personally, I again, I stay away from chat bots because they end up frustrating me.
 
> P3: So I would definitely, you know, skip down to the frequently asked questions, right?

Becky: Yeah. Can you show me how you might might use that?

> P3: I'll try...

Becky: So you're just clicking the link to get through there. And it sounds like you're just searching keywords.

Becky: Is there any reason why you chose login.gov as a keyword versus any other keywords or is that just the first thing that came to mind for you?

> P3: That's the first thing that came to mind to me. If I'm looking to get a login.gov, I might as well start with that as the basic information and then I can go through these answers and stuff.

> P3: OK, so you know, I could scroll and I'm not I would, this would be the first I'm pointing at it, sorry.

> P3: This one here would be the first one I would go to because, you know, I have an appointment at the VA in two days, so I might as well see if they can do it there at the VA.

> P3: So why not do this additional thing if you're going there anyway?

Becky: Yeah, ok.

> P3: I'm all about trying to save time, So if I can do three things at one time, I'm going to go ahead and do that.

Becky: Yes. Efficiency.

> P3: And I'm noticing here it says that you can go to the the post office, which I did not know.

Becky: Yeah.

> P3: Which I have an ID.gov account.

Becky: Oh yes, the other one. Yeah. So in this case, would you, you know, would that be enough information for you or would you, you know, select other pages or or continue reading?

> P3: I would probably again, depend on the scenario that I'm in at the time. You know, that answered my question. I can go to the the post office.

> P3: So I'm gonna go ahead. I'll click on it to find out what I need to take to the post office and if they will take the passport. If not, then I would contact my contact the VA.

> P3: So I don't know.

Becky: All right, so you're clicking to get more information it seems like. OK, OK.

> P3: And then I click on that, I click on that link For more information because it's not telling me if it took if it takes the passport. And then because I don't have my ID, I would click on this link that says don't have a state issued ID to see what else I could bring.

> P3: OK, Yeah, let's see. And it does not take any of them. It does not take your passport.

Becky: Got it.

> P3: So then I would have to get on the phone.

Becky: Ok. So at this point, you know, is there any reason why you've decided to get on the phone at this point versus, you know, earlier on in the process.

> P3: I clicked four different links.

Becky: Yeah.

> P3: So once four different links and I didn't get the answer. So on much other call and verbally speak with somebody who can answer my question.

Becky: Yeah, absolutely that that totally makes sense. And going again, thinking back to the contact us page, so there was a there's a link to different FAQs and other resources.

Becky: Would you expect to see this type of this type of link or support on contact us on that page as in and and sorry you you are on the login.gov page.

Becky: So that's why it just looks a bit different. 

Becky: I guess I'm just wondering, you know, as opposed to a phone number or like the Ask VA option, would you expect to see links to FAQ articles on the Contact Us page or would you expect to see that somewhere else?

> P3: I'd expect to see it on the FAQ link that's on the Contact Us page.

Becky: And so on the Contact Us page and if you scroll all the way to the top, oh wait, you're on right now. If you go down to the FAQ section again, I'm curious what you think the words resources and support means. Like what, what do you think? What do you think you're going to get out of resources and support?

> P3: Resources would be other resources that are not affiliated with the VA, but the VA, you know, puts them out there because they're they're real and legit resources.

> P3: And then there's, I see the step by step guides, but I don't know what that would be.

Becky: Now what do you think support might mean?

> P3: Support would, I would hope would be, you know, an actual person. Either an actual person or, or an e-mail, you know, kind of like we were talking about at the, the other part of it, you know, send an e-mail to where I can get an answer that way.

Becky: Got it. Yeah. So it sounds like resources to you means outside the resources support might mean talking to a way to connect with an actual person, actual person at the VA.

Becky: OK, great. No, that makes that makes full sense. I'm going to move us along to our next scenario. So we'll, you know, I'll repeat some of these same questions again, But if you want, you can just or if you could, you can scroll to the top of this page since we'll also be looking at the contact us page.

### Claims scenario
Bekcy: And now I'll go over the second scenario. Let me scroll back up and my guide. All right, so this is our 2nd and final scenario.

Becky: Again, you're imagine you're a veteran and you are a veteran, but in this case, you currently get disability compensation for shoulder pain. But you've noticed your shoulder has been hurting more in the past couple of months and you want to know if you can request more compensation for your shoulder pain because it's feeling a bit worse now.

Becky: So again, starting on this page, show me and and walk me through how you would find help for this new scenario.

> P3: Oh, there's the VA benefits hotline number. And if the scenario were after 9:00 PM Eastern Time and before 8 AM, I would I would click on check your VA claim or appeal status, because if I click on that, I should be able to find a phone number or an e-mail.

> P3: I would hope that I could ask the question.

Becky: OK, Yeah, you can go ahead and click on that and question while the page is loading. 

Becky: Are you, is there a reason why you would try to find a, a phone number on this page rather than just calling the benefits hotline number that you pointed out earlier?

> P3: Well, that would only be if it was not within the hours that they're open. If they, if they open, I would call them.

> P3: But on here, I would try and find if, if I had to sign in, I would click on that [sign-in button] and find either a contact e-mail or some way of sending them a message that they, you know, would get before.

> P3: Sorry there's a bee.

Becky: Oh no, I do see it too.

> P3: Anyway, I would send them a message and you know, that way there's a lot of Veterans.

> P3: We forget [stuff] sorry, excuse my language, we forget stuff.

> P3: And so a lot of times 3:00 in the morning, I'm going to write an e-mail because by 7-8 o'clock the next day, I'm going to forget it.

Becky: got it. And I've noticed you're a a big scroller. So what what type of information are you looking for on this page right now as you're scrolling down?

> P3: I'm looking for an e-mail because I don't, do I have a sign in in this scenario or no?

Becky: No, not at this, I did not prepare a sign-in for you, so no, you don't have one.

> P3: I was just asking. In this scenario, would I have a sign-in?

Becky: Oh I see what you're asking. Yes, you would be able to log into your account

> P3: So I could, I I like to read, which is why I scroll a lot, so.

Becky. No worries.

> P3: Yeah, I could click on this claim status, frequently asked questions and see if there's anything about adding to my claim if you know, there's a step by step.

Becky: Ok. And is there any reason why you'd choose that link rather than any of the others?

> P3: Well, this one is the, this one is the decision review and appeal status. And I'm not waiting for a decision. I'm not waiting for an appeal.

> P3: I want to see about doing an appeal so frequently asked questions again, you know, if I've gotten this far, it's in the middle of the night, so I'm still looking for answers.

> P3: So I would look on the frequently asked questions because there's nobody to talk to right now.

Becky: OK, and why did you, I guess going back to the again to the contact us page, if you could press the back button real quick.

Becky: I noticed that, you know, you're scrolling down, but you stopped in the phone number section.

Becky: Is there any particular reason why you would in this case go to the phone number rather than, you know, the other options that we've seen on this page so far?

> P3: 'cause it's your benefits, it's, you know, your monthly payments. So, you know, most veterans are like, OK, this is my money and I I want to know now.

> P3: So, so yeah, I would go to the phone number first and, you know, the hours are on there and if they're open, I'm going to call the number and see how long the wait is.

Becky: Got it. And I'm curious if the what the words in bold there, if that's enough to explain what, what you might expect on the other end of the call.

> P3: Yes

Becky: Ok. Are you familiar with the VA benefits hotline at all or are you just reading it for for the first time here?

> P3: I'm just reading it for the first time here. I did everything for mine in person.

Becky: OK great

> P3: VA.gov was not that good back then, 14 years ago.

Becky: That, that's great to hear or well, not great to hear, but good to know that we've we've improved there.

Becky: All right, So you know, let's say you, you do call, but you still don't quite get the answer you need.

Becky: And again, the scenario is you have worsening shoulder pain and you just want to know if you can increase your disability compensation.

Becky: What would you do, you know, if that first phone number didn't work out now?

> P3: Well, there is the VA health benefits hotline. It's gonna be a secondary phone number to call.

Becky: Got it. 

> P3: And then you can always go to the frequently asked questions to see if they can give you kind of a broad spectrum answer.

Becky: Yeah. So you can you can go ahead and and click into the FA QS if if that's something you would do in this case.

> P3: And now I'm looking at the different topics to make sure I don't need to type in anything.

Becky: Yeah ok. So before, you know, you just went to the search and now you're sort of scrolling down and looking at the topic. Ok.

> P3: And I'm not seeing anything in the decision reviews and appeals. I would click on the disability articles.

Becky: OK, so you're clicking the link to see all the articles because maybe you're not seeing it on that first page.

> P3: Yeah.

Becky: OK.

> P3: And then I'd scroll just a little bit. If it's not at the top, then I would go ahead and type in. This isn't review. Not just isn't review, words are not working with anyone.

Becky: Yeah, no worries. To remind you of the scenario, It's worsening shoulder pain. You want to know if you can increase your disability compensation.

Becky: All right, so it sounds like it looks like you're searching. OK, And what would you do now?

> P3: Now, I would again, scroll just a little bit. There's only three answers there and none of them answer that question.

> P3: OK, So I would go back and as I'm going back, go ahead and look and see if I missed something I could have.

Becky: All right. So, yeah, so it looks like, you know, maybe going through the FAQs didn't help in this case.

Becky: So, yeah, as as a final, final resort... what was that? Sorry, could you repeat that?

> P3: I said I would call.

Becky: Yeah, great. Well, that makes sense. Thanks for thanks for walking through that scenario around increasing disability compensation.

Becky: All right, well, we're finished with each scenario now, so you can stop sharing your screen and it should just be like a button at the top.

## Review each scenario
Becky: OK, thank you. So thank you for again reviewing those with me. Your input's been really helpful.

Becky: And before we end, I'm gonna go ahead and share my screen just to show you the different ways that the Contact Us page could have helped in one of those scenarios.

Becky: So we'll take a look at the Login one. And I'm hoping this walkthrough shows you how to use va.gov for help in the future, especially while we're still working on improving the Contact Us page and you know, other sections on VA.gov.

Becky: So you've definitely shown me how finding these answers can be complicated for veterans right now. But again, we're hoping to make that a little bit better in the future.

Becky: OK, so I will share my screen.

[Becky does walk through. See this section in the conversation guide]

Becky: Do you have any questions or I'm curious too if you have any reactions to anything I just showed you.

### Explore our FAQs and other resources to get answers to your questions
> P3: Keywords are definitely important when you do a certain because I would have had to enter more keywords to actually find that answer.

> P3: And it it's kind of odd to me that login.gov and ID me both have two different verification processes.

> P3: So it kind of makes me want to do a login.gov because they're a little bit more strict on what ID they take.

Becky: Oh, OK.

> P3: 'cause, you know, I thought ID me was pretty safe and then here they had so many more ways to verify, which is good if you can't find anything but your passport, but it's not good if you, I mean, it seems like it would be a lot easier to break into that situation there.

> P3: So that was kind of different to find out.

Becky: Got it. Yeah, that's definitely interesting. You're looking from, I think the the like the safety perspective of it

> P3: Yeah, the security of it.

Becky: Yeah. Anything else that that stood out to you in that walkthrough? Like you mentioned keywords.

### Ask our chatbot a question

> P3: No, not really. I mean, if you're a chat bot person, I'm glad that it's it's there.

> P3: And I do like the fact that it did it, you know, it was pretty smooth and asking you questions. And then, you know, when it couldn't answer it specifically, it sent you, you know, contact information.

> P3: It didn't ask you crazy questions. But it wasn't, you know, taking 50 steps to find out that it didn't know the answer.
 
> P3: You know, you know, it's just a couple steps. It was like, OK, you need a real person.

Becky: Right, yeah, you could, it escalated to a real person when it knew it couldn't answer your question quickly.

Becky: OK, well, I'll stop sharing my screen here and we'll just take some time to close out the session and and cool down.

## Cool down
Becky: So I'd like to spend a little time just reflecting before we finish. And we already started doing this a little bit, but in general, what did you think of using the contact us page in those both of those scenarios?

Becky: Is there anything you liked or anything that you think could have been easier?

> P3: I like the fact it was easy to find the phone numbers, whatever you're looking for, you know, whether it's your, you know, VA health or benefits and so forth.

> P3: I like that, that it was split up where it's not one general number to call.

> P3: Where you know, you call this person who has health and benefits and burial and all that all at one phone number. I like the fact split up with different phone numbers.

> P3: I know way back in the dinosaur age there was one phone number and you could be on there for days.

Becky: OK, got it. Sounds like you you're expecting a maybe a longer wait time or a longer time to get to the person you need to get to if there's just one phone number, maybe.

> P3: Definitely

Becky: OK. Is there anything that that could have been a bit easier in using the page for me?

> P3: For me, no. Other veterans who aren't so tech savvy. I'm not saying I am because I'm definitely far from it, but I know there's people out there that are worse than I am.

> P3: It might be a little bit difficult, but it it is broken up a little bit easier than it used to be to find information.

> P3: It instead of hitting contact us at the very bottom and then click in another one and then again the the one phone number to call.

> P3: It's, it's definitely easier because it's split up, you know, and also there's more information there than just a phone number.

> P3: So you click on a link and you know, it could take you to benefits or it could take you to appointments instead of just, OK, here's the phone number, go to it.

> P3: You know, for people, again like me, who don't like to sit on the phone for very long, you know, being able to click and get to where you need to go is it's a blessing.

Becky: Got it. Yeah, I noticed, you know, you like clicking around and you're very comfortable. I think you're quite tech savvy. You're comfortable navigating to tell their pages. I definitely saw that too.

Becky: Well, that was, that was the the last question there or sorry, another question, but just is there anything you want to share with me about this research process or, or anything like that before we close out?

> P3: I'm loving you guys doing this, this research process. I've done a couple of of them and I know that has definitely improved a lot since the first time it was, you know, put out there.

> P3: So I like the fact that you're asking Veterans questions and you're trying to find out what's easiest for us and what we, you know, what our opinions is on these sites because we're the ones that use them.

> P3: So instead of, you know, just somebody sitting there coming up with this program and, you know, we're sitting there going, where did you come up with this?

> P3: You know, and again, you know, us being the Veteran, we're the ones asking the questions, you know, we're the ones that need the answers.

> P3: So you guys make it easier for us to find those answers is a great benefit.

Becky: Yeah. I'm glad, you know, you've been doing the research sessions. And I do agree that, you know, we don't, we don't want to make assumptions on how someone might use something.

Becky: So, you know, even just you today walking me through how you'd use the contact us page gave us a lot of insight into how we can make it better. I definitely have some ideas.

> P3: OK, good.

Becky: Yeah. All right. Well, Parigean will send you a thank you note with some information you can pass along to other veterans if they'd like to participate in future research sessions.

Becky: But, yeah, thank you for sharing some time with me today.

> P3: All right.

Becky: I hope you have a lovely rest of your day.

> P3: Thank you.
