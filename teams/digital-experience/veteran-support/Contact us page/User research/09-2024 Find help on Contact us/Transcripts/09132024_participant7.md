## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
Becky: And first, I'd like to begin just learning more about your experience with VA and VA customer support. So around how long have you been a veteran?

> P7: Well, I joined the military in [number] and so I really started using the VA probably back in about [number].

> P7: So and, and then as as I progressed, I, I got more and more involved in using My HealtheVet and and that type of thing using more and more of the, the services and technology that was available.

Becky: Awesome. Yeah. And in your, in your experience using those services, have you ever used the Contact us page on VA.gov in particular?

> P7: I don't recall.

Becky: OK.

> P7: I, I do use secure messaging. So I I'm in contact with my providers quite frequently with the secure messaging, but I'm not aware of the contact us or whatever you just said page on va.gov.

Becky: Yeah, yeah. So 2 follow up questions that are coming to mind for you, but I'll ask one first. Can you walk me through maybe your most recent experience just reaching out to VA around any help you needed? Like you mentioned secure messaging, what that was like?

[P7 talks about most recent experience with VA secure messaging]

Becky: Got it.

[P7 talks more about health experience]

Becky: So I noticed you talked a lot about your health benefits and so I'm, I'm assuming here, but I want to confirm, did you do all this through secure messaging like this back and forth through VA or was it also through a phone call or e-mail, anything like that?

> P7: The email's pretty much the, the secure messaging with, with VA, I also use, and we'll call it MyChart. It's not, it's not my chart with, with the civilian Dr.

> P7: So and then trying to go between the two, it seems like, yeah, it is my chart. It seems like at one time the civilian doctors and the VA was able to see each other's notes or, or whatever, you know, but that's not always the case and usually it's not.

> P7: So that would be very beneficial if the doctors inside the VA and outside the VA had more communication and access to my [records.]

[P7 talks about specific health story]

Becky: So sounds like a lot of messaging and but you're saying there there wasn't a lot of communication between the civilian provider and the VA provider there?

> P7: Not at all. I'm the link.

[P7 talks about specific health story]

Becky: So you, it sounds like you're you're relying on your memory for a lot of these things.

> P7: Well, not only memory, but as far As for, you know, and dealing with the VA, as far as can't think of the term, but there's no proof that that actually happened, you know?

Becky: Oh, the evidence.

> P7: Right. There's no record of it.

Becky: Got it. Yeah. I feel like, you know, your experiences might align with one of the scenarios we'll, we'll go through today.

## Scenarios
Becky: So the next part of the session is just, I'll give you 2 scenarios where you as a veteran would reach out to VA for help. And these scenarios are actually real questions that veterans have asked us this year. Just reworded.

[Becky shares link to Contact us page. P7 screen shares]

### Claims scenario
Becky: All right, so I'll give you your first scenario now and all right, so you're on the first scenario, first scenario.

Becky: So imagine you're a veteran who currently gets disability compensation for shoulder pain, and you notice your shoulder has been hurting more in the past couple of months. But you don't know if you can request more compensation for your shoulder pain because it's worse now.

Becky: So you want to know if you can request more compensation. Starting on this page, show me how you would find help for this scenario. And as you're showing me, tell me what you're thinking and noticing too.

> P7: OK, Yeah, let's say yeah...

Becky: Yes, I see you, you may stopped on, sorry and I might interject just to ask what you're thinking, But I see you stopped on the contact us online through Ask VA. That first section. What were you doing there?

> P7: I was reading what options I had to click on to see what might be most appropriate for my question.

Becky: I see you're scrolling down now.

> P7: Yeah, "Your VA benefits and services...", but this really isn't a link. I mean that this is more information [description text under Explore our FAQs... section].

> P7: I'm wanting to contact somebody. Check your claim, or appeal. Nope. Schedule manage... Nope. Let me go back up.

> P7: I think I would call the VA benefits hotline. I think that would be I would prefer to talk to somebody and say, hey, here's my problem. Where do I need to go?

> P7: Because I know from past experience, I can click on this stuff here on Contact us, on this page.

> P7: Well, here's a call, was call, was would be the same as the other thing. I could click on that and call somebody and talk to somebody and say, hey, where do I go from here?

> P7: Here's my question rather than because I know a lot of times if I click on these links, I end up in a rabbit hole and three hours later I'm like hell in the heck did I end up here. You know, forget what I'm even looking for, you know.

> P7: So unless it specifically says, you know, how do I, you know, request more compensation? So it's not really giving me the the question I'm looking for.

> P7: I mean, I, you know, you contact us online via ask VA was basically the same thing as calling somebody and talking to them, except I'm typing rather than, and I may or may not actually talk to somebody.

> P7: If I'm typing online, I may be talking with a, a robot and, you know, so you you just don't know.

Becky: I want to go back to one thing you mentioned. And so you know, you were scrolling down the page and I wanted to confirm, were you looking specifically for like keywords related to the scenario like compensation or increase things like that?

> P7: Yes.

Becky: OK. Got it, yeah. And it sounded like you didn't see those.

> P7: Well, it just the VA website, I get extremely, extremely frustrated trying to use it because even like the search, if, if there's ever a search box and I put in VA compensation and it will give me stuff that's not even close to what I'm asking for, you know, it'll talk about or allowance or, you know, crazy stuff.

> P7: And so I'm, I found it's better off to try to talk to somebody if, if you can, whether it's verbally over the phone or chat personally with somebody.

> P7: Again, a lot of times anymore, if even even trying to talk to somebody or chat with somebody, you got this whole layer of, you know, press 1, press 2, you know, and sometimes you may think you're actually talking to somebody and it's like, no, this is a robot, you know, so it's, it's frustrating.

Becky: Exactly. No, I definitely hear you. It's quite clear why you would choose to call first. And I'm curious, you know, when you went down to that section, there were a bunch of phone numbers listed.

Becky: So how did you, what's your thought process to choose that specific one that you would call?

> P7: Well, on Call us, there's a main information line, but there, it's kind of like a clearing height house guy. You don't know, you know, it's not specific enough.

> P7: Telecommission kind of TTTYI think that's I don't know. I think that's for hard of hearing or something. I don't know what that is. But anyway, I don't think it fits.

> P7: VA benefits hotline. That's an that's an option. That would be a good option.

> P7: The GI Bill hotline, nah. That's not going to work for my question here.

> P7: National call Center for homeless. Nope, that's not it.

> P7: Benefits hotline [pointing to VA health benefits hotline]. That sounds more specific as to what I'm looking for.

> P7: The healthy vet. That's more if you're having trouble with accessing this whole, my healthy vet program like technical problems, not so much the other thing.

> P7: And there's a full list of numbers and that's a rabbit hole that sometimes I was here just in the last month. Who was I calling or what was I calling about? It was about community care.

[P7 discusses health experience.]

> P7: [About community care experience] And no matter what I did, I ended up getting a recording or, or whatever. So I left a message, said here's the situation, here's my name, here's my contact information. Never heard anything back.

> P7: Eventually I end up going to a general telephone list, say at VA hospital, clicked on community care, called that number, left a message.

> P7: Couple weeks later after this is all over, I get a a telephone call from somebody called [name].

> P7: I had no idea who [name] was trying to tell her what's going on. It's like, I don't know who you are, [name], but are you from, you know, a doctor's office, community care, whatever.

[P7 continues discussing health experience.]

Becky: Well, I was just gonna ask you as a follow up. Right now we're on the contact us page, but it doesn't necessarily have, you know, all of the phone numbers that you mentioned.

Becky: So how did you go about finding that contact information like the the [location] office you mentioned and all those other contact information?

> P7: I probably got frustrated with the VA.gov site, went out to like Google and googled [location] VA hospital phone list or or whatever.

> P7: And then I would find a VA.gov website to click on and show me a list of phone numbers.

> P7: And found usually when I do that or even when if I do it within the va.gov, I'm looking for a specific doctor or let's say I'm looking for orthopaedic surgery.

> P7: Well, orthopaedic surgery is not there, you know, or if I'm looking for community care, it, it may or may not be listed.

> P7: It it never 90 some percent of the time if I'm looking for something on the site, I can't find it.

> P7: And if I do the search thing, type in community care, like I said, it'll give me stuff that's not even related to what my question is. Very frustrating.

Becky: Got it. Yeah. You mentioned, you know, going down the rabbit hole, clicking links, not being able to find anything and keyword searches, maybe not using the right ones to to pull up the right information. So that makes sense to me.

Becky: Yeah. To wrap up the scenario, I want to ask you a final question. And so let's say you try calling the benefits hotline number.

Becky: It doesn't give you the answer you need. And again, the scenario is you just want to ask, can I increase my disability compensation for a worsening condition, my shoulder pain? And you don't quite get the answer you need. What would you do next?

> P7: In this case, what I have found the best thing to do, and I've very rarely had to do it, was go to the, I forget the term for the guy, the [location] Department of Veteran Affairs representative, and that guy will know the answers.

> P7: He'll know, how do I want to say it? He'll know that nitty gritty of, it says this. But if you do this, you can, you can get there. You know, so or you know, don't even. I know it says that, but don't even mess with that. You'll never, it'll never work.

> P7: I don't use them very often, but that is kind of the last resort. It's local. It's within 15 minutes of my house. I could drive to their office.

> P7: I can do a walk in like I say, I've I've probably used them in the last [number] years four times, you know, and, and in those four times, it was always a compensation question, disability and compensation. Yeah. So that's the last resort for me.

Becky: Yeah, yeah. That's, you know, you know, exactly the, the person you're reaching out to and they have all the answers. And, you know, I even see that's not an option on this page.

Becky: So it seems like you've, you've found that on your own and your own experience.

> P7: Yeah.

Becky: Yeah. 

> P7: Well, right here, right here below the phone list is Contact your local VA facility. And I don't know if that would go into the [location], you know, if that's all the the federal government stuff or if it refers you to well, there talks about regional office cemetery.

> P7: Yeah, I need a cemetery about now. Local VA health facilities, excuse me, which there's really none that close to me, but OK.

Becky: Yeah. So seems like that that caught your attention after we're talking about maybe contacting a more local contact.

> P7: Yes.

Becky: Yeah. Well, again, that was my my final question for the scenario. I have a lot of good insights. So for our next one, you can just, yeah, scroll all the way to the top and we'll sort of reset and imagine, you know, we're starting on this page again. Yeah.

### Login scenario
Becky: So again, you're a veteran, and this time you're having trouble creating an account on VA.gov. So what you're trying to do is you're trying to create a login.gov account because there are, you know, multiple options you can choose from.

Becky: But login.gov is not letting you use your passport to verify your identity. And you don't have your driver's license because unfortunately, you lost it recently. But you know, you really need to make an account now starting on this page.

Becky: Let me know or tell me how you would find help for this scenario. And again, as you're showing me, tell me what you're thinking and what stands out to you too.

> P7: Well, because I'm now a little bit more familiar with this page, I'm looking at a technical issue as far as the website.

> P7: So I would go down to, to, to, to, to, to my healthy vet help desk and reach out to them and say, hey, I need to log on, I need to set up an account or whatever. Can you help me?

Becky: Yeah. What's drawing you to that phone number versus the others?

> P7: The my healthy vet help desk should be able to help me with this technical question. And if not, I'm, I'm hoping that they would refer me to who I, who I need to, to set up this account. 

Becky: Yeah. And let me know if this sounds right too, But it sounds like the term help desk makes you think of help regarding specifically technical issues. Is that right?

> P7: In this, in this particular case, yes, because I'm familiar with my healthy vet. Is this program, you know, so it's, it's the program and we're trying to set up an account.

> P7: It may not be specifically the my healthy vet program. I'm trying to set up an account, but that's that's a good seems logical that that's a good place to start.

Becky: Got it. And I'm curious what, what sort of response are you expecting when you call this number?

> P7: Well, expecting versus what I, you know, I, I, I know that I may call that and, and it's like I'm, I need apples and they're selling oranges and, and, but hopefully they can refer me to the, the apple cart rather than the orange.

> P7: And anyway, so I'm, I'm just reaching out to hopefully talk to a person and, and get some guidance on where I need to go. If if they're not the, the person to talk to.

Becky: Got it. Yeah, So sort of same, same follow up question with the previous scenario, but let's say you call and they they don't have an answer, they can't even redirect you to the orange cart. And so you know, what do you do next in this scenario?

> P7: OK, well I'd probably look at what's what else is available and I might look at frequently asked questions to see if anybody else has had that problem and if there's an answer there.

> P7: Again, it seems like that potentially would take more time 'cause usually when you when I look for frequently asked questions, the question I'm looking for isn't there.

> P7: And you know, probably in this case Local VA facility isn't gonna help.

> P7: Call us again. Would be like contacting the My HealtheVet. It's kind of a hit hit or miss kind of deal, but it'd be worth a try.

> P7: Contact us online through ask VA. That's potential. But you know, all these are...

> P7: Chat bot, a question I haven't had really... in this one here, setting up an account with login logon.gov, chat bot might be able to work.

> P7: But you know, I, I might just start at the top and work my way down because there's nothing that really jumps out and says this is who I need to, to contact.

> P7: So after, you know, like I say, after the first one that, you know, thinking this is a program issue and, and My HealtheVet help desk and, and again, what your, your scenario VA log on dot Gov.

> P7: I don't know if my healthy vet at VA log on dot Gov. They're probably separate entities. You know, again, I might be addressing the wrong areas there, but hopefully, you know, they might be able to help me out.

Becky: No, yeah, that's, that's definitely helpful to hear. So it sounds like a couple things. None of those other options are really sticking out to you. So maybe just you know, go through the list and it sounds like, and again, let me know if this sounds right, but it sounds like you, you are similar to the first scenario looking for that keyword of anything related to login.gov or account issues or anything like that.

> P7: Yeah, you you said I'm looking to set up create an account on VA logon.com and I don't even know if this is the VA logon.com page that we're talking about. Hopefully if I knew more about why I was looking at log on dot Gov, it would, it would help me funnel in what I'm I'm looking for.

> P7: But if somebody just says your information you need is on VA log on dot Gov, set up an account and go from there. And I'm then I'm trying to figure that out.

> P7: Yeah, I'm just, I'm just looking for anything. And, and log on dot Gov. I don't see that listed anywhere here.

Becky: Yeah, OK, OK, no, that that totally makes sense. Thanks for explaining that a little more clearly. So yeah, maybe let's I have some questions maybe around the the first option there contact us online.

Becky: What do you think that means contact us online or you know what, what sort of response are you expecting to get from that first option?

> P7: Well, I just clicked on it and contact us. OK, so I see this. OK, on this page.

> P7: This is the headings for whatever everything I'm looking at now. I just figured that out.

> P7: So if I just scroll on down, yeah, contact us. Welcome to ask VA looking for status of an inquiry. See it that that's it's wanting a reference number. So this this here is looking for a specific oh, here's a create account sign on to start your message.

> P7: That might be worth clicking on, but chances are not exactly how to do that. That's gonna frustrate me even more 'cause it's gonna basically ask for the same information that I'm looking for and can't find.

> P7: So let me back up. OK, Maybe it's not the right one. OK, right. And yeah, so like I say, any any of these I'd go through, you know, to set up a a log on.

> P7: Main information line. I'm not sure what VA 411 main is. It might be different name for VA log on dot Gov, I don't know, but VA 411 main after all these years, I have no idea what that is.

> P7: Again, the telecommunications relay services, for some reason I'm thinking that is hard of hearing, hard of seeing something that type of of program, but I'm not sure.

> P7: The benefits hotline, that's always a possibility. And even the GI Bill hotline. What, What the heck is the GI Bill hotline anymore? To me, GI Bill was education, housing, loans, that type of thing. But I could be wrong.

> P7: Homeless vets, health benefits, hotlines. Chances are you're gonna talk to a nurse or something is my thoughts. I don't know.

> P7: And so, I mean, that's the way I'd go through and look and just try to figure out what best fits what I'm trying to find. Most of the time I can't find what I'm trying to find.

Becky: Right. Do you think, I noticed you're looking more at those bolded titles a bit more. What information do you think is missing to help clarify what those actually mean?

> P7: A real good right here search box where I can type in specifically what I'm looking for. It never works.

> P7: 90% of the time it doesn't work or it does give you that keyword, but the whatever it brings up, it's like nothing ever really fits what I'm trying to find.

Becky: Yeah. In in this scenario, would you, would you go to the search box right now or did you just open it up 'cause I 'cause I asked? 

> P7: I just opened it up, but I'm typing in "create account VA log on.Gov" and see what it what it brings up.

Becky: OK.

> P7: And we didn't find any result for create account VA log on dot Gov. Try using different words, checking spelling, blah, blah, blah. So it it didn't help 

Becky: So it it didn't help. Got it. You you've hit a dead end already. Right.

> P7: And even if I take away all this and just say "create account"... VA prescription refill and tracking download letters, upgrade premium My HealtheVet change your direct deposit. You know, nothing there fits what I'm looking for.

> P7: If I put in "VA log on.Gov", we didn't find any results for VA log on dot Gov. So that's what I'm saying. It's it's frustrating, right?

Becky: Yeah, yeah, I definitely see that. There's, you know, you just get that message and you sort of have to figure out what to do from there. So what would you do right now?

Becky: So in the scenario, let's say, you know, you called the phone number, you tried the search, you know, no, no answers yet.
 
> P7: I don't know what I'd do. I'd probably say excuse my French, F it. And I might or, and or I might call one of my local VAC box or somebody in [location] and say, can you please help me? Here's my situation. 

> P7: And usually if I call enough people, somebody will eventually after three or four tries, kind of get me in the right direction. And, and a lot of times I realize this isn't the direction I need to go in anyway.

> P7: Because a lot of times what you're looking for, there's six different ways to get there. And this may not be the best way.

Becky: Is there any reason why you would call or maybe reach out to a more local person or organization?

> P7: Just because I can't find anybody at the higher level. When I call, I, I leave a message and nobody gets back to me.

> P7: At least if I call local, I can talk to somebody and say, here's my problem. Can you? And they might, may or may not connect me to, I mean, they'll always connect me to somebody whether they can help me or not. And they may work their way up the chain to get me to where I need to be.

Becky: Got it. Yeah. It feels like it just feels a bit closer, maybe closer to to you and your situation than, you know, higher up on the water there and then. 

[P7 discusses frustration with VA in general]

Becky: It's it's it's frustrating and you know, I've, I've been just observing too and seeing how it's, it's hard to find information.

> P7: Yeah.

Becky: All right, well, that brings us to the end of our second scenario. So you can go ahead and stop sharing your screen.

[P7 stops sharing screen.]

## Review each scenario
Becky: So thank you for viewing those scenarios with me. Your input's been really helpful. And I know this page, it's not quite clear right now. So I'm wondering while you wait for us to make those updates or as we're improving the page, would it be helpful if I showed you how some of these options worked?

> P7: Sure.

[Becky shares screen.]

Becky: So I'll just go through down this list and show you the the response you you could expect if you selected some of these options and and walk you through the the different options.

### Contact us online through Ask VA
[Becky reviews using Ask VA.]

> P7: Now, one of the things when I see a form like that, I, I almost feel like I need to fill in all of those boxes rather than going straight to the question.

> P7: So I'll open all of them boxes and try to fill them in.

Becky: No, that's right.

> P7: I mean, and you know, oh, and it does say, it does say required.

Becky: I mean, and you know, oh, and it does say, it does say required.

> P7: So yeah, Yep, that makes sense.

Becky: So you wouldn't skip to this, this last one here like I just did, You would maybe open this up.

> P7: And, yeah, and sometimes I get hung up just getting through those boxes and get frustrated. And it's like, well, what I'm trying to find isn't listed there and think, well, this isn't where I need to be.

Becky: Got it. Yeah. So that's a great point. Like even though there are so many of these categories, there's no, like, let's say you didn't find the right category. There is one here.

### Ask our chatbot a question
> P7: When you click on something like that, a lot of times it gives you too much information. It's overwhelming. And you're like, I don't even know where to go.

> P7: I'm not gonna read all this. I'm frustrated. You know, I'm not gonna mess with it.

Becky: Got it. Yeah, I do see how there there's a bunch of information, like there's information here, here.

> P7: A lot of times something like that, I'll start clicking on all the links trying to and then I end up down the rabbit hole and it's like I forget what I was even looking for to begin with.

> P7: And I'm clear over here and it's. Yeah. So just to throw that out there.

Becky: No, no, I think that's really helpful.

> P7: Short and sweet is better.

Becky: We're we're trying to balance wanting to be transparent and share everything with, while getting you to the right spot. And I think that's what we're trying to do here.

[Becky goes through chatbot.]

Becky: Do you have any thoughts or reactions to this option here?

> P7: Nope. A lot of times it's just hit, hit and miss as to where you end up. There's so many options. And if you don't click the exact right one, you've gone down the wrong rabbit hole. And three hours later, you're still trying to figure out your original.

> P7: And I'm exaggerating to some of the point. By two hours, I would have done become a statistic, but...

Becky: No, I understand. Yeah, Just just more links to click there.

### Call us
> P7: The 411 in there throws me and maybe it's 'cause I'm in a rural [location] area. We're not big on 411. To other people that may highlight hey, that's information page to me, it's kind of like, you know, get rid of the my VA 411 and just have main information would, would I guess draw my attention more.

> P7: And I know that the page is named, as I think about it and look at it, my VA 411 is the name of the page. But that throws me a little bit just because I'm not familiar with with that.

Becky: Yeah, that that's a really good point. Like this is like, if you think of a brand, this is the brand of the, of the line of the phone, the phone number that distinguishes it from the other phone numbers.

Becky: But this is really what's telling you what the phone number is. So I can see how that can be confusing, especially if you're not familiar with it. Like for people who are familiar with it, maybe it helps.

> P7: But, and, and through some of this while you were clicking and doing stuff, I'm thinking I'll be 70 years old next year and, you know, to, to the younger, I need my grandkids to come and do this because they just click, click, click, click.

> P7: How'd you do that? You know, and what might take me 20 minutes to to find where I'm going, they're just click, click, click and they're there. And it's like, how'd you do that? You know.

Becky: Right. Yeah. And so that, yeah, I notice you're, you know, just strolling, scrolling, you know, taking your time to read through all the information. So I can see that that difference maybe how how we interact with this too. Yeah. 

> P7: And it and and tell you the truth, if you go into most of these VAC box or or go to the VA hospital, the average age is probably fifties, 60s. So, you know, you gotta keep it dumbed down for us old, you know, not not so technical people.

Becky: No, I I definitely hear what you're saying.

[P7 talks about experience with new car.]

## Cool down
Becky: And I see we have around 4 minutes left and we've we've already started doing a little bit of this, but I wanted to spend some time just reflecting before you finished something that stands out to me as you're mentioning like generational differences with using the page.

Becky: But I guess is there anything that, that anything else that could have been easier on the page or anything that you liked about using the contact us page in these scenarios?

> P7: I, I guess there's too many options. It needs to be more, here's your main thing to do to get to where you need to be.

> P7: And then once you click on that, there needs to be less options because the different options are overwhelming.

> P7: If, if it doesn't specify exactly what you're looking for, it's very easy, again, in my terms, to go down the wrong rabbit hole.

> P7: And then you're clicking and, and, and you're just getting further and further away from where you're trying to, to get to, if that makes sense to you, Becky.

Becky: Yeah, I know that that is, that's right. I could see, like we mentioned on the chat bot page, you know, there's a lot of information there. Weren't sure what to interact with.

> P7: Yeah. And, and on that search box. To me, that search box could be so valuable if it worked the way I thought it should work. And maybe it works great.

> P7: Maybe it's me, you know, but usually if I put something in there, I'm thinking, who in the hell did it come up with this list of options when I'm saying I need ABC and it's giving me 123?

> P7: It's like not even the same thing, you know? So yeah, that's that's one of my big pet peeves is the search box.

Becky: Got it.

> P7: And, and the, if you click on a, a list, a list of contacts or a phone list, what you're looking for is never there. It'll give you 20 options.

> P7: And it's like I'm looking for X-ray department and X-ray, it might be under radiology or, or something, you know, it's like, well, you could have radiology but also list X-ray for somebody who thinks it's the X-ray department, you know, and have the same phone number but listed two or three different options.

Becky: Yeah. 

> P7: Just say it. That was my quickest thought on how to explain that. But yeah, a lot of times the option you're looking for just isn't there.

Becky: Yeah. That that makes me think if you what would an ideal contact page look for you then? If not, you know what we have currently, What what would you in in your dream? What would be the best scenario or the best page?

> P7: Talk to people. What, if you were looking for this? What would you call it? Like for instance, your X-rays. Would you would you look under radiology? Would you look under X-rays? Would you look under films?

> P7: And, and then have most of those that, that makes whatever makes sense. If you need 10 different words to get to the same point.

> P7: So have 10 different words, kind of like when you're looking at an index, alphabetical index and it might be the same #10 times, but it's X-ray, it's radiology, it's, you know, films, it's CT scans, it's whatever to get to that, that point, instead of having here's your ten options.

> P7: It's like my option's not there, you know?

Becky: Right. Yeah. Words are really, really important. 

> P7: Yes.

Becky: Yeah. All right.

Becky: Do you have any final questions for me or any thoughts about this, this whole research process that, you know, I can share with my team, anything like that?

> P7: I hope you need to make, you know, some, some positive change in the way that things are done to make it easier on us Veterans. And I appreciate what you're doing.
