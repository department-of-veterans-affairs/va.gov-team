## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
Becky: First, I'd like to just learn a little bit more about your experience with VA and VA customer support. So First off, how long have you been a veteran?

> P4: Since [numberr].

Becky: Oh yeah, that's, that's quite a long time. And in that time, have you had to reach out to VA for customer support?

> P4: I think once or twice I have, but it's only since I've been, since I've been a member of the VA.

> P4: I think in [number] I started with the VA because I was getting ready to retire and realized that I had not used the veterans VA for anything.

> P4: And medical insurance is going to cost me a arm and a leg and part of my head, you know, that's, it's cost a lot of money.

> P4: And I thought I'd better just start using the VA benefits that I that I got when I was in the Air Force.

Becky: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I can see why you might have wanted to reach out to, to VA at that point.

> P4: Yeah. Regretfully, I wish I'd done it sooner, but you can't, can't go back.

Becky: Yes, yeah. Can you walk me through maybe that experience you had with contacting VA or maybe how you might have used VA.gov to to contact VA too?

> P4: Well, first I looked up on the Internet how to get with the VA and there was a phone number that was there. And I left several messages at that point and found out that wasn't the right way to do it, that I needed to go online.

> P4: And then I, I was having difficulty filling out the form from at when I was at work. They, they let me use my work computer to fill out the form online. 

> P4: Well, I think this was actually [number] when they, when I started to fill out the form. And so I got hold of customer support.

> P4: I got some answers, but it was kind of iffy if I was able to get anybody because our, my work hours were from here in [location] from I think it was I, I was at work at 6:00 in the morning until about 3:30 in the afternoon [location]a time because I, I was dealing with the office of [location] quite a bit at that point.

> P4: So trying to get information out of the customary support was kind of hard. But yet I managed to get through it.

> P4: And I ended up going down into the [location] office, VA office there and getting signed up and to get my picture taken and getting all set up for the VA at that point.

> P4: But I think I that I've used it on the va.gov site and it's actually a little bit easier to get answers 'cause they also give you alternate way to search for the question.

> P4: If it's not real urgent, you could search for it and you could come up and list a reasonable answer what you need.

Becky: Yeah, yeah. And you, you mentioned a couple of different ways to contact VA. So, you know, going in person or calling a number, even even searching online on the website to get some answers.

Becky: Do you have a, a preference usually or is there one thing you try to do first over any of the others?

> P4: I try to go through the the.gov site first because it's, it's less time consuming. I'd rather go and, and if I 'cause if it's not a medical problem, I'm, I'm looking for that.

> P4: I, it's just another, I don't have to talk to my doctor or a specialist. I had, I could, I actually look up things on the VA site like for dietary needs and stuff like that.

> P4: I it's easier for me to look it up that way on the Internet, on the VA website.

Becky: OK, now that that makes sense. Rather than, you know, waiting on the phone, you can just look up information yourself.

> P4: Yeah.

Becky: Yeah. Are there any other examples of things you've you've tried to look up or other examples of questions you've had to ask VA recently?

> P4: I can't remember. My brain gets a little foggy at times.

Becky: Yeah. No worries. All right, Well, thank you for, you know, sharing some of those experiences with VA.

Becky: And now what I'm going to do is give you 2 scenarios where you, as a veteran, would reach out to VA for help. And these scenarios are actually real questions that Veterans asked us this year. They've just been reworded.

> P4: OK.

## Scenarios
Becky: Yeah, Before we do that, I'm going to send you a link to the current Contact us page on VA.gov and I see you are able to open the chat. So let me know if you can open this link up on your phone.

> P4: I see. OK, I see it. Contact us here in front of me on this page.

Becky: OK, so you've opened up the page already? 

> P4: Yeah.

Becky: Alrighty. And now have you shared your screen on Zoom on your phone before?

> P4: I think I have.

Becky: OK, let me know if you need help with that, but I'd like you to share the contact us page you just opened.

[Becky and P4 troubleshooting how to share screen for ~10 minutes]

Becky: Thanks for taking the time to to troubleshoot too. All right, So I'll, like I mentioned, I'm going to give you 2 scenarios.
### Login scenario
Becky: So I'll give you the first one right now, OK. And the first one is, so you're a veteran in this scenario and you can't create an account on va.gov.

Becky: What you're trying to do is create a Login.gov account, but Login.gov doesn't let you use your passport as a form of identification, and you don't have your driver's license right now because you lost it recently.

Becky: So starting on this page, show me how you would find help for this scenario. And as you're showing me, tell me what you're thinking and noticing too.

> P4: Let's see.

Becky: Right. So I see you selected some of those links at the top first right? 

Becky: And you selected the link to go to ask VA. Any reason why you you chose that link?

> P4: No, it just seemed like the logical place to go.

Becky: OK Is that because it was, you know, maybe just the first option on the page and you're just testing things out or any other reason?

> P4: No, I just, it seems like if you're going to try to do something with the VA, you ask the VA.

Becky: Oh, OK, So the language around ask ask VA drew you to this option.

> P4: Yeah. It justs says, this is because if you're going to try to do something with the VA, you try to, you go to the VA and you're asking that question probably be about the easiest way to do it and then try to find instead of trying to go through a whole lot of other ways to do it.

> P4: I was in IT, and it always said, go if you got a problem, go to the source and or find the source. And that was, that was always the way we worked was say, you always, you picked the first one that looked like Contact us, Ask VA for a VA question how to join the VA.

Becky: OK and sorry, going going back up and pausing there for a second. What do you think Contact us online through Ask VA means?

> P4: You're on the Internet. Through the website.

Becky: Yeah, got it. And what do you think you expect to happen after your, after you go through this through this link that you had selected?

> P4: I expect that in a timely manner, I'll get a reply back either confirming that they got the message or asking for a little more information, what I'm what I'm trying to say, and then or they'll give me an answer.

> P4: And if it's not exactly the answer that looks like what I need, but I and I could respond back to them, we'll narrow it down as to what exactly needs to be I actually need to do or what I need to give them.

Becky: OK, yeah. That, that makes sense that you'd expect that type of type of response from from VA.

> P4: Yeah, Yeah, I do, I do because usually when I ask questions, they, they're pretty informative. You know, they, they say here's what you need or I think this is what you're asking about.

> P4: Or can you give me a little more information? And I, I'll provide them all the information that I could possibly give them.

> P4: And and then we'll, we'll work it out or somebody will contact me by phone so we can actually talk.

Becky: Oh, OK. So expect you expect maybe to be redirected to a phone call or, or some other way to contact VA too if you need to?

> P4: Yeah, they, yeah, they usually just call me on my cell phone, you know, if they have questions. Otherwise they send me information usually within about an hour I get the information I need.

Becky: OK, And are you referring to a, a specific tool you've used in the past when you say you know usually get information after an hour? Or is that just like an estimate based on other experiences?

> P4: Well, sometimes when I've asked in in the old website, it was going through the messaging and then I scroll down, I find the, what I think is the appropriate department I need to talk to, let's say customer or yeah, veteran support or whatever it is or crisis center.

> P4: They, I'll set, set the message up as a not as a medical need, but you know, as a information need or whatever it was.

> P4: And then they'll respond back to that and they'll say this is not the right department, but I'm going to direct you to the right department. And here's where you go.

Becky: OK. Yeah. And you know, in, in this case, you're, you're sending a message and in that past experience you mentioned that's also sending a message.

Becky: Is that your, is that what you would try to do first when, when you have a question?

> P4: Yeah, yeah, 'cause I usually found this going through messaging is, is quicker.

> P4: But sometimes when I go to the VA home site, the the, the main page, they've got news there.

> P4: Sometimes I'll find that information and where they can, they'll have look up where the I can tell them what I kind of information I'm looking for and they'll bring up an article or or they'll give me the contact information.

Becky: Got it. OK, that, that makes sense.

Becky: I guess sticking to the scenario again, you're, you're trying to create a login.gov account, but you only have a passport and login.gov doesn't accept a passport as an ID.

Becky: Let's say, you know, you send your message through Ask VA, but you get a response that doesn't quite answer the the question or resolve the problem that you're having with creating this account.

Becky: So what would you do next if you know this first path didn't work out for you?

> P4: Hold on here. Let me unhook her. Yeah, go ahead. Go see [name]. OK. Thank you. There, there. Now she's gone.

Becky: Yeah, No worries. And feel free to look. Look on the page too, if that would help to see, you know, what you would do next in terms of contacting VA.

Becky: Do you, do you mind me asking what intrigued you about the, the local VA facility section?
 
> P4: Well, I see I, that's how I, I, I've gotten my answers in the first place.

> P4: So I've got the phone phone number for the that for the the [location] office and and they don't, I could get information from them that way.

> P4: I'm trying to, let's see here. I'm going down at the bottom here.

> P4: I see. OK, I see. Change your address. OK, I've seen that. I've used that before. That was that was good, but and then explore the facts. That's the other way that I'd I'd do it.

> P4: But actually I just get on the phone and say, OK, I got a passport. How am I supposed to get, show you my, give you my correct if my other information when I don't have a driver's license or [location] State ID card.

Becky: Yeah yeah. So how would you how would you choose the phone number to call? Since you know when you scrolled up there before, there were quite a few phone numbers that you could that you could choose.

Becky: So how would you find the right one?

> P4: I don't know. I just I grab 1 and I just I dial OK, OK, so they say here, let me redirect you if that number is or or they say you sometimes there'll be a recording, they'll say if you got this, if you got, if you need to talk to somebody, you call this number, but press this number.

> P4: It won't redirect you, but this is the number that you normally should call. They'll they'll kind of redirect you a little bit.

Becky: OK, yeah, that, that makes sense. And you know, is a familiar experience myself with with calling a customer support number.

Becky: So it sounds like you just expect to be redirected to the right team that can answer your question.

> P4: Yeah, Yeah. And I'm thinking of last year, we had a problem with our stove and we got, and it took a while, but we found where we're supposed to go. And it's who we were supposed to talk to about and [location].

> P4: And they, they were able to get the repairs done on it took a little while, but a couple days, But we, we finally got it all taken care of.

> P4: But they will you call, will you call like the VA, they'll main number for [location].

> P4: They'll they'll give you a, a list of options of everything from mental health down to if you just need customer service.

> P4: So that's how I that's how I usually arrive at where I need to go.

Becky: OK, so it sounds like you called the, the local number for your facility, right?

Becky: OK, yeah, I'm curious, just with the phone numbers up top, if you if you scroll up, what you would choose to call in in the scenario with the account problem.

> P4: OK, I can call this number here that says help that help desk and they'll they'll usually that number probably won't send me to somebody.

> P4: They'll say they can help me or they could redirect me or I could go to or I could go to this get the full list VA phone numbers.

> P4: OK, like like that one there, this one here, but this is the main one. I'm not I I don't think I've ever called this 800 number.

> P4: But but I I but I think that I just calling them real. Any of the numbers don't just end up saying can't help you, but we can send you to the right place oughta.

Becky: OK, so you feel like, you know, regardless of maybe any number you call, you'll you'll get there eventually.

> P4: Yes.

Becky: OK. Yeah, And as you're scrolling down, what are you skimming for here right now? Like what are you looking?

> P4: I I've been trying to see if there's an actual phone number to see where call in for information, but I see that the East Coast numbers have all the, all the, all the good stuff.

Becky: Yes, yes, I'm a fellow [location]. So I, I always have to do the time zone math too.

> P4: Yeah, yeah, I have I have to, I, I have to translate that because you're [number] hours ahead where if you're on the East Coast, you're [number] hours ahead of ahead of me.

> P4: And because it's it's only 12:04 now.

Becky: Right, right. So it looks like you're, you know, you're paying attention to the time zones as a person living on [location].

Becky: And you were looking at maybe what the those headings were for the phone number is to see if you could find one that fits.

> P4: Yeah. And if it if all if, if, if I if I don't see like a heading here where I'm scrolling, then I just go straight here today.

> P4: The benefits hotline and just or the help VA help desk, one of those two that'll that should take me right to give me at least get me to where I need to go.

Becky: Got it. And and is it just like the the word hotline or help desk that makes makes you think, OK, there's going to be people on the other end of the line that can help me?

Becky: Is it those words in particular that's telling you?

> P4: Yeah. Eventually I may have to go through a, a recording or through a automated office assistant, but at least they, if I, if I, if I'm on the line long enough, eventually, let's say, let me give you to a operator and or a through to a technician or to a specialists.

> P4: And then I, I'll be talking to somebody like you and say, here's my problem. And then then we could work, work through it.

Becky: Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense that you'd have that expectation.

> P4: Yeah. It's when they're fully automated that drives me nuts.

Becky: Oh, really? Have you not had a, a good experience with the automated phone tree?

> P4: Eventually you want to go, you just want to yell out my person, but that doesn't help. You just got to understand.

Becky: You press 0 a bunch like that sort of thing.

> P4: Yeah, you, you, you have to laugh. But at the same time you, you're giving it dirty looks and everything else.

> P4: And if that doesn't help and you end up hitting zero and sometimes that helps, but I like to have it partially automated just so they'll see what the problem is and then it'll it'll direct you to the proper person or proper department.

Becky: OK, that, that makes sense. All right, I think that answers or, you know, we've gone through that first scenario with the account.

Becky: So you can go ahead and go back to the contact us page and you can either select yes, There you go.

### Claims scenario
Becky: All right, So this is your, this will be the second and final scenario. And in the scenario, you're also a veteran and you currently get disability compensation for shoulder pain.

Becky: And you've been noticing that your shoulder has been hurting more in the past couple of months. And you want to know if you can request more compensation for your shoulder pain because it's worse now and and you don't know if you can request more compensation.

Becky: So that's what you're trying to find out. So again, starting on this page, show me how you'd find help for this new scenario.

Becky: And again, tell me what you're thinking and noticing too, what you're looking for.

> P4: Let's see, where's my disabilities?

Becky: OK. So sounds like you're looking for that keyword.

> P4: Yeah, I kind of looked for that keyword there. Let me go all over to the bottom. Here we go.

> P4: I could do this, the claim or appeal and because that may they could check the status of my disability and also they could probably update my my disability or give me information if I can apply for greater, greater disability or greater payment.

> P4: Yeah, I might be able to go there.

Becky: OK, that that makes sense. And I see you're in the helpful online tool section. So I'm curious, what do you think an online tool is? What does that mean to you?

> P4: When you get when you get a hyperlink like this where it says change your address or anything like that, you click on that, it's it'll take you right to the page that you need to go to the either change the address or change the direct deposit or you need to change your VA claim or anything.

> P4: But if you look for that underlined hyperlink, that'll help you out.

Becky: OK, yeah. And do you think you can use these tools without signing in or do you think you'll have to sign in to, to be able to, you know, go to the hyperlink and do what you need to do?

> P4: You might be able to I, I haven't clicked on any of these yet, but I, but eventually you're gonna have to sign in and they're, they're gonna need to at least know your, your last four plus you're verified of the information and you.

> P4: So if you haven't been able to sign in yet on the VA website, that might be difficult.

> P4: But if you're already got an id.gov or a or the other other forms I'd log in, then you could use these easily.

> P4: I haven't, I haven't clicked on any of these, so I don't, I don't know.

Becky: Yeah, yeah. In this scenario, you know, if you were to if you would click on the link, you can go ahead and click on it if if you would like.

> P4: Sign in. Yeah, because it's all it got, the different, the different log is, like for me, it would be ID dot me.

> P4: So I could log into that and or the id.gov or whatever it is that they call it.

> P4: Because here in the state of [location], you use that ID and it gets you into [name] and then also get you into some of the other state, the state programs that should be used easily.

Becky: OK, yeah. And you know, that makes sense. You know, you're, you're familiar with the ID dot me account or even signing into other, you know, other services like like [name], like you're saying.

Becky: And just to remind you of the scenario again, which is you have worsening shoulder pain that you currently receive disability compensation for and you want to know if you can increase your compensation.

Becky: Would you would you then sign in if you landed on this page to to find out an answer to that question? What, what would you do next in this?

> P4: Well, I, I could either sign in, but I see down here at the bottom it says can I check what kind of claims I could check in?

> P4: So I'm assuming that disability compensation I will be under that, but I could also.

> P4: So I'm thinking I could sign into that and if I had a disability and see maybe there's something in there that where I could note that I need more compensation because of this pain or the, or the bones or grading are, you know, or the shoulders gone numb.

> P4: And they'll probably send you to the doctor, get that verified and have that so you can get that paperwork filled out.And then they make a decision from there.

Becky: Got it, yeah. It's really helpful to hear just what you would without signing in, just what you would expect to happen if you were to sign in with the same challenge and, and go through that whole process.

Becky: If you let's go back to the contact us page again, I'm going to ask you a sort of a similar question as before.

Becky: So let's say you signed in, but you can't, you don't find the answer to your question. And So what would you do next in this scenario?

> P4: In that case, I would call.

Becky: OK, so interesting.

> P4: I would call the the the main hospital phone number where the customer service is and speak to a person at that point.

Becky: OK. And is there a reason why you would call? I think you said the local hospital customer service number rather than any other number.

> P4: Well, there's, hold on here. Let me let me go in here down at the bottom here. OK, I've got all these the VA numbers I've just called the, I, I would call the the central scheduling number here.

> P4: You OK that number right there and they don't send me to the right direction.  I need to go to.

Becky: Got it. So are these all numbers that you've had previous experience with?

> P4: Yeah, yeah. And but then as a new one pops, it comes up, then I just then I then I add it in.

Becky: Got it. OK. That's been really helpful to know like that you're you're keeping track of of different phone numbers like that. That's really interesting.

> P4: Yeah, it's easier that way. That and also when somebody for the VA calls, I can tell see which location they're at.

> P4: So that just like if I 'cause I go to the [location] office a lot, I could, I could tell when it's my doctor calling me or the nurse calling me, or if it's going to be somebody down to [location] office, which is the main office.
 
> P4: I, I can see what it's going to be that number there. It just makes it just makes it easier to know which number I need to talk to.

Becky: Yeah, I'm, I'm sort of curious, how should I phrase this? How did you how did you find the contact information initially?

> P4: Hold on here. What happened?

Becky: Oh, no worries. Oh, I think you are sorry. I wasn't looking at the screen, too.

> P4: OK. Where'd you where'd it go? All right, where'd it go?

Becky: No worries. Yeah. And I think what you know, we're we're coming down to the end of the scenario so you can actually stop sharing your screen. It's all good.

> P4: OK, Hold on here.

Becky: Yeah. I see what you are seeing now.

> P4: Where'd it go? OK, let me get out of this. I'll stop. Get out of this site here and stop. Stop sharing the screen. There we go.

Becky: All right, now you're back.

> P4: All right, All right. Touch the wrong button sometimes in the.

Becky: Yeah, no worries. I think you're getting a a call too.

> P4: So yeah, but I sent that to message whatever it was. 

## Review each scenario
Becky: OK, thank you. 

Becky: All right, so you stopped sharing your screen and we've read those two scenarios.

Becky: And again, thank you because like I said, your input's been really helpful and it's been helpful even, you know, outside of the scenarios to understand how you would approach some something.

Becky: So I know this page might not be very clear right now. And so while, you know, we're making these updates, do you think it'd be helpful if I show you how some of these contact options work right now, if you'd like?

> P4: Sure.

Becky: All right. So in that case, what I'll do is I'll start sharing my screen. We'll see if I find, you know, the right button myself.

Becky: And I'll also review the login scenario, which is I'm a veteran who can't create a Login.gov account because I only have my passport.

Becky: So let me start sharing my screen and I'll go through just how you might use each different contact option and let me know how this looks for you.

Becky: If it looks like super tiny because you're on a mobile device, how does that look?

> P4: I, I turned it sideways.

Becky: OK, is it better if I zoom in a little maybe?

> P4L There it is. That's good.

Becky: OK, great. So what we'll what I'll go through is just all the different options that you could have gone through to answer this question.

[Becky does walk through. See this section in the conversation guide]

### Contact us online through Ask VA
Becky: Do you have any questions or any reactions to this first contact method?

> P4: No, no, no, it could you give a, a brief summary what you need there.

> P4: We know what category it is. It's basically log in without, with, with passport. You can put that in there. Maybe they'll they'll figure it out what you need, need to do.

Becky: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

> P4: That's where you'd put it.

Becky: Great. So that's the first, the first option you could have gone through there.

### Ask our chatbot a question
> P4: OK, yeah, I've tried using something like this that chat bot before.

> P4: And be honest, I, after about two or three minutes, I usually get frustrated and back out of it.

> P4: And I, it was even when I was before I retired, I, I always got frustrated by these.

Becky: Yeah.

> P4: Without being able to actually talk to somebody to get the information, you sometimes if you didn't put the information or I put a question incorrectly, you get you wouldn't get the answer that you needed.

> P4: It would suddenly give you 20 different other answers and none of them what you needed.

> P4: That's I, I guess with with my mind, it was a little bit difficult to get to be patient with them.

Becky: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. That that makes sense, especially because again, this is this is automated. So, you know, it's doing its best guess to try to understand what you're you're telling it.

[Becky walks through using the chatbot]

Becky: Do you have any, any questions or you know, did I change your mind about chat bots or any any good actions?

> P4: Well, when you click on the contact VA, where does that go to give you phone numbers or just OK, you can go to the phone numbers.

Becky: So it would, you know, it in a way it would bring me back in a loop back to the contact us page or I could go to this phone numbers page which you opened before. Yeah, just some options there.

> P4: It'd be nice if we can get the phone numbers depending on where you're at in the United States, you know, if you could have a place to type in your zip code or your, your state and it'll come up with the numbers call for that, that state and it'll give you the times for that state.

> P4: You know, instead of, instead of calling these main numbers are on the East Coast because it, it's kind of hard sometimes to sit there and calculate. OK, what time is it?

> P4: And for some people, they, they, they, they lose track of what time it is.

Becky: Absolutely no, that, that definitely makes sense. And so it sounds like you'd want like a local, a local phone number, a more direct phone number rather than maybe a general like East Coast number that you're seeing here. Is that right?

> P4: Right. Let's say somewhere at the top of the page it says it could get based on your IP address or your, or if your or your, you just type in, OK, I meant this zip code here and you click this, it'll come up with the phone numbers for you to call.

> P4: It'll populate the local phone numbers. Let's say, 'cause we have several area codes here, but I'll just pick one now. It'll say, OK, you're up at the 76O, but you can use the 858 numbers and that'll get you the information out out of the main, main VA center. It'll make it it makes it easy then 

Becky: You're, you're wanting some more individualized information based on your location or

> P4: Well, some of the sometimes when I'm looking for information, they'll say, OK, let's let's take Lowe's hardware store.

> P4: If I, if I ask them a question, they'll say at the top they say where are you located?

> P4: And I'll say near [location] and they'll they'll they'll bring up the, the full, the phone numbers I need to contact or the, or the closest store I need to go to or people I need to talk to.

Becky: Yeah, you know what? That's a great, that's a great point.

> P4: Yeah, it's on their website and it's it's up at the corner, left hand, upper left hand corner where I can I see it real easy.
