## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
Becky: It seems like we're ready to get started. That was the last thing I had to ask is just around the recordings. So I want to learn more about your experience with VA and VA customer support a little bit about that. So around, how long have you been a Veteran?

> P11: Since [year].

Becky: All right. And in that time, have you ever used the contact Us page on the new va.gov site?

> P11: Not, it just came out right. So I have, well, it was a couple years ago, I'd say, well, yes, because I during COVID, I had to have my, my, my appointments, you know, anyway, they, I was given a, a Apple iPad or, you know, anyway, it was a device that the VA gave me.

> P11: And, and so when I lose my password or have technical problems, I call I, I would call them, you know, but as far as the, this new website, I've usually been accessing my HealtheVet, which they say that it covers, you know, the huge, all the other websites.

> P11: I know it's going to, you know, die out soon, like E benefits. And it's all kind of confusing because I'm an older Veteran before technology, you know, when you had to, when there were payphones on every corner and you can get air in your tire for free, you know?

> P11: Yeah, well, you have full service at the, at the gas station. You know, you, you wouldn't know that maybe you your grandparents or something. But life was so much simpler then.

> P11: But anyway, it it my frustration is that that the different websites and the different things keep changing. It keeps changing.

> P11: And I mean, there's so many ways I do to verify my ID me, what's those this other thing? It's like four or five options. And I have, you know, ended up my information on all of them. But like, it's just a verifying your password and identity three or four time it. That's what gets me.

> P11: That's what gets me, you know, OK, I already gave you my password, my use my password. I may have even used my fingerprint on my phone to verify me. Now you want to call me? Now I got to answer an e-mail. I mean, you know, it may be nothing to a younger person, but for me, that's a bit much, right?

Becky: Yeah. The fact that you have to, you know, do the same thing and, you know, verify your identity. I I've been hearing that from other veterans too, in so many different ways.

> P11: You know, I mean, yeah, that's the biggest hang up that I have.

Becky: Yeah. No. Well, things are explaining that, you know, we, we will walk through a, a scenario around logging in later, but I'll get to that in a bit.

Becky: But first I wanted to go back to maybe something you mentioned about, I think you mentioned contacting the OR calling them. How did you in that situation find the right phone number to call them?

> P11: Well, it's, it's on the back of my, my electronic device. So what do you call it? A tablet. Tablet. I'm a dinosaur. Yeah. On the type, the tablet, it's on the back.

> P11: And then when you first log in and everything, they, you know, they give you that information, you know, like doing FaceTime, They, they give you all the before the, the meeting even or group even starts so you can write it down or, or whatever, you know, right then. So for that, that was easy.

Becky: OK. And would you say so it sounds like you found the phone number like on the back of your tablet and maybe when you first get onto the website, would you say that calling by phone is your preference for contacting VA or you know, have you tried to contact them online before?

> P11: Yes, I have. I've tried to contact them to arrange appointments or cancel appointments or reschedule and it did not go through. But like I said, that was through My HealtheVet, the secure messaging.

Becky: Oh, OK, yeah.

> P11: Then I get a letter saying I'm a no show or whatever, you know, although I was guaranteed, you know, online that the message was went through. So wherever it went, but it must not have gone to the right person.

Becky: Got it sounds like things aren't aren't talking to each other after you send the message.

> P11: Maybe exactly. And it and it's a big thing when you're a no show, you know, and my primary care provider explained it to me that, you know, it's a government thing about US keeping our appointments because if we don't, it seems like that, that, you know, that hospital, that clinic is unnecessary.

Becky: OK.

> P11: And it could be, you know, taking up, you know, deleted or or whatever stopped on it.

Becky: Yeah, I didn't, I didn't know about that. Thanks for explaining that. I'm curious, are you, are you familiar with finding information on a contact us page? Like does that sound familiar to you on VA or even in other websites you've seen?

> P11: Yes. And that's frustrating. Well, in one instance, I mean a few instances, but you, you won't, you want me to just talk about the VA or our contact page because I'm mad as hell at Peacock, The, the TV, the TV streaming service.

Becky: Oh, yeah, I guess. So I was going to ask what, what information do you usually expect on that sort of page? And it sounds like maybe your expectations weren't met with Peacock.

> P11: Well, The thing is, you can't get a live person when you're spending your money. You can you a live person is [word] near a mission. You know a combat mission do or die. You can't never, you got to go through all these trouble to get a live person.

> P11: Even with the VA sometime you know to get a live person you have to go through 5 minutes of BS in order to just ask a question or reschedule appointment that I I may have had 10 Mama, I have 15 minutes before my appointment and it takes me 12 1/2 before I get somebody.

> P11: By that time, I'm frustrated. I'm, I'm saying things that, you know, being mean and everything, but it's out of frustration of going through so much artificial intelligence when you know, when somebody can just pick up after I verify who I am, my social, my last four, my birthday, my first born, you know, my bloodline.

> P11: And yeah, that's frustrating to go through so much. And I'm talking about the cable company. I mean, but anyway, VA has done it to me also.

> P11: And then I will get a call center person, you know, after all this, and this is often it's if I don't call like my work pen, I was usually about 7:30.

> P11: Well, 8:00 between 8:00, if I don't call between 8:00 and 8:30 to whatever, it's it's impossible, almost impossible to get through and talk to the department of whoever I need to talk to.

Becky: Got it. So it sounds like you, you really want to talk to a live agent. Sometimes you get routed to like a an AI or or something, but that's not what you want. You want to talk to an actual person.

[P11 talks about challenges with Peacock customer service and other experiences.]

## Scenarios
Becky: So I'll give you 2 scenarios where you as a veteran would reach out to VA for help. And these scenarios are actually real questions that veterans asked us this year. They've just been reworded.

Becky: And so with that, if you can find the chat, I'm going to send you a link in the chat right now and go ahead and open that.

[P11 starts screen sharing.]

Becky: Yeah it it looks quite different from from E benefits or you know those other websites you've been using. So I'm glad that we're we're getting chance to look at this today.

### Login scenario
Becky: I'll go ahead and give you our our scenario for a session and I'll have you imagine that you're a Veteran and the scenario is you are having trouble creating an account on va.gov and what you're doing is trying to create a login.gov account in particular.

Becky: But login.gov isn't letting you use your passport as a way to verify your identity and you don't have your driver's license because you lost it recently. 

Becky: So you only have your passport. You can't create an account right now. So starting on this page, show me how you would find help for this scenario.

Becky: And as you're showing me, tell me what you're thinking and noticing on this page too.

> P11: Just look through the whole thing and read it or something.

Becky: Yeah. Yeah. Just imagine you're in this situation and what what would you actually do?

> P11: My one thing I would do is press call us, hoping that I can speak to a live person. That's the first thing that I see that I would bam, you know. 

Becky: OK, what would you expect to happen if you press to call us?

> P11: I would explain my problem, which would be my trouble logging in and, you know, explain the barriers of why I can't log in, which you say all I have is a passport.

> P11: But you see, you know, and, and explain you know what, I, you know what, I have the problem. You know what I have, and can you help me?

Becky: Yeah. Yeah. Is there a reason why this stands out to you rather than all the other things you're seeing right now?

> P11: Yes, because hopefully I can speak to a live person eventually.

Becky: Ok. Yeah. Why don't you go ahead and press call us and we'll we'll see what happens. And then you can tell me what you're seeing.

> P11: Then I see my VA 411 main information like, oh, I didn't know about this.

> P11: That's good if you need an interpreter telecommunications, VA benefit hotline, which I called yesterday, GI Bill, national call for homeless veterans, VA you know, My HealtheVet health, other VA phone numbers, contact local facility and then fax you know, frequently ask answer questions to get answers and you know, helpful tools online direct advisor changed my address.

> P11: Y'all trying to cram all this stuff into one little thing and that's what it gets people messed up.

> P11: I don't went through all this stuff all this heartache and now you tell like schedule a manager VA appointment. OK, that was on My HealtheVet and claim more appeal. 

> P11: You know, all this is E benefits. So you're cramming all this stuff together.

> P11: OK, can I click on my claim or appeal or No, no, I have to follow what you're saying because this is where I needed to be, and yesterday I got so frustrated, I went to bed.

Becky: No worries.

> P11: I can't even log in. You know, because you got to go through our stuff if you forget and sometimes like if I'm using the wrong phone, I have two phones.

> P11: The information that's stored in the in one phone isn't in the other one. No matter how many right answers I get saying who I am, the device is is doesn't match. So you know, F you.

> P11: Yeah, yeah. Well, we caught we caught a mistake. We caught. Gotcha. You didn't do this, you cut then you got to have this that, that, that and that.

Becky: What were you trying to do on the, on the claims page or, but that was the page you were on.

[P11 discusses C&P experience.]

[BP shares screen to demo 'Check your VA claim, decision review, or appeal status' page.]

> P11: I like having my healthy vet, but maybe this is easier va.gov. Maybe it's been easier. It hasn't been easier for me lately.

> P11: I've got, I've learned a lot about it, but you know, as far as me actually getting in by my password or whatever, I got to go through just to, to get the door open. I, I, I, I had trouble.

Becky: Yeah, yeah. And I, I've been hearing, you know, a lot of your experiences and you've been trying to get information, but it's still, it's still hard to look on the website. And even when you call, they might, they might, it sounds like they might not have the answer to. But what I can do right now at least, is maybe walk through each of these different options and then show you what you might expect if you like, for example, called VA.

Becky: So that's what I'll, I'll do right now if that's helpful. How does that sound for you?

> P11: That's fine.

### Claims scenario
[BP skipped and moved to reviewing each contact option on VA.gov.]

## Review each scenario
### Call us
Becky: I'm curious, do you have any thoughts or reactions to that that interaction or?

> P11: Yeah. Would that be the first number I called on when all else fails? Yeah, this was the first number. Actually. I just called this like you see this 800 number here and I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm writing it down out of my notebook. I figured this is something I need.

> P11: You know, I'm, I was looking forward to disappointment to, to take notes. So cause a lot of time with my luck, my issues are complex. And the passport thing is a good one.

> P11: You know that, you know, the average person representative may may not have because most of the time the first thing you're going to get is a call center that's going to direct you to where they think you should go.

> P11: So right.

Becky: Yeah. And I will say, you know, if they can't answer your question, they may direct you to someone else. But in this case, they were able to give me some answers. So that was helpful.

> P11: OK, Yeah. But if you have account issues then you would just call this four in one number.

Becky: You know if you if we Scroll down, there are other numbers for more specific things you might call like benefits or education benefits, homeless veterans, etcetera.

> P11: Yeah, this is good. This you know, this is good. I like the layout here, you know, it, it that got the bold up there so I don't make mistake anything.

> P11: And then, yeah, I, I like the, the format and the layout of this because it's easy to read and easy to understand.

> P11: The National Call Center for homeless veterans. And there's the number VA benefit health Visible hotline and, you know, other numbers, phone numbers. And I like this.

> P11: It's easy to read and it's easy, like I said, 'cause sometimes things just run all together or whatever the hell.

> P11: But yeah, this is cool. This part is good. I like this.

> P11: And, and the VA 411. I did not know that before you pointed out today. And that's a big thing for me 'cause I'll burn that number in my brain.

Becky: Yeah, I'm glad. It's, it's meant to be the, the, the one number you can call VA four. And then if the, if that call center can't answer your question, then they might direct you to these more specific numbers.

> P11: Yeah, that that takes away from a lot of frustration. Like I can call that number and tell them the problems I'm having with va.gov or my my other, what you say those the other credentials that ID me.

> P11: Like I say, I've tried all of them and this all in there somewhere in outer space or whatever. And if I could just grab each one and somebody walk me just like you're walking me through.

[BP explains purpose of reserach study, since P11 asked.]

[BP answers question about when identity credentials will phase out.]

> P11: I hope that's in your research that people that are over a certain age that are not used to technology, you need to make it more user friendly, I guess.

[P11 talks about technology experience.]

## Cool down
Becky: I see where a minute out there's a there's one last question I want to ask and it's, you know, on this page, looking at all of these things, is there anything that could have been easier or anything that you liked?

Becky: I know you mentioned the phone numbers that was helpful, but anything else that could have been easier maybe?

> P11: OK. Are you controlling the way I'm looking at the screen? Because can I scroll up and down?

Becky: Yeah, I'm controlling it right now. 

> P11: Because I saw something I don't care about no chat bot, OK, because they're they they just have a script of so many things issues, you know, and if it's complex, that's no good.

[BP wraps up sesssion.]
