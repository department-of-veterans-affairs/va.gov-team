## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
Becky: Alright, so it seems like we're ready to get started. And first, I'd just like to begin learning a bit more with your experience with VA customer support. And so how long have you been a veteran?

> P1: I've been a Veteran for nearly [number] years. So from when I first enlisted, and I've been retired for [number] years.

Becky: And in your time as as a Veteran, so far, have you ever used the Contact us page on VA.gov?

> P1: Oh yes.

Becky: Great. Can you walk me through like, maybe a recent experience you've had with using the page?

> P1: Very unproductive is the VA has partnered with Login.gov and ID Me for their verification updates. Unfortunately, they made it sound like it would happen after the 1st of the year, January 2025. But they've already started to implement. They've already firewalled off certain pages on the VA without warning or notification. I won't go into all the details. Why, I can't meet the requirements for either Login.gov or ID me.

> P1: And I've probably had 40 emails with Id Me. And every single session with them is, well, contact the people at your agency. Aka, VA. Everybody wants to send me back to the VA. As if they think that there's some simple person to reach out and contact about this process.

> P1: I've gone through page after page between, you know, webmasters, whatever anything I could find to where there's anybody that is paying any attention to what's going on, and there simply isn't. And I haven't had any response to that. 

Becky:  Got it. So it sounds like, maybe I'm reading between the lines here a bit. So let me know if this sounds right. Bu twere you able to find the contact information you were needing? Or are you still at a point where you don't know who to contact?

> P1: I can't, both, could not find anybody that because, you know, I get all the regular VA emails. Aware that they would be transitioning eventually to ID me. But I went back through all the old emails looking for points of contact, went through the website looking for somebody that is specifically becauseI'm a tech guy. And I've been with ID me for years. And they just arbitrarily started deactivating accounts because they decide they need a higher level of verification with the VA. Now than they ever did before.

> P1: Now I live overseas, and this is affecting hundreds, if not thousands, of other Veterans that have not, I haven't been back. I haven't lived in the US In over 20 years. I got sent overseas shortly after 9/11. And so it's caused problems for me. It's caused problems for other Veterans, and we've discussed this at length.

> P1: How many of stuff of us are having problems with both in Logiv.gov. And now ID me. And them ignoring all of our complaints and saying, go, talk to the VA. And when we say who do you suggest? Because you're the partners with the VA. Not me. I'm low man on the pole. So you tell me your technical contact is with the VA to iron this out, because now we're having people that did get validated Id me accounts, and they still have problems not being able to log in. And again, we don't know who at the VA is addressing these specific complaints.

> P1: Because you just get all the routine, if you try and find any information about it. It's just a promotional message that oh, these are our partners, and we'll be doing this next year. Well, no, they're doing it now, and so yeah, it's just been very frustrating trying to find what office is even responsible for this. And it doesn't, because it doesn't seem to fall under anybody right now, because technically, it wasn't supposed to be implemented yet. 

Becky: Yeah, I'm I'm really sorry to hear that it sounds like, you know, you're really trying to make the effort to you know, follow the right steps. But maybe that that information isn't as easily available on on VA.gov as it as it should be right now. And I guess I'm curious in your experience, too, ahat sort of support channels did you try to find first? Was it phone email, or like articles. What was your step?

> P1: Well, first was, I said, I pulled up all, did a search of all my VA emails that had the term Login.gov, or ID me. There were no, you know, more questions or more information. There were links that were just basically promotional pages talking about it, and how easy it was. And just here's our partners redirect.

> P1: But everything was always pushing you back to those 2 partner sites, but nothing within the VA website saying, oh, and you know, if you're still using a CAC card or your DS Logon, or your previous ID me logon. The only thing we can do is once again. We'll just send you over to DS Logon. We'll send you over to your agency's, you know, CAC Administration and again, like I said, I already had an ID me account, and they just say, oh, well, you just need to go through and reverify. Oh, sorry you're not eligible anymore.

> P1: So yeah, so couldn't find anything in the emails. Couldn't find anything in the promotional information all the anything you click on within the web page always sent you back to another promotional message and redirected you to ID me or Login.gov. And and even like Login.gov, when you've gone through every potential option they give you to fix.

> P1: The last one you're presented with is, go to your local post office. It's only post offices in the Continental United States. So even though we have military post USPS, postal service stations overseas, they haven't even identified that as being an option, and that's the only that is literally the last option available to anybody living overseas is to go to the nearest military base. Go to the USPS. Uou know. It's the Military Operated Office in USPS to go there, but they they know nothing about this program at all, so we can't even get it verified in person anywhere.

Becky: Oh, so when, you, so it sounds like when you've gone to the military base for that last in-person option, they don't know. 

> P1: Never. They've never heard of it, and they have nobody to contact, because, you know, you pull up the webpage on your phone and you show them how this one shows, and and they've never heard of it.

> P1: I talked to the postmaster at the station. He gets all the advisories from the USPS, because it's USPS and then MPS, so it's the MPS, is the military you know, agent form. So they've never seen an advisory. Never heard about it. Completely unfamiliar with Login.gov as a whole, let alone that they're the only authorized agent for in-person verifications. And so yeah, no, nobody, nobody saw it coming.

> P1: I used to have this mantra in the military. I always did as a supervisor education before implementation. That was my mantra, and that's what they've done is they went ahead and implemented it last month. And all these people is, I'm, you know. I'm [number], and I'm a young buck among the retirees. But I'm also, you know, the calm guy. So I'm trying to help people, you know, techno with technical troubleshooting all these workarounds, even just to help them get it, ID me, and see if they can do a video verification.

> P1: But like I said. We've ruled out Login.gov is not an option for any of us, because Post Office is the last option that doesn't work. Nobody's thought about it yet.

> P1: And you know, maybe tweaking their browsers, trying some other options, where again, even the ones that got video verified with ID me still doesn't work, so I'm walking them through. I'll try this browser, and, you know, disable this and clear that, and they still can't logged in, and there's no nobody to turn to, because ID me when they say, Hey, id me! I'm using you to authenticate, and I'm just caught in this endless loop.

> P1: I have also, I have every remote tech support app there is, and I've watched them, and you just see them get caught in this endless loop of trying to authenticate. Get kicked. Kick back. ID me. Go back to VA get kicked back to ID me. Yeah, it's just it's been hopeless.

Becky: Yeah, no. And you know, I really appreciate this feedback, even outside of just the Contact us page. I know we we've been talking about login and authentication to within our office. So I will, we'll definitely share this feedback with, you know the folks that are involved with that process right now. But yeah, it's really kind of you to help, you know your fellow Veterans who are also living abroad, since you seem to have, just unfortunately, a lot of experience with trying to find the right contact information. Yeah. I'll continue moving us along. But we will go through a scenario that maybe is relevant to your experiences with login, and I'll go through that right now.

## Scenarios
Becky: In the rest of the session. I'm going to give you 2 scenarios where you, as a veteran, would reach out to VA for help. So you know, I'd just like to imagine that you're a Veteran in these 2 scenarios. And these are actually real questions that Veterans asked us this year, just reworded.

Becky: So before you do that, I'm going to send a link to the current Contact us page on VA.gov. Yes, in the chat. So let me know when you've received that, and if you can open the link in the chat.

> P1: Okay, I've got that open in Google Chrome.

Becky: Now, second question, have you shared your screen on Zoom before?

> P1: : Yes. But let me see. I have multiple browsers. So yeah.

Becky: Now you can choose the right window, so you don't share your whole screen. And let me know if you need help with that.

> P1: I've been playing in Microsoft Teams for the past 2 weeks. Where do we have it here on Zoom?

Becky: Yes, in Zoom it'll be that green share button. Yes. Yeah, no worries. It's funny how it's very obvious, but not not obvious enough sometimes.

> P1: Got it

Becky: Amazing. Alright. Now let me expand my screen. Okay, now I can see your whole screen. Great. And I'll walk you through our first scenario, which is actually a login scenario.

### Login scenario
Becky: So I'd like you to pretend that you're a Veteran who can't create an account on VA.gov. You are trying to create a Login.gov account. But Login.gov doesn't let you use your passport as a form of identification. And you just don't have your driver's license because you lost it recently. But you still need to create an account.

Becky: So, starting on the Contact us page, which is the page you're on right now show me how you would find help for this scenario. And as you're showing me, tell me what you're thinking and noticing on this page.

Becky: I'll also send this scenario in the chat. So you have it readily on hand in case you need to refer to it. So yeah, again, walk through the page. Tell me how you would try to find help for creating an account for VA.gov, when you only have a passport. You don't have your driver's license.

> P1: Let me, I gotta move my screen around a little bit. Here. Okay, yeah, I just want to say it's when you were talking about, so I can see the chat. I don't see, okay? And they didn't. So I just said, Oh, that's in a group, couldn't imagine somebody trying to do this on a mobile phone or, cause I've got a, so I've got the chat window open separately. And then I've got your video open up in the corner there.

> P1: Okay, back to the screen.

> P1: so just initial, my initial response is, Contact us online through Va, well. I want to see what else, I hate chat bots.

Becky: Sorry. Pausing there. Can you tell me a little bit more about the hate for chat bots?

> P1: Number one, is just because I've been trying them since they were first invented is, I refuse to sit and wait, held hostage by chat bot!

> P1: So it's just kind of like every time I go to walk away. It's like, you know, do you get a repeat of the exact same question. But it's basically what should be if it was a live agent question. Answer, question, answer, chat bot is question, go ahead and start dinner as it could be. 15, 10 min before it comes back.

> P1: And again I know chat bots have advanced considerably. But it seems even what they do now is simulating engagement by just front loading you, whatever it can.

> P1: You know. Do to make you feel like, oh, I'm being there. It's being responsive, and it's helping me, and my experience with them is they just, just a little infuriating, because it's just like, Oh, you want me to keep you. You don't want you don't want to hear my question. You want me to ask the question that matches the answers. So it keeps on trying to change my initial inquiry into here, let me throw some keywords at you, and if any of these keywords work for me, I've got an answer for that.

> P1: So it's like it doesn't necessarily want to try and interpret my question, or I didn't have the right keywords the way I phrased it. So it's kind of like, you know, leading me down this path, that well, I'm going to give you an answer that I already have, because I had this team put together 87 pre-formatted responses. And we're going to force you to accept one of those 87 answers, and we'll try and get as close as we can. So that's why, initially, I'll ignore the chat bot, you know, from the get. Go to see what my other options are.

> P1: Call us, unless I got up really early, and you know, beat the, because of the time  Zone difference is, you know if I can be the first in the queue that day.

> P1: Otherwise I've been on the phone with VA And it's 20, 30, 40 min. A flip of the coin. I get a helpful representative or somebody that's just flipping through the binder looking for, you know. Here, let me send you over here.

> P1: So contact local VA facility. There are no local VA facilities overseas.

> P1: Explore facts and other resources. While again, going with the premise that I'm just slamming on the page for the first time, and I'm trying to create an account, but I don't have the proper IDs.

> P1: I might go there, just as you know. See if there's a workaround for the whole lost my driver's license
 
> P1: Helpful online tools, just kind of feels repetitive. So I would probably jump back up and contact us online to the VA.

Becky: And what do you think that means, contact us online through Ask VA?

> P1: That probably be presented with a contact us form with lots of dropdowns to try and narrow, you know, where it's gonna go to, and sometimes nowadays, they, you know, give you a couple options, text it, and go. Here's the information, you know, before I submit.
 
> P1: So yeah, I just expect, you know, a fairly, not exhaustive, but a fairly detailed contact us form to make sure I'm, you know, focus my question and get it to the right people.

Becky: Is there a reason in particular why you would want to do this channel versus all the other ones first?

> P1: I never just like, you know, do a one-off. I would do like, I will use this to get an idea, or because it's just like on the phone. That's one of the reasons why I hate the phone calls is they often don't say...

> P1: Oh can I cheat and look at the drop down for the callers?

Becky: Oh, yes, yeah. Feel free to interact with the page, too. Yeah.

> P1: Ao here, all that's giving me is the phone number. And what I would want to know is, when calling, we'll need the following information.

> P1: So this came up exactly. This is the exact same thing came up Sunday in our veteran Forum is the gentleman had no idea where his DOD ID number was.

> P1: So he had his social security number, but he had no idea what his DOD ID number was. I said, you know, where's your ID card? Where's I asked him a couple of things, and he says, Well, you know, like the driver's license, "I misplaced my id card."

> P1: It's the only ID. It's the only number, and I'm trying to get from DEERS. But it won't let me log onto the page, using ID me.

> P1: So I said, well, I can't help with ID me and look at all my previous posts.
 
> P1: But you know, certainly you you know. Check your any of your other options, as you know whether it's a hospital visit or the from, see your receipt. Everything's gonna have your DOD id number on it.

> P1: So point of that story is, before calling a number, I would like to know what information I need to have before I can pick up the phone.

> P1: So it just kinda you know, it's because I don't want to, I don't want to sit on hold for 20 min, and have them say, Well, can I, oh, I'll need your case number for that.

> P1: I don't know my case number. Now you're going to make me look up my case number. So I'd rather say, you know, before you call, it will be helpful to have the following information available to, you know, get you to the right department.

> P1: because, you know, they're just assuming they're, they've got, you know, the wizard on the other end of that phone number that automatically knows everything about me.

> P1: And I'm just going to say, oh, my name's [name]. And oh, Hi, [name], yeah, we got you right here.

> P1: Well, there's only 2 of us in the world, so with me it's a safe bet. But for John Smith, he could be there for hours trying to find him. So if there were.

> P1: So my hesitancy with picking up the phone is you don't even know what I'm calling about, so kind of help me out here what I'm going to need before I waste my time sitting on hold only be asked a series of questions

> P1: And maybe it's my spouse. Because my hearing aid batteries died. And now she's holding the phone for me, and she's like, they need to know what your DOD ID number is.

> P1: So all those kind of things, I would want to know before I can pick up the phone. It's like, this is what I need to do in order for them to help me.

Becky: Yeah that's great feedback. I'm curious, you know, on this current page, without that information that you were mentioning about what you might need. How would you go about choosing which phone number to call in this scenario? Walk me through how you're deciding which phone number to call.

> P1: Just, you know, I'm old school. I remember the 411, I would initially, that would be because it's the first number presented. It's 24/7. That would be the first number.

> P1: I don't need teletype benefits hotline.

> P1: I probably, same thing, would probably be working with the VSO. GI Bill hotline, not applicable.

> P1: The other phone numbers again, unless again, depending on, because the, you know, premise of your first question being, you know, I want to sign up, but without, you know, my passport doesn't work, and I lost my driver's license.

> P1: I I probably wouldn't want to go through the full list of helpful VA numbers.

> P1: I'd probably, just like I said, go ahead and fill out a form, then go ahead. But then, that's what I was saying at the onset is, I usually do the webmail form first, because that gets to this whole issue, about which phone number to call

> P1: Once I fill out the form, it's like, Oh, crap! I need my DOD ID number, I might need my, you know, depending on my question. Okay, this really has to do with E benefits. So I might as well get my case number.

> P1: So by filling out the web forms, I get a better idea of what I need to be prepared for to talk to the person on the phone.

> P1: Like I said, it might present me with some drop downs further narrow what my area of interest is. Maybe there's a separate section, just for technical technical support of creating accounts or troubles with logging in. So I would fill out the form.

> P1: But I'm not gonna just walk away and wait for an email response. Then I would pick up the phone.

> P1: And while I was on hold, I'd probably even hit up the chat bot to see what kind of automated response, I'm, you know, that I'm going to get. So I usually take a 2, 3 pronged approach solving this stuff.

Becky: Yeah, you, it sounds like you don't want to put all your eggs in one contact basket, so to speak. I'm really curious if your, this process will change for the next scenario. So I'll go ahead and give that one, too.

### Claims scenario
Becky: So let me find it again, and you can go ahead and maybe refresh your page so that you're, you're right at the top of the page again. I think it should bring you back to the top or, or no, it might not. Yeah, there we go.

Becky: All right, so this is our second and final scenario. So again, you're imagining you're a Veteran and you currently get disability compensation for shoulder pain. And recently you noticed that your shoulder has been hurting more in the past couple of months.

Becky: And so now you're wondering if you can request more compensation for your shoulder pain because it's worse now than when you initially received disability compensation. So again, starting on this page, show me how you would find help for this new scenario. And again, I'm going to send this in the chat so you can refer to it if you need to.

Becky: So I see you you've scrolled down to the the phone numbers. Is that sort of what you would start with first in this claims scenario?

> P1: Well, it's because the starting from the top here, I'm, because obviously if I'm already getting benefits, I'm have a pretty good idea of what I'm looking for. So I wouldn't just, I wouldn't want to just, you know, blindly, you know, yell. Hey, VA, is anybody listening?

> P1: I know that the benefits section is a completely different animal because I've been dealing with, you know, MyHealtheVet and Ebenefits. So it's like I, I know those are like down the pyramid on the VA structure.

> P1: So I'm probably, I'm just gonna scroll past all this initial VA stuff that's for amateurs. I'm a, I'm a seasoned, you know, pro now.

> P1: And so I'm ignoring, you know, that top section again. Now I know it's gonna be benefits related. Don't want to bother with that.

> P1: And no, no, So I see the first VA benefits hotline, and I'm just going to go ahead and keep glancing just for grins and giggles. And there's the health benefits hotline now. Then there's a MyHealtheVet help desk. And now I'm kind of confused as they are three separate numbers.

> P1: And so I'm not really sure why they're spaced so far apart and why they're all different phone numbers when they kind of, but then I go, OK, well, that's the help desk. That's the classic login issue.

> P1: So I'll go back up to the health benefits hotline versus the benefits outline. Now this is my shoulder. So VA benefits that could be burial. So let's go ahead and strictly with VA health benefits. So that's probably the, that's probably out of the all of them.

> P1: I would say, OK, I'll this is, this is the one I want, but they really should capitalize that [the 'H' in the 'VA health benefits' label]. Okay, this is the one I want. But they really should capitalize that 'H.'

Becky: That was really helpful. It sounded like, you know, you reviewed everything. You came down to three phone numbers, but there was still a bit of ambiguity around which one you should select.

Becky: And so then, it sounds like would you call the health benefits hotline? And let's say you don't get your answer there. What would you try to do next?

> P1: Well, I said because of the, I haven't been on the, you know, MyHealtheVet or benefits pages because I know they've been consolidating everything. So assuming, let's see what else?

> P1: So assuming that I already had that sign in active account, I would ignore this page and I just go right to sign in again.

> P1: As I know, I'm usually, at least that gets me into my account, and I can quickly narrow down what, what department of the VA I'll be working with.

Becky: I'm curious, what, what would you, what else would you expect to change after you sign in to VA.gov that you think might help you a bit better in this scenario rather than not being signed in?

> P1: Yeah, just, you know, just thinking 'cause I am a guy that always looks for the contact us page.

> P1: so just in case there's like this, you know, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that there's gonna be lots of options. So rather than me drill through a bunch of other pages, I will go to the contact us, see if what I'm looking for is there. If not, then I'll go back to where I was and see if there's a link. It's more closely related.

> P1: So they're just looking at this, you know, because again, we're at the, you know, top of the domain and VA.gov. So I'm not under VA.gov, you know, benefits or health or anything like that.

> P1: So I know I'm already, so I, I, I already know I'm about top of the chain. It's like, you know, I wanna, I wanna talk to the EPA and I've got the White House. I'm on the White House page. So I'm a little too high up in the chain, you know, to be looking for the best phone number to begin with.

> P1: So, yeah, So from this page, as again, I already know it's gonna be having to do with, you know, increasing my rating. So that's the kind of buzzwords I'm gonna be looking for.

> P1: So at this point, because I didn't find, I didn't see any other than the phone number, nothing, you know, jumped off the page saying, oh, here's a quick online resource.

> P1: So I would probably go back up. Do the explorer facts and other resources get answers to your, to your question.

> P1: So there's check your VA claim or appeal status. That's probably the closest, what I would have to deal with since it's already a A-rated condition.

> P1: So I would look at that one, but then I would also scroll back up and take a look at how far I'm like, oh, that's the same stuff.

Becky: So yeah, feel free to click any links to if you want to navigate to another page, if that's what you would do in this scenario.

> P1: Yeah, let's see, let's see what happens. I’m a tab guy, so I always open it in the next tab just in case it's a bummer tab.

> P1: OK, so check your VA claim decision review or appeal status. And again, as I expected it would, first thing I have to do is I've got to sign in.

> P1: So even though, you know, just the very fact that it's the first thing it presents me with before it starts asking me any questions, I was like, well, I saw that one coming.

Becky: It sounds like you sort of expect to have to sign in to, to do some things on VA.gov.

> P1: The minute you start talking about your case, your specific account, your file, you you have to sign in because otherwise everything is so ambiguous public facing. It's not going to have the very specific things that I'm concerned about.

Becky: Yeah, you, you bring up a really good point because it sounds like you're thinking, OK, this is a personal, this is a very personal question I have related to my own benefits. I'm going to need a sign in to get that answer.

Becky: Going back to the Contact us page too. I'm curious, would you have selected that link to go to the FAQs or, or try to find articles that way or, you know, would you have searched through VA.gov to find more information at this point for this particular scenario?

> P1: No, it's like I said with this, you're a Veteran and you've been through all the initial compensation and pension exams, all of the decision letters, the appeals, it goes on for years. And you and, you know, there's nobody else in the VA you can talk to.

> P1: It's just such a narrow department that those are the only folks you're ever gonna talk to. Nobody else wants to talk to you about it. They're 90% of the answers in the Facebook groups is... They say go contact your local VSO. Go contact your local, you know, here's your VA office. Get them to get you a VSO to work with you.

> P1: So, yeah, it's like everybody, you mentioned anything that's a rated condition or physical health related, go to your account, and you've got to start talking to people that talk that entire C&P language. It's an animal unto itself.

Becky: Got it. That's interesting. And it sounds like, you know, going back to the phone numbers, you'd expect someone on the other end of the VA health benefits hotline to also be knowledgeable about those those C&P questions too, or no?

> P1: You know HIPAA has ruined society as we know it. You know, the minute you know, you know, you know, now the parents can't even ask about their own kids because of HIPAA laws.

> P1: And I just know you can't talk to anybody that is not in that, you know, in that very specific, you know, arena without being, going, jumping through all the hoops of verification and account. And you literally have to have your records right there to prove that's who you are.

> P1: As I know, nobody at any phone number is ever just gonna talk directly to me about my specific, you know, case. They're just gonna give you them the vanilla generic answers that you would have found on Google yourself anyway. I guess they just can't.

Becky: Got it. Yeah that's helpful to understand. I guess your, your expectations for what sort of answers you might receive through like a phone agent again versus maybe logging in and verifying your identity first. Well, that was, yeah, that was all my questions for those two scenarios around login and then this claims related scenarios. So you can go ahead and stop sharing your screen and we'll move on to one of the last parts of this session.

## Review each scenario
Becky: So again, thank you for going through those scenarios with me, especially before that, even sharing your experience with, with creating an account on VA.gov. That was really helpful.

Becky: And before we end, I just wanted to review the different ways the contact us page could have helped in one of those scenarios. So the login one.

Becky: So I'll be doing a walkthrough myself of what you might expect if you had selected those different support channels especially. So I'm hoping this walkthrough helps you as we're improving the page and you've really shown me how finding answers can be really complicated right now. So that's exactly what we're trying to to solve for right now.

[Becky does walk through. See [this section](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/veteran%20support%20crew/Contact%20us%20page/User%20research/09-2024%20Find%20help%20on%20Contact%20us/Conversation%20guide.md#review-login-scenario---10-minutes) in the conversation guide]

#### Contact us online through Ask VA
> P1: Go back to the new inquiry tab and could you humor me and click on next. Yeah, I'm actually most interested in the format for phone numbers.

Becky: I'm curious, are you thinking that it won't accept an international phone number?

> P1: Yeah, we've had, we've had a lot of issues with somebody has put so many restrictions on the characters in the formatting of that field that they can't use plus signs, they can't use stashes, they can't, you know, use parentheses.

> P1: And so many of these folks, they have no idea what character restrictions are within a field, how the field is formatted, and then they don't get the appropriate error messages.

> P1: So the, I always say, you know, the amount of effort you put in, you know, putting a Veteran's daytime phone number, this is like the number one glitch in any page is just show the required format, so they know what the accepted characters and format are.

> P1: Because you know, some of the older folks that you still use parentheses around the area code, they use dashes and, and it's all these stupid little things that are just enough to reject the entire form.

> P1: And they don't get hints as to, you know, it just says, you know, you know, error or, you know, fill their anyway.

> P1: So yeah, I just, I, I deal with this all the time with the, the postal code formatting and the phone number formatting.

> P1: And it's a Wild West of how many times wrapped it gusses to where I 'cause I I can do probably 6 different formats and and it's spin the wheel to figure out which one works.

> P1: So just, so you know for your awareness, that's probably two of the most common complaints is phone number formatting and postal code formatting.

> P1: I think there was some help text here, but how it could be helpful to show the format that we're expecting the the input to me, yeah, 'cause I, I see some of these older retirees and, you know, and they're living off their, you know, 7 inch screen smartphones now.

> P1: And so, you know, for me, I'm always on the PC so I see the full. So it's, it's very easy for me to Scroll down the page and see where one leads to another and, and it's and so I can see the entire page if I have an error or there's a glitch or I see, oh, OK, the country is down here.

> P1: And now when I clicked on country, it just changed the form filled entry, the formatting. Well, that's screwed up. But when they're on their phones or their tablets, they don't see that. And when they get to the bottom, it's just, it's kind of a jumbled mess as they're going back trying to figure out where did I make the mistake. So I, I, I was just wondering why did we make a mistake in the first place 'cause we weren't given a, an option as to what was the required format for the entries?

#### Ask our chatbot a question

> P1: Now is it, do people have a option to get a, where their inquiry if it's incomplete, can be gets forwarded to the correct department or, or get a copy of the transcript so maybe they can see the answers that were given?

> P1: It's like I said, I, I've seen that a lot with, you know, I, I can have 23 tabs open in one of my three browsers. So I never lose track of, you know, what I was looking at previously.

> P1: Like I said, I deal with, it's so frustrating for me when I go to one of the retiree events and everybody's pulling out their phones and there's no searching tabs easily going back and forth.

> P1: So, you know, and they're just as likely to fat finger and close the tab that had all the information they were looking for and they don't have a copy of it. So maybe if there was an option to thanks, send me this information and then enter e-mail.

## Cool down
Becky: As a, as a final question for you, do you have any final thoughts on this process or any any takeaways that I can bring back to my team? Or do you have any questions for me?

> P1: Chomping at the bit, please, for the love of God! Go back to the folks that are working with the verification process. Those of us that had premium accounts on VA had to do that in person. At least I know I did. I had to travel from the UK to Washington DC, go in person, do everything and honest to God, and I'm sorry that anybody that was over 50 or 60 should have been grandfathered.

> P1: None of this ID me, none of this Login.gov, because what was missing on that page that you were just on about requirements. The missing phrase from that is it must be in date to be valid and they don't recognize. So the military, and I've explained this to both login and ID me a bazillion times all the way up the train.

> P1: And I know we're out of time, but the almost every state automatically extends the expiration of your driver's license without any paperwork or anything else, with merely military orders or proof of overseas residency, no questions asked.

> P1: Some states will let you do it for five years, 10 years, some indefinitely, but they will not reissue your license till you return to the state. But your license is still valid and ID me and Login.gov refuse to verify that information, authenticate it.

> P1: And for the most bizarre thing in the entire federal government as that they're all citing US Code 81 I believe, I believe it's 81 inappropriately about the use of military ID cards as a form of legal identity. They're totally misquoting it and misinterpreting it and they refuse to answer the question every time I confront them with the exact text because I was a COMSEC guy.

> P1: I worked with that whole issue of when can you make copies? So I can take a photocopy of my ID and so long as I put I copy across it, it's legal. Completely legal. Both those agencies absolutely refuse and their answer is explicitly because we're not allowed to hold or process a military ID card for authentication, which is an absolute falsehood.

> P1: So both those agencies are screwing over thousands of veterans because they're none of them want to. They're making so much money off these contracts, they're not going to go back and argue with the VA on something that's going to cause them to lose money.

> P1: So, and this is why they always send me go back to the VA. Unless the VA tells them you have to accept a military ID card as proof of identity, they're not gonna do it. And it is and and the military has already decided all of our old style DoD form IDs out the window. We all are mandated.

> P1: We have to get the new CAC style ID cards and the fact that we can't use those for most of these military folks that are retired veterans overseas, it's the only piece of US ID they have left.

Becky: Yeah, I can see how this is, I'm really glad we got a chance to speak because, you know, you definitely provide great perspective from a veteran living abroad rather than someone, you know, in the US who might experience different challenges. So I'll definitely bring that back to the team.

Becky: And you know, I have to go through this transcript to get the exact challenge but, if you were to summarize it, do you think the challenge is just not being able to use the military ID to verify your identity through id.me or login.gov?

> P1: Yes, because again, our Login.gov does not only it's only state IDs. And like I said, even Login.gov does not acknowledge the fact that probably 47 out of the 50 states all have that.

> P1: If you contact every DMV, which login.gov is not gonna do, you contact, contact every DMV does. And again, people say, well, what you can do this? Well, if you're a veteran and you get medically retired overseas, you can be there for six months to three years because you're like me. Because of my mental condition, I can't travel.

> P1: I cannot go back to the states to get a new driver's license and all the while I can't access my VA account to process my claims because they jumped the gun and already locked me out. So I can't even process my claim because the only thing that they'll accept is a non starter.

> P1: I'm supposed to spend $2000 on a special ticket to fly back to Oregon just to get a driver's license to fly all the way back to show them hold up a photo next to them? It's absolutely insane and like I said it completely, it even tell me that it's right in the middle of their claims process because of medical separation or retirement.

> P1: They, if they're and there's a lot of us overseas, this is where we get discharge. We don't get returned to the states. And so yeah, and I know a guy that actually had to move back to Oregon because of that very reason. He moved back two months early, screwed up all of his plans, all simply because he got locked out of the that part of his account for me right now.

> P1: They and I know we went over, I cannot, I can't change my my direct deposit forever. And you know, they said, well, you can call and he's like, but this is the whole point is now you're saying I could be Joe Schmo on a phone call, but oh, by God, if I log into my account, I'm a Russian hacker. So nothing required for a phone call.
 
> P1: You know, that they're making me go through these ridiculous hurdles just because I have access to a computer. So there's no so there's no consistency there. Phone call, just we don't they don't know what I sound like. They dont. I could be, I pretend to be my 80, 89 year old mom all the time. Never have been stopped. But you know, but yeah, anyway, you got the point.

Becky: I can, you know, you're, this is the sense we get a lot from Veterans as well. And why, why it's so helpful to have these sessions. But we definitely don't want to make it so you have to jump through crazy hoops to just access your account or fill out a form or whatever the task it may be that you're trying to do on va.gov. So I definitely hear you. Iwould similarly be very frustrated and would not want to travel, you know, hundreds of miles just to do this this one thing. 

Becky: So, you know, like I said, I'll relay this to specifically our login team, but at least for the purpose of today's session too, I definitely got a lot of good feedback for the contact us page.

Becky: So yeah, I really appreciate your time. And, you know, thanks so much for giving your honest, unfiltered feedback. That's that's what we're here for.
