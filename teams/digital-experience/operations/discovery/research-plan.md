# Research Plan for Infrastructure Overhaul Discovery Sprint, January 2020 [DRAFT]

## Goals	
1. This discovery research is part of the Discovery Sprint for the Operations team on the Veteran Services Platform (VSP).
2. Background: This project initiated on the idea that the current technical infrastructure built and maintained by VSP will not be able to scale to support many more VFS teams building on VA.gov. The Operations team has a broad sense of the pain points that developers currently experience when building on VA.gov, but aims to validate its assumptions with current VFS team developers do thoroughly understand the problem in order to recommend solutions and prioritize them on the team's roadmap.
3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	
4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	
## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  - We are planning to conduct live, moderated, directed interviews with participants.
  - We will meet with participants remotely via Zoom.
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	
  - We do not yet have any processes or interfaces for the participants to test, and want to focus on discovery to gain a deep understanding of their experiences working with the platform infrastructure.
  - We will use a conversation guide to structure the discussion, but may occasionally deviate from the script to pursue a line of thought or idea.
3.	Where are you planning to do your research? Zoom
4.	What will you be testing? Nothing! This will be an interview rather than a usability test.
5.  If remote: Zoom
## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)	
2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
(If in person, describe how you will find participants. If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract or if there are other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project. If you need help, please contact UX lead.)	
## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 	
2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	
3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours) 	
4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.	
5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	
## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work**
