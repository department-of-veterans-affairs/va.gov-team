# Component Library Product Outline

## Overview

The Design System Team mission statement is to provide simple, scalable, high quality tools and guidelines that enable teams to rapidly build and improve the Veteran facing digital applications provided by VA. One of the products the DST supports is the component library which is used by VFS team to use to design, test and build digital applications.

## Problem Statement

The Design System Team believes that improving consistency by identifying and communication of a “source of truth” version for components will increase the number of new or variant components which will benefit all teams. We believe that VFS teams are confused by inconsistencies across the design system documentation, tools, and production applications.

How might we provide a “source of truth” version for components to increase the number of new or variant components launched and help us track the actual usage of components across applications.

## Personas

VFS Teams (developers and designers)

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

* Increased usage of components within the design system component library
* Reduced variations of components
* 

#### Baseline KPI Values

* Number of components from the component library that are used in production

---

## Assumptions

- We assume that if we provide a "source of truth" version of components, there will be an increase in components launched 

## Solution Approach

_Describe, in a few sentences and/or bullet points, what you plan to build, and how it will solve the problem. Some questions to think about:_

- We will continue to add new components and update components in the DS component library

- We will begin builiding components as a single source of truth for multiple technical environments (web components)

  

_For non-trivial technical solutions, an [engineering design doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/engineering/design-docs) should be written to deeply explain **How** this product will be built._
