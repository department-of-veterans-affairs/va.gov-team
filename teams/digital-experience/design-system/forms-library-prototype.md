# Build a New Forms Library Prototype

## Overview

Currently the forms library tries to do everything and is not flexible which results in work arounds or hacks to accommodate other use cases. The Design System Team would like to work on a prototype of a new forms library and partner with a VFS team who is working on a form to find out if we could make a forms library that is easier to use and helps teams to build forms more faster. 


## Problem Statement

The Design System Team mission is to "Provide simple, scalable, high quality tools and guidelines that enable teams to rapidly build and improve the Veteran facing digital applications provided by VA."  We believe that VFS teams are not designing and building forms efficiently because the forms library is not flexible so requires a lot of work arounds. We believe that improving form-related components and pattern documentation will improve the time from launch to production for form applications.



## Personas

VFS teams 

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

* Reduced modifications to a form pattern 
* Reduced development time to build a form 
* Reduced time spent on forms library support 


#### Baseline KPI Values

* Time it takes to build a form (basic form for comparison)
* Number of support tickets are related forms library 
* Number of one-time use configurations

## Assumptions

- There will be less complexity to the forms library because it will be easier to use, more flexible and modular. 
- There will be sess risk when we want to make a change to the forms library. Currently, we do not have high confidence that there won't be bad side effects. 
- If the forms library is easier to use,  developers and designers are more likely to contribute to the design system.



## Solution Approach

_Describe, in a few sentences and/or bullet points, what you plan to build, and how it will solve the problem. Some questions to think about:_

- We will build a prototype of a new forms library
- We will parterner with  VFS team who is building a form and work with them to build a prototype of a single form
- Working with a VFS team who will use the prototype to build a form will help us determine the feasibility of a new system. Will it be better than existing system 


_For non-trivial technical solutions, an [engineering design doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/engineering/design-docs) should be written to deeply explain **How** this product will be built._
