## Overview
The Design System Team mission statement is to provide simple, scalable, high quality tools and guidelines that enable teams to rapidly build and improve the Veteran facing digital applications provided by VA. Currently the established form patterns are not documented or are documented poorly. 


## Problem Statement
As stated above, the existing patterns in the forms library either aren't documented at all or arenâ€™t well documented. This problem has resulted in the following:

- VFS engineers encountering challenges when implementing and/or VFS designers creating new patterns.  
- VSA team has created their own documentation for form patterns which is  internal to their own team. 
- The lack of documentation leads to a knowledge gap between designers and developers and wasted time spent on designing and building a form pattern that already exists. 
- Current form templates are out of date 


## Desired User Outcomes
With established form patterns documented, designers and developers will able to identify which form meets their product requirements instead of building a form pattern that already exists.. 

## Undesired User Outcomes


## Desired Business Outcomes
With established form patterns documented VFS teams will enable VFS teams to build applications faster. 

## Undesired Business Outcomes


## Assumptions
- Developers and designers are not finding and using established forms because there is either no or scant documentation. 
- VFS Teams are building new applications with forms that are in the forms library. 


- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumtion w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach
- Identify which form patterns are missing documentation or have inadequate documentation
- Add documentation to the form patterns 


## KPIs
- Reduction in the time it takes for a designer to produce a prototype of a form
- Increase reusable form library patterns by 10
