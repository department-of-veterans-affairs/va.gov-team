## Key Takeaways

### 1. People feel supported and confident during and immediately after onboarding sessions, but it begins to feel overwhelming when they are on their own.

77% of the responses to the following question were positive in nature:

_The content of the kickoff meeting felt..._

> nice & informative.

> perfect to drive next steps

> well structured and organized

> buttery smooth

A few weeks after teams completed onboarding, when asked what the biggest challenges were during onboarding, the responses expressed feeling overwhelmed, confused, and lost with the documentation: 

> DELUGE of information, provided in so many different places.

> I received a lot of information in multiple meetings but it was confusing how it all went together. I think the kickoff meeting could have provided more clarity.

> It was all there, but not knowing what a lot of it meant, by the time you need to actually use the information you can't remember where it was located in the documentation.

A few notable responses to the question, "Now that you’ve started working on VA.gov, what were you missing during onboarding that would have made the transition smoother?"

> Honestly, I still feel like I don't have everything I need. I was only able to attend some of the onboarding due to the other project's start. Onboarding to Ad Hoc, the program, and projects all at the same time, there's a tornado of information. Each would benefit from a complete onboarding document, but I also recognize the challenges.

> Deeper dives to include more GitHub and pull requests training.

> A simple list of the tasks we were asked to do showing why and where it fit in to the big picture. Documentation was thorough and very helpful if you could find it. It was very difficult to find the documentation you were looking for in Git.

> Need to streamline the info a little better for clear communication and expectations across teams.

> It would be helpful to explain in onboarding that the process can take a while and it's understood there is not going to be a quick flow of work when first starting. It's sometimes hard to know if there is work one should be doing or if it's just a matter of waiting till everyone is fully onboarded.

### 2. The learning curve is steep for developers.

For devs who haven't worked on the VA.gov platform before, it takes a long time before they feel they can work at their normal pace. They needed to start contributing to their projects faster than they were able to completely finish setting up their machines and learning necessary processes. 

Here are some of the responses to the question asked post-onboarding, _"Are there processes you don’t fully understand? If so, which ones?_"

> Setting up my dev environment — but I hope to do that after this next sprint, or in a lull during it, and have a fellow dev to assist if needed.

> most people still do not know how to do pull requests and how they are done and what needs to be reviewed, etc.

> End-to-end testing, approvals. **Since I'm just now getting the code close to being ready I'm nervous about going through whatever the rest of the process is.** **It wasn't clear to me from onboarding. Again, I think you have to go through it at least once before it will make sense. I think an experienced person should pair-program with a new person for 100% of their first project, start-to-finish.**

> Pull request creation

> Google Analytics, 508 accessibility, the correct order of issues/PRs/documentation when creating a new branch of a page.

> **You should not have to do your first project alone and be expected to ask questions on Slack and know what to ask and who to ask.** You should be paired with an experienced engineer (peer) who will work the entire project with you from start-to-finish and show you each step of the processes and help you do the first one. After that you should be fine.

> There are a lot of tickets in validate on our zenhub board because no one knows who or how to review code.

### 3. We made a lot of adjustments to onboarding based on By Light's experience.

- Introduced pre-onboarding steps
- Eventually retired the Discovery and Logistics workshop because most of that content was covered by the pre-onboarding meetings
- Introduced the Vagrant box made for GFEs to run a Linux environment
- Introduced more topical breakout sessions

What adjustments have we made based on VAOS and VSA's experiences?

### 4. VFS teams embrace interdisciplinary training

Some VSA engineers were mistakenly invited to the weekly content, research, and design meeting. One continues to attend and has learned valuable information, especially from Trevor about 508 resources. 

From content writers who attended the Privacy, Security, and Load Testing training: 

> Not my area, but it's good to have insight into dev goals for load tests.

> I'm not an API engineer so I don't know if I'll write a load test, but I'm glad I won't be clueless if asked about it!

#### How might we...
- Encourage interdisciplinary training among VFS teams, to test the hypothesis that it will foster user-centered design culture and adoption of our processes?
- Lower/shorten the learning curve for developers new to VA.gov?
- Continue to iterate the ways we support fully onboarded teams?
- Incorporate surveys into all of the breakout sessions so that we can get more feedback to iterate our materials? (508, analytics, content & IA)
