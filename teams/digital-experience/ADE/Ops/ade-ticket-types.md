# ADE Ticket Types

## ADE Intake Requests

This is [the intake tickets through which VFS teams request ADE support](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?template=Accessibility-Digital-Experience-Intake-Ticket.md). The intake may be created by a VFS team or by a member of ADE on behalf of VFS teams. This intake ticket is the parent and will contain all the work relating to this request.

* During refinement ADE will create/attach child tickets to capture individual support tasks needed. This is typically done by Delivery Lead or Team Lead.   
* ADE SMEs will use the intake ticket to communicate with the product team/stakeholder and share any deliverables.


  
## ADE Research Intake  
[This is the initial ticket for teams to request collaboration with ADE on research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?template=Accessibility-Digital-Experience-Intake-Ticket.md)

* This ticket can be opened as a standalone ticket, or be opened after or during an intake request.  
* ADE will attach new research work tickets to capture individual support tasks needed, based on the selections made in the research ticket. This is typically done by Delivery Lead or Team Lead.   
* Pilots: If a pilot is requested, ADE will [create a research pilot ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?template=ADE-internal-Research-Pilot-Ticket.md) to this research ticket.  
* [Research support child tickets](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?template=ADE-internal-research-refined-ticket-template.md) will be created (based on the tasks required):  
  * Review Research Materials  
  * Provide Technical Support  
  * Help with Research Sessions  
* Research Feedback: If AT research support takes place, a [research child feedback ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?template=ADE-internal-research-accessibility-feedback-issue-quantification.md) will be opened by ADE for each issue found, and attached to the main research ticket (see process below). This is to quantify issues found.


### Child Ticket Creation Workflow for ADE Research 
The child ticket creation workflow for issues found during pilots and research sessions.

1\. Share Feedback: Ensure that you share feedback with the research team during the session via the [Slack Feedback Channel](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C40B45NJK) or preferred method communicated by the research team (eg. Mural, Google Doc, etc.)  
2\. Track Research: Verify that the [research tracker is updated](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/digital-experience/ADE/Ops/ade-tickets-and-how-to-use-them.md#:~:text=Update%20the-,research%20tracker,-with%3A) with:
* the details of the study (tech, skill, device, etc.)  
* the number of accessibility issues identified (columns L-S).

3\. Generate Tickets: If any issues were found, create connected child tickets using the ADE [Research Feedback template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?template=ADE-internal-research-accessibility-feedback-issue-quantification.md)
* Ensure that this child has the label ADE Research Feedback, by default.

4\. Close Tickets: Close the child tickets after connecting them to the research intake.  
Please fill all fields in the GitHub ticket (originator team, closed date, sprint, etc) before closing. Ref. Closing Tickets Section  
5\. Track Closed Tickets: Ensure all the tickets you closed and all of the ticketâ€™s relevant information are entered into the closed tickets tracker in the sheet for the appropriate sprint.

## ADE Work Ticket  
These are sub-issues/child tickets created by ADE.

* Child tickets are created for each type of service requested in the main intake, based on the [ADE menu of services](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/digital-experience/ADE/readme.md#services-we-offer).

> [!NOTE]
> ### Ticket Creation Automation
> When an ADE ticket is created it automatically assigns Lakwi, Sara and Martha and applies the `ADE` label.
> - This label is vital, it triggers GitHub Projects to pull the ticket into ADE's GHP views, adding it to our project.
>     - A ticket must have the `ADE` label and live in the Accessibility DE Project, to become visible to the ADE Team.
>     - The `ADE Intake` label is only present on parent tickets aka intakes aka epics.
>     - Upon the initial ticket save, the `New Intakes` [lane on the main board](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/1597/views/1) is set.
