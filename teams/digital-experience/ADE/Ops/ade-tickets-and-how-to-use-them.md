## ADE Github Terms and Definitions
- **Table content:** The following table covers common terms used by ADE and their definitions. 
- **Table organization:** They are ordered from high-level information to more granular information.


### Process Terms
| **Term** | Definition |
|------------------------|------------------|
| **GHP**                   |    The abbreviation for GitHub Projects, where the ADE team manages their work.| 
| **Repository**                   |     A place where a project’s files, version history, and resources live. ADE operates in the VA.gov-team repository.| 
| **Pipeline**                   |     **A pipeline is a collection, or series of workflows, that defines the status of work being done at a given point in the workflow process.** <li>The ADE Pipeline consists of distinct stages that help define the status of work, while it is with our team. <li>The starting point for our pipeline is `New Intakes` and the end point is `Closed`.  |
| **Refinement**                   |     The process of reviewing and assessing tickets in various stages of the ADE pipeline (New Intakes , Backlog, Blocked, Icebox, etc.) in an effort to progress them through the pipeline to a `Closed` status. | 
| **Ticket Status** | Dictates the swim lanes for the pipeline. <li>Review the [ticket statuses used by ADE](#Ticket-Status) | 
| **Swim Lanes** | The grouping of a similar ticket status for pipeline management. | 
| **Templates** |  Templates have been created for VFS Teams and internal ADE use to organize our work.<li>Refer to [Work Ticket Templates](#Work-Ticket-Templates) for more information | 


### Workflow Terms  
| **Term** | Definition |
|------------------------|------------------|
| **Intake**                 | **A request from a VFS product team or stakeholder for ADE support, which will be broken down into individual work tickets.** <li>ADE selects the issue type “Epic” for these intakes, to group the work by issue type. <li>Intakes are also known as “parent tickets.” <li>Every intake has a quick summary at the top, for a quick high-level overview of what is enclosed. |
| **Ticket**                   | **Ticket(s) are created based on the issue(s) presented by the VFS Team.** <li>Tickets contain the details of the issue and the steps “tasks” (or work) required to meet the acceptance criteria, which is the definition of done. <li>Every ticket has a quick summary at the top, for a quick high-level overview of what is enclosed.<li>**Multiple Tickets:** If the work needing to be done to support the intake ticket is elaborate, multiple tickets may be created to support each portion of the work. <li>**Single Tickets:** If the work is simple and straightforward,one ticket (or potentially more) will be generated to support that work. |
| **Task**                   |     **In Github, a task is an individual work item that can be checked off when completed. Tasks can be used as a simple checklist and/or converted into issues or sub-issues.** <li> **Unchecked Task:** When a task is unchecked, it is open. <li>**Checked Task:** When it is checked, it is closed. <li>**Task Progress:** GHP will show the number of tasks completed in an issue, and the overall progress at the top of the parent ticket. <li>**Lists:** You can also use multiple task lists in one ticket for different parts of your project. In any given ticket there will always be at least two task lists, an ADE Internal Task list and a task list for the VFS Team to complete.  |
| **Sub-Issues**                   | **It is important to show connectivity between tickets.** This can be done through sub-issues.[^1] <li>**Existing Issues:** To connect an existing issue, as a sub-issue, choose the drop-down from "create sub-issue" and select "add existing issue" <li>**New Issues:** To connect a new issue,as a sub-issue, choose the drop-down from "create sub-issue" and select "create sub-issue," and select the respective template. |


### Assets & Reporting Terms  
| **Term** | Definition |
|------------------------|------------------|
| **Supporting Artifacts**                   | Tickets also request supporting artifacts. ADE needs teams to include artifacts like product outlines, user flows, mockups and prototypes with links to screens/boards/sections to look at, in addition to user accounts for the scenarios provided to test. |
| **Titles**                   | **The title section will always begin with the following naming convention: `[ADE xyz]`.** <li>This is used to distinguish the ticket type, followed by the team name, product and the service being provided. <li>It is good to keep the title brief (if possible) and include the name of the tool/product for easier scanning. <li>Consistency is also helpful. <li>Refer to the[ Work Ticket Template section](#Work-Ticket-Templates), for suggested naming conventions.|
| **Labels**                   | Sometimes refered to as tags. These allow for ADE to 'tag' which discipline needs to be involved with the work. [Current source of truth for labels relating to ADE](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/labels?page=1&q=ADE) <li>Refer to the [Labels section](#Labels), for more information.|
| **Fields** | GHP Data that is important for filtering and tracking issues within the ADE pipeline. <li>Refer to the [Custom Ticket Fields section](#Custom-Ticket-Fields) for more information. | 



[^1]: **Discontinued Feature:** It is important to note that related tickets are no longer being tracked via “task lists in markdown,” due to GitHub's planned depreciation of “Task Lists” (April 2025). Instead, related tickets will be connected to tickets via "sub-issues".




## Ticket Types

**There are three main types of tickets.** [^2] 
1. ADE Intake Requests
2. ADE Work Ticket
3. ADE Research Ticket

[^2]: **Anchor links and collapsed sections:** Anchor links will not activate on a collapsed details section, unless it is expanded on the page. In this example, be sure to expand the collapsed details section "Expand to view xyz." 

<details><summary>Expand to view descriptions of the three main ticket types.</summary>
    
### ADE Intake Requests
[This is the intake for teams to request collaboration with ADE](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?template=Accessibility-Digital-Experience-Intake-Ticket.md).
- During refinement, ADE will attach new work tickets to capture individual support tasks needed.
- You will use the intake ticket to communicate with the product team/stakeholder and share any deliverables.
    - This intake ticket becomes the container for all the work that takes place, relating to this request. 
### ADE Work Ticket
These are ticket sub-issues created by ADE.
- These are based on an intake or stakeholder request stemming from our "menu" of [services we offer](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/digital-experience/ADE/readme.md#services-we-offer).
    - Our menu outlines the specific work needed from an individual contributor (we have also called these "child" or "task" tickets).
        - Product teams can see work tickets attached to their intake, but these work tickets are for you to use.
        - You can add notes in comments and checklists to help you track your progress and move the ticket wherever in belongs in the status swim lanes described below.
### ADE Research Ticket
[This is the initial ticket for teams to request collaboration with ADE on research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?template=Accessibility-Digital-Experience-Intake-Ticket.md)
- This ticket can be opened as a standalone ticket, or be opened **after** or **during** an intake request
- **Refinement**:
    - During refinement, ADE will attach new research work tickets to capture individual support tasks needed, based on the selections made in the research ticket.
        - **Pilots**:
            - If a pilot is requested, ADE will attach [a research pilot ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?template=ADE-internal-Research-Pilot-Ticket.md) to this research ticket.
        - **Support Tasks**:
            - [Research support child tickets](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?template=ADE-internal-research-refined-ticket-template.md) will be spun up based on the tasks needed:
                - Review Research Materials
                - Provide Technical Support
                - Help with Research Sessions
        - **Research Feedback**:
            - If AT research support takes place, [a research child feedback ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?template=ADE-internal-research-accessibility-feedback-issue-quantification.md) will be opened by ADE for each issue found, and attached to the main research ticket. This is to quantify issues found.
            - Refer to the following section on research child tickets aka research "sub-issue(s)" for more information. 

#### Child Ticket Creation Workflow for ADE Research
The following is the child ticket creation workflow for issues found during pilots and research sessions.

##### 1. Share Feedback:
- Ensure that you share feedback with the research team during the session via the [Slack Feedback Channel](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C40B45NJK) or preferred method communicated by the research team (eg. Mural, Google Doc, etc.)
##### 2. Track Research:
- Update the [research tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IBt-C2nXK9uDMPvFdQ_SEEx6WNJ8ms3gKVkuEVlns0U/edit?gid=2141787939#gid=2141787939) with:
    - the details of the study (tech, skill, device, etc.)
    - the number of accessibility issues identified (columns L-S).
##### 3. Generate Tickets:
- If any issues were found, create a child ticket “sub-issue” and connect it to the research intake, for each issue.
    - Use the [new template provided for ADE Research Feedback](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?template=ADE-internal-research-accessibility-feedback-issue-quantification.md).
    - This should have the label `ADE Research Feedback`, by default.
##### 4. Close Tickets:
- Close the child tickets after connecting them to the research intake.
    - Please fill all fields in the GitHub ticket (originator team, closed date, sprint, etc) before closing. [Ref. Closing Tickets Section](#Closing-Tickets)
##### 5. Track Closed Tickets:
- Ensure all the tickets you closed and all of the ticket’s relevant information are entered into the closed tickets tracker in the sheet for the appropriate sprint.

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> ### Ticket Creation Automation
> When an ADE ticket is created it automatically assigns Lakwi, Sara and Martha and applies the `ADE` label.
> - This label is vital, it triggers GitHub Projects to pull the ticket into ADE's GHP views, adding it to our project.
>     - A ticket must have the `ADE` label and live in the Accessibility DE Project, to become visible to the ADE Team.
>     - The `ADE Intake` label is only present on parent tickets aka intakes aka epics.
>     - Upon the initial ticket save, the `New Intakes` [lane on the main board](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/1597/views/1) is set.
> #### ADE Notifications
> - New intake tickets are also part of a Slack/GitHub integration, where a message is sent to the ADE team in DSVA Slack, by GitHub, notifying the entire team a new intake has arrived.
> - This increases visibility for the team, and OCTO, for awareness and prioritization, prior to refinement.
> - This is also used as the primary ticket thread for discussions in Slack.


## Work Ticket Templates

We use templates to make it easier to create tickets for specific kinds of work we do on a regular basis. 

> [!TIP]
> ### Template Access
> [Access all of the templates for the va.gov-team repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new/choose).
> - Search on the term `ADE` to locate ADE-specific templates.
> - ADE templates will include the term `internal` if they are for use by the ADE team only.
> - All templates for ADE include a brief description.
> - Refer to this repository, as the source of truth for VA templates.[^3]

[^3]: **Avoiding Stale Templates:** If a template is linked with a relative URL, piping in fields for assignees for example, any changes to the template fields for assignees will not be reflected in this link. Therefore, when linking to the template, it is best to link to the template's name. **Example**: `?template=Accessibility-Digital-Experience-Intake-Ticket.md`

## Custom Ticket Fields
This section contains field data that is important for filtering and tracking issues within the ADE pipeline. [^2] 
- Required Fields
- Additional Fields

<details><summary>Expand to view descriptions of the custom ticket fields.</summary>
    
### Required Fields
- **Opened Date**: The date the ticket was created.
    - This is auto-generated by GitHub, but it is not auto-generated in GHP.
    - This date should match the auto-generated open date at the top of the ticket in GitHub.
- **Closed Date**: The date the ticket was closed.
    - This is auto-generated by GitHub, but it is not auto-generated in GHP.
    - This date should match the auto-generated closed date at the top of the ticket in GitHub.
- **Estimate**: The level of effort we think will be required for a ticket.
    - Level of effort is determined using basic t-shirt sizing, based on the time it would take to complete the work itself (not including waiting on SMEs or stakeholders, back and forth with OCTO, etc.):
        - **Small**: 1 to 5 days
        - **Medium**: 2 to 4 weeks
        - **Large**: 1 to 3 months
        - **Actual**: How much effort was required, once we've completed the work and can asses how big a lift it was.
        - **Originator/Team**:[The team or stakeholder that requested the work](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/1597/settings/fields/164855280) [^4]

### Additional Fields
- **Assignees** - Shows who is responsible for the work being done on the ticket. This should be used only for the person actively working on the ticket, not for general awareness (if you need to flag a ticket for someone's awareness, tag them in a comment). As a ticket moves through the work process, the assignee may change.

- **Last Checked** - (required) the last time a ticket was checked, especially helpful to track on tickets in backlog or blocked to ensure tickets do not go stale in the pipeline
- **Target date** - (optional) It has been used to track both product team launch dates and general internal ADE deadlines.
- **Priority** - Set by Martha, used to indicate how urgent a piece of work is based on the following scale:
    - **High** - top priority, work should begin immediately
    - **Medium** - important but not as urgent as high priority
  	- **Normal** - default, regular priority
  	- **Low** - not urgent, does not require immediate work. This can be used for items in backlog without current work or actionable next steps. It can also be used for items that can be worked on slowly as time and capacity allows (formerly known as a "chipper"), i.e. long-term initiatives or items with no fixed deadline.
- **OKR** - Set by Martha, used to indicate the primary OKR the ticket is supporting. 
- **Sprint** - (required if being worked on or known)Used for planning when the work in this ticket should be scheduled
- **Blocked by** - used to indicate which OCTO crew is blocking the work
- **Reason Blocked** - general text field to  add detail to the reason the ticket is blocked
- **Milestone** - not currently used by ADE, these are another way of grouping work and tracking progress
- **Linked pull requests** - not used
</details>

## Labels
Sometimes refered to as tags. These allow for ADE to 'tag' which discipline needs to be involved with the work. [Current source of truth for labels relating to ADE](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/labels?page=1&q=ADE)  [^2]

## Ticket Status
The ticket status shows where work is in the ADE pipeline and provides an overview of what's actually happening across the team. The status corresponds to which swim lane the ticket will appear in on the main [Task Table](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/1597/views/8?sliceBy%5Bvalue%5D=New+Intakes)view in Github Projects. Additional GHP views have been and can be created using ticket status. They can be sliced, grouped or filtered using ticket status.

<details><summary>Expand to view descriptions of the ticket status fields.</summary>

  -  **New Intakes** - this is where all new work comes into the board. When you create a ticket and add the ADE label, it will automatically appear here.
  -  **Intakes in Refinement** - Intakes that have been viewed by the Delivery Lead but need more followup (feedback from OCTO, additional information from the requesting team, etc.)
  -  **Intakes in Progress** - Intakes where work has started and work tickets are moving through the swimlanes.
  -  **Ready** - issues have been refined, have next steps and is ready for a SME to grab and begin work on. 
  -  **In Progress** - your current workload, things that you are actively focused on in the current week or two.
  -  **Backlog/Blocked Intakes** - Intakes where work has stopped or been deprioritized.
  -  **Closed** - all the work tickets related to the intake are complete, so the intake has been closed.
  -  **Icebox** - issues that have been deprioritized with no clear timeline or next steps. These are tickets we will only check on a quarterly or yearly basis, so if you anticipate action sooner than that, or need to keep a closer eye on the issue and check it more frequently, better to keep it in Backlog or Blocked.
  -  **Backlog** - issues that are not currently being worked on, but are still relevant and should be pulled in in the foreseeable future
  -  **Blocked** - issues where work has been stopped for more than a week or two. This includes any ticket where the next step belongs to a person that is external to ADE:
     - Tickets that need a decision or review from a stakeholder/SME or OCTO PO
     - Tickets where artifacts required to complete work are missing or incomplete
     - Tickets that are blocked by normal pipeline process steps. For example, a piece of work going through the Collaboration Cycle that is waiting on a product team to finish research before we can help them make changes. There’s no blocker we need to remove, we’re just waiting for it to come back to us.
     - Leave yourself assigned  so you can pick them up when they come back to you!
   -  **Closed** - work completed for this issue, feedback or deliverables have been provided to the team.
  - **OCTO** - tickets created by OCTO leadership - usually audit work
</details>

## Closing Tickets
The way we close tickets matters in our reporting. There are multiple steps outlined below, due to the range of ticket types and discipline areas we cover.  [^2] 
- [Documentation](#Documentation)
- [GitHub Project Fields](#GitHub-Project-Fields)
- [GitHub Labels](#GitHub-Labels)
- [Feedback Survey](#Feedback-Survey)

> [!TIP]
> Be sure to move your ticket to `closed` during or by the end of the sprint in which the work was completed.
> - The sprint should be listed as well in the GHP sprint field.
> - If you don't end up closing a ticket, you will want to adjust the sprint in the ticket.
> - Use this [GHP view of open past, current and next sprints](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/1597/views/45), to adjust any open tickets to the correct sprint.

### Closure Process for ADE Team Members

<details><summary>Expand to review the detailed ticket-closing process.</summary>
    
#### Documentation
- [x] **GitHub**: Confirm that all work tickets attached to an intake are closed
    - [x] If a ticket is not ready for closure, add a comment explaining why and next steps [^5]
        - [x] Next, move the ticket to an active status swimlane (such as `In Progress` or `Blocked`)
- [x] **Spreadsheet**: Add closed intakes and their attached work tickets to the [ADE Closed Tickets spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IBt-C2nXK9uDMPvFdQ_SEEx6WNJ8ms3gKVkuEVlns0U/edit?gid=860336617#gid=860336617) in the relevant sprint tab.
    - [x] Complete all columns [^4]
    - [x] Martha will complete the applicable OKR column

#### GitHub Project Fields
We want to make sure that all of the GitHub Project fields are updated/completed when closing a ticket. Those fields currently include (and are subject to change): 
- **Status**: Closed
- [**Originator/Team**](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/1597/settings/fields/164855280)[^4]
- **Open Date** (the date the ticket was opened)
- **Closed Date** (the date the ticket is being closed)
- **Estimate** (estimated work effort needed to complete this ticket)
- **Actual** (actual work effort utilized to complete this ticket)
- **Priority** (should be set by Martha)
- **OKR** (should be selected by Martha)
- **Sprint** (you are closing the ticket)
- **Last checked**(update throughout the ticket's lifespan and upon closing)
The ticket in GitHub proper should reflect as closed as well, in addition to the status in GHP.[^5]

[^4]: **Missing Team:** If a team is missing from GitHub's `originator/team` field drop-down or from the ADE Closed Tickets Spreadsheet originator/team drop-down field, please let us know, and we can add that team and update our team tracking sheet as well. VFS Teams are constantly changing, so please relay this information as soon as it becomes available. 

#### GitHub Labels 

When closing we will want to make sure the tickets have the appropriate labels for reporting, in addition to filtering, sorting, slicing, grouping, etc. in GitHub. Access the **ADE Label Source of Truth** by [searching for labels with the term: ADE in GitHub](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/labels?q=ADE). All ADE labels will begin with the acronymn ADE. 

### Feedback Survey
When closing a ticket with a VFS Team, please add a link to our feedback survey in the comments and/or in the team's Slack channel.

- **Purpose**: This survey is sent out to teams after we work with them to gather feedback on the accessibility support they received. This will help us track what's working well and what improvements we can make to our processes.
-** Participant Requirements:** Any team that has worked with a Accessibility Digital Experience (ADE) team specialist through an official ADE ticket.

#### Ticket Comment Example

> **We want to hear how your experience has been, so far, working with us!**
> - We are working to better understand **_how our accessibility support has helped_** advance your team's accessibility initiatives.
> - We would also like to know **_what we can do to improve in the future_**.
> 
> Your feedback matters, and it will help us to both confirm and shape our processes moving forward.

[^5]: **Tickets on Multiple GHP Boards:** For tickets that are shared across multiple GHP boards, there are some automation considerations. When closing the ticket via the "close issue" button (located under the comments) it changes the ticket from open to closed. This closes the ticket on every, board that is attached to the ticket, because it is the official GitHub state. Flipping the status from "in progress" to "closed" for example, within the ADE GitHub project board dropdown, will only impact our GHP views., thus keeping the ticket open for others, and us "technically" in GitHub. When all teams are done on the ticket, someone (from any team) can close out the ticket officially. While open, this ticket will not show on our GitHub API export as closed, it will show as open.
