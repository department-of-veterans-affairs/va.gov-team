# Research Plan for 2025-10 Save in Progress -- 2nd round of usability testing

## Background üèóÔ∏è
Saving in-progress work while filling out an online form is an interaction for which the current implementation on VA.gov has known accessibility issues, and the revised design that was [usability tested in May 2025](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/digital-experience/ADE/research/2025-05-save-in-progress/research-report.md) didn't work very well. Key findings from that study indicated that most participants didn't know that their information was being saved automatically, and they didn't see or remember either of the informational alerts about saving. 

This research is being planned to get user feedback on a revised design that hopefully communicates more effectively to Veterans that the information they enter into forms will be saved automatically. The new design adds an [interstitial page (in Figure 1 below)](#user-content-figure-1-shows-the-new-interstitial-page) about saving that appears after the user first clicks the Continue button on the first page of form fields, which is after they've started filling out the form and during a natural pause (between form pages) in their work.

### Figure 1 shows the new interstitial page

### [OCTO-DE Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md) 

This research supports the following OCTO priorities:

Objective 1:  VA‚Äôs digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.
- Key Result 1: Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.

### [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

Veterans may use web forms on VA.gov throughout ALL stages of the Veteran Journey--Serving and separation, Living civilian life, and Retiring and aging.

## Research Goals ü•Ö	

### Goals

1. See if Veterans understand that their form data is being saved as they're filling out a form but haven't submitted it yet.
1. See if Veterans can stop filling out a form, get signed out, and then resume filling out a form.
1. See if moving the accordion controls to the left side affects usability.
  
### Outcome

Findings and recommendations from this research will **inform design guidance and documentation  for the "save in progress" feature** (i.e., a documented pattern in the VA Design System) for authenticated users filling out forms on VA.gov. 

### Research questions

#### Research goal 1: See if Veterans understand that their form data is being saved as they're filling out a form but haven't submitted it yet.
1. What reactions/feedback do Veterans have upon encountering the interstitial page after clicking "Continue"?
1. Do Veterans think that their form data is being saved? If so, how confident are they?
1. Do Veterans remember later what the interstitial page said?

#### Research goal 2: See if Veterans can stop filling out a form, get signed out, and then resume filling out a form.  
1. Do Veterans use the "Finish later" button to stop filling out a form?
1. What feedback do Veterans have on the revised "Finish later" page? 
1. Are Veterans able to resume filling out a form that they previously started? If so, how?
1. Do users realize that they have to sign in before resuming the form?

#### Research goal 3: See if moving the accordion controls to the left side affects usability.
1. Are Veterans able to open and close accordions with controls on the left side? (especially people using a screen magnifier)

### Hypotheses

1. With the new design, Veterans are confident that their form data will be saved.
1. Telling Veterans about auto saving after the first form page is a time when they are receptive and likely to remember.
1. With the new design, Veterans will be able to stop filling out a form, get signed out, and then resume filling out a form.
1. All Veterans (including screen magnifier and screen reader users) will find the accordion controls on the left side easy to use.


## Methodology  üõ†Ô∏è
We will conduct **remote moderated usability testing** to observe research participants filling out an online form. The participants will be logged in so that the information they enter will be automatically saved before the form is submitted. We will be using a **GitHub Codespace** that is accessible to screen readers and screen magnifiers. 

Sessions will be conducted over Zoom with transcripts. 

### Location
This is remote research over Zoom. 
- [X] **Remote**
- [ ] **In-person**
