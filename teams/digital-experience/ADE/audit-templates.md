# Templates for Accessibility Audits
The following accessibility audit documentation has been created via Google Docs, in order to create the most accessible version of each document for our team. Rather than duplicate this content, we are linking to the shared Google files,below.

ADE support offerings are detailed in the [ADE Menu of Services](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/digital-experience/ADE#services-we-offer).

> [!TIP]
> - Each Google Document will have a last updated date in the first-page header. If you make any updates to a template, please adjust the date accordingly.

## Review Wireframes and Figma Prototypes

- We can review your static wireframes or interactive prototypes looking for potential accessibility issues.
- We can also work with you and advise on how to annotate designs to ensure that they are easy to implement in an accessible way.

### Templates
- [Design Review: Google Doc template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oIMVsxYitmY-dyWu9zpek-MUnbY42PszkupNvgda1wI/edit?usp=drive_link) (permissions needed)
- [Design Review: Markdown template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/digital-experience/ADE/templates/design-review-template.md)

## Staging / CodePen / Production Audit

- We can review coded products, either on staging or CodePen. We test with assistive technology, review for accessibility best practices, and ensure that the product meets OCTO-DE accessibility experience standards.
- We can also help you prepare the [required accessibility testing artifact](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/prepare-for-an-accessibility-staging-review#artifact) for the Collaboration Cycle.
- We can audit products for accessibility issues on desktop and mobile devices (subject to device availability among ADE specialists).

<!-- ## Health Check Audit

This is very much like a staging review but done in production! This is useful for older products that were implemented and released before certain standards were put into place.
