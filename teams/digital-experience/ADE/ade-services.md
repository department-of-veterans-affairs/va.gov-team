  * Depends on the size and number of user flows, but generally 1-2 days.  
* **Who does what:**  
  * **Requesting team:** Submit an intake ticket. Provide context for the tester, the link to start from, and very specific instructions about the user flows to test. Option for team members to observe.  
  * **ADE:** Review the user flows using AT.  
* **Results:**   
  * ADE assesses whether the flows are currently usable by AT, reports AT issues encountered during flow testing, and recommends fixes or improvements.  
* **Benefits:**   
  * ADE quickly finds issues and provides recommendations.  
* **Considerations:**   
  * ADE doesn’t audit every page and interaction and so may miss something.   
  * No feedback from actual Veterans.</details>


<details>
<summary>Accessibility testing artifact for the Collaboration Cycle</summary>

ADE can help your team prepare for an upcoming Staging Review by doing an accessibility testing artifact on your behalf.

* **When to use this service:**  
  * Your product is going through the Collaboration Cycle. You've requested a Staging Review and development is paused. You don't have time or staffing to complete the required [Accessibility Testing Artifact](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?template=a11y-testing-md.md).   
* **Time needed:**   
  * 1-2 days  
* **Who does what:**  
  * **Requesting team:** Submit an intake ticket. Provide a link to the product, login information (if applicable), and the user flow (so ADE knows which screens to test). Pause development during the testing.   
  * **ADE:** Perform accessibility testing and fill out the accessibility testing artifact.   
* **Results:**   
  * ADE provides the artifact as a comment in the intake ticket, so you can create your own ticket, paste it in, and send it to the Governance team.  
* **Benefits:**  
  * You get your accessibility testing artifact to the Governance team on schedule.  
* **Considerations:**   
  * You don’t test the product yourself so you’ll miss out on better understanding accessibility and the issues your product may have.</details>
