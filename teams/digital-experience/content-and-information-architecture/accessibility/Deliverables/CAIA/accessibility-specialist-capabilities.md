# Accessibility Capabilities

This document aims to describe a number of capabilities that accessibility specialists working within OCTO could bring to the space. 

This document doesn't mean to suggest that every accessibility specialist needs to have *all* of these capabilities, rather, this document aims to **suggest** some potential sorts of accessibility specialists, with the goal of further refining what we mean and what is expected when we say "accessibility specialist."

## Suggested Roles

Each role maps to a need or gap currently existing within OCTO. These titles are suggested to make sense given the current context of OCTO and CAIA -- the industry, though, may use slightly different terms, e.g. what we think of as an "accessibility strategist" would likely be an "accessibility program manager" or an "accessibility product manager."

These roles could work in either a centralized (CAIA) context or embedded in delivery teams. Each role, though, includes a note suggesting the "reach" that the role should have to be optimally effective.

There are many situations where a specialist may fit into more than one category -- this is expected, but probably shouldn't be optimized for, e.g. we shouldn't assume a unicorn who can fill 3 roles at once is better than having 2 experts who can share those 3 roles.

All of this work is [informed by WCAG's suggestions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/arrm/roles/).
