# Accessibility Tools Utilized
`iOS-VO`, `MacOS-VO`, `iOS voice to text`

## Coverage
CAIA A11Ys, covered 67% (4/6) of this study's entire assistive technology research sessions.

> 6 AT users, with 4 SR sessions to be supported by CAIA

Our observations were limited to users of Apple assistive technology (AT). (One user participated with an Android phone, but didn't use AT.) We would like to note that there is a large segment of AT users that we did not observe, such as Windows users (JAWS, NVDA, etc.) and Android device users, that may have revealed additional accessibility issues.

However, we feel it is correct to assume that, if an accessibility issue is encountered during testing, it is worth fixing, and the probability of someone else experiencing that same accessibility issue exists. These findings comprise a list of issues that will need to be prioritized by the researcher, among the non-AT issues, identified in the study.

We hope this information can be of use to your team, in your fuller report.

**Participants who successfully completed sessions: 4**

## Key Findings
Add screenshots, images and videos here.

### Finding 1: Prototype B's non-collapsed menu options were easier to navigate for AT users
- Mobile user felt that having the menu options open by default (Prototype B), rather than behind a dropdown/hidden menu (Prototype A), was easier for him to use.

> “You have to click it to find out what’s in the menu. With icons, you don’t have to click, you can just go to the icon if you know where the icon is.” - P10

- **Note:** The non-AT user in the study felt that Prototype A was more intuitive, due to the "MyHealtheVet" label on the menu.

> "I feel like this one is more intuitive with the ‘MyHealtheVet’ [text]." - P9

### Finding 2: Prototype B's lack of a "Home" option was confusing
- Desktop user was able to figure out that "MyHealtheVet" would take them to the home page, but only because a) of its location and b) her familiarity with the app.
- She was able to navigate to Prototype A's "Home" much more quickly.

> "When I landed on the title as MyHealtheVet, I wondered if it was the same as Home. I assumed it was because it’s in the same spot...I’m in MyHealtheVet so why would I click on MyHealtheVet? Did I leave [the app]?" - P11

> "The first one said ‘Home,’ that was more comfortable for me. I don’t know if I would’ve clicked on ‘MyHealtheVet’ at all." - P11

### Finding 3: Locating medical supplies order form - and any items that aren't in the top nav - was confusing
- Users didn't know what options were available to them if they weren't listed in the top navigation. P11 assumed that there would be more on the Home page, but only because of her familiarity with the app.

> "Was frustrating that Payments wasn’t one of those [navigation] choices. I’d expect it up here, or to be grouped into a dropdown menu if possible. Because the [four nav items] seemed like my only choices. There’s no place for “Other” up there." - P11

- P10 expected this to be available to him in the top navigation. He went through the navigation items and couldn't find it there; he wasn't able to find it until the facilitator directed him to the Home page.

> "I didn’t know there was a section for medical supplies." - P10

- P11 assumed it would be under "Meds," and wasn't sure where to find it otherwise:

> "I’m hoping and praying it would be under ‘Meds’! Because I think that would make sense, even though it’s not a medication, it’s a medical supply." _Where else would you look for it?_ "That's a good question...if I didn’t know and it was afterhours, when I couldn’t call VA to ask, I would probably send a secure message to my primary care doctor." - P11

- P9 thought that if a prescription for CPAP equipment was already in the system, it'd be listed under "Meds," and didn't know where to look for travel pay:

> "It depends…if I have something in the system that has them. If I don’t, I might have to go to messages. If I do, maybe I go to Meds? I’m thinking my doctors made an order for me and that would be in there, I assume." _Where would you go to get reimbursed for travel pay?_ "I don’t see that option on this [MHV] page. Maybe it’s under appointments?...Maybe there'd be a 'travel voucher' option, in a perfect world?"

 
### Finding 4: Entering MyHealtheVet directly into the "X-ray results" secure message was disorienting, but welcome
- P10 assumed that "X-ray results" was the home page, and didn't realize that it wasn't for a bit.

> "A lot of times, when you sign in to something, even VA.gov, it takes you to [the] actual home page. That’s why I said home page, even though this prototype, now that you mention it, might not be the home page." - P10

- Users liked this! They thought it was a welcome change that would save them steps.
> "So where it takes you to after sign in isn’t the home page? And ‘home - dashboard’ is the official ‘home page’? I like it!" - P10
> "If [medical records] really comes up this way, this would be amazing!" - P11

### Finding 5: Screen reader pronounciations lead to hesitation
- In Prototype B, P10's screen reader pronounced "Appts" as "apps," which he needed us to clarify.

> "I take it that’s short for appointments? It sounded like the screen reader was saying ‘apps’."

- In both prototypes, P11's screen reader didn't pronounce "MyHealtheVet" correctly. P11 noted this and wondered if it could be corrected.

### Finding 6: Users expected to access their medical records from the message itself
- The secure message mentioned medical records, and users wanted to access those records from the message.
- All users eventually found the Medical Records page, but after prompting from the facilitator.

> "In the body of the email. Or maybe as an attachment here. Particularly in the options on the top - ‘see results,’ maybe." - P9

> "Those 4 tabs underneath didn’t exactly give me the info I needed. Unless it’s under the “print” option and you can look at it before you print it. I don’t see a dedicated button. On the other website, it gives you a ‘view’ option." - P10

> "(On the current website) I would go to blue button Message, and then I’d look through my results. I’d probably customize my date range [to find it]. And then I’d click on ‘lab results." = P11

### Finding 7: Some users misunderstood the secure messaging 'email' buttons
- Reply, trash, and move: some users didn't understand what those buttons would do.

> “Have no idea what that means.” - P10, on "reply"
> "Maybe if I’m on my computer, I’m moving it to my desktop? I’m not sure. I didn’t know we could do files in this system." - P9, on trying to define the "move" button

## a11y Recommendations

### Use an expanded menu on mobile - with "Home" and additional options
- Whether you're using icons or not, AT users had an easier time accessing the MHV nav bar when the links were expanded (as in Prototype B) rather than hidden by default (as in Prototype A).
- Consider adding other options, like applying for medical supplies, to the nav bar. Since there are design constraints, perhaps these could go under a "More" or "Other" menu. Yes, they'd need to be hidden by default, but at least they'd be accessible without having to go to the home page.
- You should also add a "Home" option. Users didn't think that clicking on "MyHealtheVet" would take them to the MHV home page - the word "Home" was much clearer.
- Hypothesis: This will make it easier for AT users to use MHVs navigation and find what they need, without needing to go to the home page (or _know_ that they need to go to the home page) to access more options.
- **Note:** The non-AT user we observed had an easier time with the closed menu (Prototype A). We weren't in other non-AT user sessions, so this might not track as a general trend. And the user, while preferring Prototype A, felt that Prototype B was easy to use.

### Prototype B - Replace the accessible name of "Apps" with "Appointments"
- You can do this in one of two ways:
   1. Change the visible text label from "Appts" to "Appointments"
   2. Add `aria-label="Appointments"` to that navigation link. The `aria-label` will become the accessible name of the link, and assitive tech users will hear "Appointments" read aloud. (_Note:_ if this page is ever translated, you'll need to manually change the aria-label as well.)
- Hypothesis: This will clear up confusion around what "appts" means, since AT users will hear the full word "Appointments."

### "X-ray results" / Individual message - change the heading structure
- Currently, the X-ray results individual message has "X-ray results" as the H1.
- Instead, you can structure the page as follows:
```
<h1>Message</h1>
<h2>X-Ray Results</h2>
```
- Hypothesis: this will clarify that the user is on an individual message with a title of "X-ray results."
- Hypothesis: this may also clarify that the user is **not** on the MHV home page, which will better orient them as they enter the site.

## Other considerations and findings 

- Finding results from the Medical Records page, and figuring out where to make an appointment on the Appointments page, went very well!
- Users loved getting to the page they needed right away, without having to navigate through the website. They also loved that their latest medical tests showed up on top of the list.
- Overall, users found it more accessible than what they were used to, and easy to use. :)
- It's generally not recommended to "hack" a screen reader's pronunciation of a word (like "MyHealtheVet"). Users ususally get used to the 'fun' way that brand names are mispronounced, and changing it could be confusing.
