 > [!TIP]
> - Here are the [tools CAIA uses](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/2e5a0a08bd51ae3258de4c9f37754f907e938586/teams/CAIA/accessibility/tools-we-use.md#tools-we-use) during our reviews.
> - We also review designs to make sure they are following the [Design System's guidance with respect to components and patterns.](https://design.va.gov)
> - We recommend teams use the [VA Experience Standards](https://design.va.gov/about/experience-standards/) as a framework, when building products. 
 

## Mobile Prototype
 
- [ ] Run axe checks on every page or unique state (required)
- [ ] Color contrast checks
- [ ] Color blindness checks
- [ ] Tab order
- [ ] Zoom layouts to 400% and inspect them for readability. If layouts break at 400%, I will start reducing them until they become stable, and log the zoom ratio when things started breaking.
- [ ] Keyboard navigation
- [ ] Windows, Chrome, JAWS
- [ ] MacOS, Safari, VoiceOver
