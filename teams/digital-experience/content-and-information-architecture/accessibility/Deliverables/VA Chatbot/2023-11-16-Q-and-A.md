   - **Moving Focus**
        - In most browsers, people can move focus by pressing the `Tab` key and the `Shift` + `Tab` keys.
            - This is the **expected paradigm for how to shift focus to different elements** of a page from the keyboard across VA.gov, as well as the web at large.
                - It is an *assumed* norm, though.
            - If there is a deviation from this _assumed norm_, there will need to be justification for why something else is necessary/better and a path to onboard folks using the tool that explains the difference.
