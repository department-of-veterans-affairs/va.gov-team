## Auditor(s): (Your name)

## Testing Coverage:
#### User profile used: (add staging email used)

### Automated
 * [ ] Run axe checks on every page or unique state (required)
 * [ ] Run WAVE on every page if time allows. WAVE is more visual than axe or axe-coconut, but offers some excellent ways to identify nested headings and HTML5 landmark tags.

### Manual
 * [ ] Color contrast checks (recommend using whocanuse.com for beyond compliance reports)
 * [ ] Color blindness checks
 * [ ] Zoom layouts to 400% and inspect them for readability. If layouts break at 400%, I will start reducing them until they become stable, and log the zoom ratio when things started breaking.
 * [ ] Keyboard navigation
 
### Screen Reader
 * [ ] Windows, JAWS
      * [ ] Chrome
      * [ ] Firefox
      * [ ] Microsoft Edge
 * [ ] Mac, VoiceOver
     * [ ] Chrome
     * [ ] Safari
