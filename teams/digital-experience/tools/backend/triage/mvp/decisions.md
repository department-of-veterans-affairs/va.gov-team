## MVP
- Continuation of status quo process - actually triaging incoming issues
- Documentation of that process and Triage team responsibilities
- A few adjustments to "satus quo" by June 12:
  - Include current on-call approach in Triage documentation
  - Include that Triage team is responsible for iterating on their process and tooling to make Triage more effecrive
  - Include that Triage is owner of monitoring, prioritizing, shepherding all things Sentry
  - Include initial draft definitions of Tiers 1, 2, and 3 and what constitutes a handoff from one to the next?
  - Include initial approach to sharing expected impact and resolution w/wide audience of stakeholders?
  
The Triage MVP will "kick off" (in quotes bc it's a continuation of the existing process) on June 12, 2019, and will start iteration activities on the most critical gaps/problems around the end of June, 2019.
