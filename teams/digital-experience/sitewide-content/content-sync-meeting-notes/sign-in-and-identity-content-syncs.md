Attendees: Aliyah, Lauren, Clayton, Carl, Phil, Camille, Megan D., Rachel, and Jeana

**FAQ coordination/CLP:**
- Update for awareness -secure sign in team coordinating coordinating with Danielle about updates to FAQ pages to include information about known issues. They've also been keeping an eye on blog posts and social media comments for information that points to any known issues.
- Carl submitted information for a new CLP.

**Estimated timing:**
- Login.gov - no specific data from Login.gov on online and in-person proofing. Login.gov feels that the average timing is about 10 minutes (online only).
- ID.me - data shows average timing (if someone does this alone) is about 4 minutes and 28 minutes if someone has to call a "trusted referee" during the process.
- Login.gov just completed a study about in-person proofing. No results posted yet, but we can keep an eye on this.
- Clayton suspects that we currently use 5 to 10 minutes based on the info sign in partners. We can continue conversation about how to adjust/address this.

**Verify language on VA.gov forms:**
- Aliyah updated that there is language about verifying identity across forms on VA.gov. There will be a larger effort to address this so that's it's closely tied to sign in and identity updates. No final decision about content for all forms during our call.
- For awareness, we took a look at the content Megan Z. (CAIA team) worked on with Rachel and Jeana for Veterans facing forms.
- Clayton and Megan D. expressed concerns about there being no link or information about what the term "verifying" means and flagged some potential updates to the Verifying your identity page to include a sentence about why we require this.

Aliyah shared the link from Danielle about the updates to the Get a Premium MHV page. That pages is currently being reviewed.

We let the team know that there's a plan to redirect this page to this privacy policy page - https://www.va.gov/privacy-policy/. Terms of use will cover many of the security items listed on the privacy and security page.
- Timing to complete identity verification with Login.gov or ID.me - Sophia/Clayton were chatting about this earlier in the week. Clayton has an action item to research this with CSPs.

Attendees: Aliyah, Lauren, Laura, Clayton, Carl, Sophia, Joe, Nathalie, Josh (researcher on identity MFA team), and Matt (designer on chatbot team)
- **Audit updates:** Danielle working with Tom and Lauren A. on this. We'll need to wait until their plan is fianlized before we (Laura and Aliyah) begin any audit work.
- **Content in authenticated experience about verifying identity:** Aliyah circled back to a question re: the types of content a user may see if they'll need to verify their identity, depending on the sign in partner they've used. After our meeting, Joe shared a screen capture of a screen that says what they can do if they have a verified Login.gov or ID.me account (sign out and sign back in with one of these accounts) **or** if they don't have either of those account types (created an account with Login.gov or ID.me and then verify identity).
- **Veteran support team:** Camille joined the call and chatted a bit more about the research that her team is doing on the feedback surveys on R&S pages.
- We clarified on the call that some of the research findings may be about the "Signing in to VA.gov" page because folks will enter the study from the specific page.
- Clayton/CORE identity team would be happy to hear if there's any feedback on the Signing in to VA.gov page that comes up in research. The CORE identity team/LGA teams are coordinating with Camille on how they'll share that research.
  

**October 12, 2023**
-
Attendees: Aliyah, Lauren, Laura, Clayton, Carl, Sophia, Nathalie, Ngozi
- Camille (Veteran Support team) is planing research on the **Signing in to VA.gov page.** She'll join the next meeting to chat more about her research plans and we can discuss how this may overlap with research done by the CORE identity team (Clayton).
- **Audit:** We discussed that we'll need to do a comprehensive audit (unauthenticated and authenticated experiences) for mentions of sign in options. 
  - Audit of authenticated experience would involve public websites
  - This audit may need to happen in several phases
  - Any changes to widgets on forms/applications/tools would need a lot of lead time to begin updating. Aliyah and Laura can change widget content on static pages, but we'll need to coordinate with product teams for widgets that may appear inside forms/applications/tools.
  - Nathalie (chatbot team) mentioned that they'll need to do an audit and make manual updates. She'll chat more with her designers and developers. If their team has content from us, it may not be a huge lift on their part.
  - Sophia suggested looping in PMs on this call. Laura and Aliyah to chat more with Danielle about this audit and timing.
  - **We'll continue the discussion in our next meeting**

     - Purpose of meeting is to review and discuss any content (on static pages, sign in modals, or alerts on VA.gov) that relates to the upcoming sign in changes on VA.gov. We also use the time to discuss or consider how other initiatives overlap with this work.
     - Sophia shared a visual (for internal use) of the review proccess flow, given the new MHV-VA.gov-Identity Communications Group review process.
     - We clarified that if there are changes that the LGA team is making to the sign in modal or content for an interstitial page, Laura and Aliyah will review that work with you them and the LGA team will be responsible for putting those items through the new review process.
- Nathalie joined and Aliyah summarized some past work with the chatbot team related to sign in and identity. [This is a ticket with that past work](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/49815). Laura asked if updates to the chatbot are manual or dynamic - Nathalie said that it's both. Nathalie will join future meetings and provide more clarity on how this group/sitewide content will need to be involved in chatbot content that aligns with how we're currently discussing signing in to VA.gov.
- Meetings will now be bi-weekly, for 1 hour. We'll have this meeting on the weeks that we don't have the MHV-VA.gov Identity Communications Group meeting.

- **Creating an account on VA.gov page**
     - We'll need to think through content to address Veterans who can't or don't qualify to create a Login.gov account.  Two sets of information would likely need to exist - **1.** What do I do if I've failed the online proofing **2.** I can't create a Login.gov account and won't ever be able to create a Login.gov account (for example, due to living outside of the U.S.)
     - Dawn sent a question to Login.gov partners to find out if there's a list of all of the scenarios when someone wouldn't qualify to create a Login.gov account.

     - We're shifiting plan and will actually move forward with integrating feedback from the identity teams and publish those changes first. Then we'll continue to review additional questions to consider adding to the page with Joe and CORE identity team.
 - **Comms plan from LGA team:** Carl updated that they're working on an internal document that compiles all things sign in /identity in - in one deck. He flagged that their deck will also include imagery guidelines and email template guidance. Sitewide CAIA (content) noted that if they're pulling any content from the content brief or style guide, we recommend that they include a link out to the content brief or style guide, so that we aren't duplicating any of that information and have clarity/one source of truth for the content brief and style guide items. **Action item:** Carl to update us on name of this comms document/plan, as we don't want this to be called a style guide.
 - **Email templates:** Followed up with Carl on question via Slack about the constraints in the Test A email template and if those constraints will be the same for the Test B email. Dawn flagged that the Test A email is a VEO template and they'll continue to use this until they have an OCTO account. **Action item for Aliyah/Laura:** Pass feedback to Dawn about things that we’d suggest changing in the template – pass in a word document. **Action item for Dawn** She'll get answers about whether those are things that we can change.
 - **Privacy and security at VA page:** Laura asked for groups thoughts on how to make updates to this page, as some information is outdated and it only discusses ID.me and not Login.gov. Joe mentioned that the CORE team wrote part of this content in the past.

LGA team will provide notes on content updates and sitewide CAIA (content) will implement. **Action item**: Sitewide CAIA (content) to do a review first and see where we can pull in existin content.

**Notes**
- Dawn (product and delivery manager for Login.gov Adoption team) joined meeting. Aliyah added Dawn to our channel and to future meeting invites.
- We provided updates on DS Logon FAQs and related pages:
    - Style change: John confirmed we should say Login.gov and ID.me meet "modern security standards" rather than "the latest federal security standards." We’ve adjusted this on the Creating an account on VA.gov page.
     - Confirmed with Joe that the verification step doesn't always happen at first sign in with Login.gov or ID.me. It happens the first time you access a page with PII/PHI. So we're adjusting to say "The first time you use your account to manage your VA benefits or information, you'll need to verify your identity"
     - **Continued action:** Aliyah gathering screen captures of all changes (post feedback) and sending another email to John and Tom by EOD Friday 6/23.

   - Joe previously confirmed that the Experian pin info is no longer accurate. We adjusted question answer to reflect that users would need to unfreeze their credit to use this form of verification. We'll also add a sentence about how to unfreeze credit.
 

**June 8, 2023**
-
Attendees: Aliyah, Laura, Sofia, Joe, Carl, and Amber

**Notes**
- We started to review the "Verifying your identity on VA.gov" page. We'll update the page with these changes after we publish the Phase 1 changes (DS Logon related updates). We'll continue reviewing this page next week.

  - We'll plan to remove "without a Premium account" from the question "How do I verify my identity online?"

  - Joe confirmed info for ID.me online identity verification - if a user can't upload their driver's license or passport, they can answer questions based on private and public data (like a credit report). We added this info as a "Note" at the end of the bulleted list.
  - We discussed adjusting the "Can I verify my identity in person at a VA facility?" to remove "at a VA facility" and change the focus from MHV in person process to Login.gov in person process at USPS. We'll pause on doing this until we get more information about VA requirements around in person verification.
  - **Action item:** Joe will confirm if Experian still offers a PIN if credit is frozen.

**June 2, 2023**
-
Ad hoc sync with Laura, Aliyah, Joe

**Notes**
- Laura and Aliyah walked through first round of DS Logon-related page updates with Joe for accuracy review.
- Joe confirmed that for both Login.gov and ID.me, VA prompts you to verify the first time you try to access or manage your VA benefits or information, not necessarily the first time you sign in. For some people, it's the first sign-in but not always.
- Joe confirmed that "phone number on a phone plan in your name" is required and this is a key piece of information to keep in our pages.
- Joe confirmed that at this time, changing direct deposit is the only action that requires Login.gov or ID.me accounts, but this may expand in future so we can keep wording as "certain tasks and information."
- Joe flagged that we may need content to address certain groups that can't create Login.gov accounts, including those without state ID and those with non-US addresses. We'll follow up on this in next sync.
- Joe shared that at this time, we can't get direct links to the "create" screens in Login.gov or ID.me flows.
  -  Next step: Joe will add technical documentation for this blocker
  -  Next step: Laura/Aliyah will check back in in 90 days to see if there's movement on this issue

**June 1, 2023**
-
Attendees: Aliyah, Laura, Sofia, Carl, Amber

**Notes**
- Reviewed the Signing in to VA.gov page to make sure it's current. 
- Next step: Adjust "Go to" vs "Visit" link text in last Q&A to be consistent.
- Question: On Creating an account page, different wording in Login and ID sections makes it sound like we prompt to verify at different points in the account creation process — is this accurate? 
  - (Note: We followed up on this in ad hoc with Joe on June 2.)
- Question: On Signing in page, we discuss "confirmation emails" — are these referring to the step in the process where you confirm your email address, or the email we send at the end of the process to confirm that you successfully created an account?
  - Next step: Follow up on this in next sync.

**May 11, 2023**

Attendees: Laura and Sofia

**Notes**
- Sofia shared PDF showing Login.gov account creation process that Login.gov adoption team created for planned campaign landing page. This resource was requested by MHV team.

- Action step: Revisit PDF resource and align on content for planned campaign landing page
