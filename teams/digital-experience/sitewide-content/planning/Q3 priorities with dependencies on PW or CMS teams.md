# Operations

- **SWC priority:** Create a broad content intake request form that helps to guide our VA partners through the process of determining if they need a CLP, benefit hub content (new/updated), resources and support content (new/updated), or something else.
  - **Key collaboration needs:**
    - Collaboration on form
    
# Resources and support

- **SWC priority:** Continue to migrate more legacy content into Resources and Support, while bringing more non-OCTO content authors into Drupal.
  - **Key collaboration needs:** 
    - Expand reusability of Q&As to the R&S detail template (and beyond if possible) _(#1 priority)_
    - Refine resources and support analytics dashboard (collaboration with analytics team as well)
    - Continue exploration, testing, and monitoring of tag UI as we add more content and topic tags
    - Continued non-OCTO author training and Drupal support
    - Make it possible for authors to choose both "Veterans" and "Family members" as audience type, with governance added in as to when to choose both (limited cases of content that will cross both audiences)
  - **Additional collaboration needs:**
    - Implement deeper feedback choices for R&S articles (in progress)
    - Document criteria and process for resources and support redirects
    - Add content governance/standards guidance into the authoring experience
    - Continue exploration of taxonomy iteration (no significant action for teams in Q3, but noting for awareness)

# Benefit hubs

- **SWC priority:** Ongoing iterations of tool landing pages (which have dynamic content due to Cerner) - carried over from Q2.
  - **Key collaboration needs:**
    - Engineering work to transfer content updates into react files  

- **SWC priority:** Create structured content model for benefit high-level description, eligibility, and how to apply content. Rework these pages in at least health care and disability in Q3.
  - **Key collaboration needs:**
    - Refine benefit hub analytics dashboard (collaboration with analytics team as well)
    - Create structured content model for information and harden templates for eligibility and how to apply pages _(could carry over into Q4)_
  - **Additional collaboration needs:**
    - Make related link descriptions automatically generated 

# Multilingual content

- **SWC priority:** Translate more vital benefit content and maintain existing translated content. Potentially add language assistance and resources pages in more languages (depending on "fact sheet" solution).
  - **Key collaboration needs:**
    - Engineering work to add language toggles and ensure accessibility for each added page (limited work to support each release)
    - Add ability to import/export XLIFF, HTML, or XML versions of Drupal pages (need to discuss continued blockers, but adding for Q3 because this is a priority need for translation management)
