# How to choose related links for an R&S article
Every resources and support article must contain at least one related link. These links should make sense for the topic of the page and should really relate to the subject of the article. You want to make sure the benefit detail page or R&S article you're choosing can provide the user with more relevant information that's connected to the article they're reading.  

For example, on the [In-state tuition rates under the Veterans Choice Act](https://www.va.gov/resources/in-state-tuition-rates-under-the-veterans-choice-act/) article, the related links point to pages about programs that users need to be enrolled in to be able to participate in the Veterans Choice Act. The article also links to pages that answer broader questions that someone reading about the Veterans Choice Act may want to know.

If an article links to other pages using the CTA action link at the top of the page or with an embedded text link, don't use these as related links.
