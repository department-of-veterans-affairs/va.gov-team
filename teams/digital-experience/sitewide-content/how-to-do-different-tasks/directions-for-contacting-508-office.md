# Directions for contacting 508 office

## When is a 508 office review needed?

- When adding a new PDF to any page (tier 1 or Resources and Support)
-	When someone from the accessibility team reviews an accessibility ticket and suggests something on the tier 1 page warrants a 508 office review.

## How to contact the 508 office

### For a PDF

1.  Access YourIT! from the VA network (https://yourit.va.gov/va).
2.	In the search box, enter “508 audit request” and click on the top result. The top result should be “508 Accessibility Audit Request.”
3.	You’ll get an input form to enter relevant data.
4.	At the bottom of the form, select “Documents” from the Product Type dropdown.
5.	Upload the document(s) from your computer.

### For a review of a tier 1 page

Email our contact at the VA 508 office (full contact info was sent to each Sitewide Content team member). Ask for a final quick test of the page and provide a link. On the email, CC Trevor Pierce (trevor@adhocteam.us) Noah Gelman (Noah.Gelman@adhocteam.us), and Shira Goodman (shira.goodman@oddbal.io). Reminder that this is done with or after a post-launch accessibility audit.
