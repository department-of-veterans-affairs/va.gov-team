The [Welcome Kit](https://www.va.gov/welcome-kit/) page is a Drupal node containing a collection of PDFs. The VEO team (Veterans Experience Office) manages it and Sitewide Content does the updates and publishing.

## How to make updates to the Welcome Kit page

1. Someone from the VEO office will contact Sitewide Content to update or add a new PDF to the page. 
2. The VEO office will upload the PDF to the assets folder in Drupal. The file name should be all lowercase, have hyphens between words, and no special characters.
3. Sitewide Content will make any text changes to the Drupal node and will add or update the PDF by pulling it from the assets folder.
4. Once updates are made publish changes and let stakeholders know.
