# Which team can help? Public Websites or the CMS team?

Because Sitewide Content and IA doesn't have its own developer on the team, we need to reach out to either Public Websites or the CMS team for assistance. But which team does what?

## Public Websites
Public Websites handles front-end issues on all the static pages on VA.gov (benefit detail pages, resources and support, root-level pages, among others). Here are some reasons you may need their assistance:
- To update a template.
- To update text within a react component. For example, currently there are several health care pages that are mostly in a react component instead of in Drupal. If we need to make edits, Public Websites does these updates.
- To do an audit of something that's found in both authenticated and static pages. Public Websites can do an expansive search and supply a list of instances.
- To create a react widget. Sometimes the product team is responsible for this and other times Public Websites provides these to Sitewide Content and IA to input into Drupal.
- To fix bugs you've discovered on the website (Example: header sizes are showing incorrectly).

If you need help from Public Websites, reach out in their Slack channel #vsa-public-websites. You may need to open an intake request depending on the work needed.

## CMS team
The CMS team manages the Drupal CMS. Here are some reasons you may need their assistance:
- You have trouble getting into Drupal (not getting into Citrix)
- You have a problem finding something or learning how to do something within Drupal
- You've published content and it's not showing up on the live site
- You've noticed something not working or doing something unusual while you're working on a Drupal page

If you need help from the CMS team, open a[ CMS Support Help Request ticket](https://va-gov.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3/group/8/create/26). You can also check the [CMS Knowledge Base](https://prod.cms.va.gov/help) for articles that might help. You must be on the VA network for these links to work.
