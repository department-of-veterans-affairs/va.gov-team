# Tasks for onboarding new Sitewide Content team members

When someone joins the Sitewide Content team there are several onboarding tasks for the product owner, project manager, and new team member to follow for full access to all the tools they'll need. This is separate from the general VA onboarding the contract company and COR will be working on.

We can get the new team member access to GitHub and Slack before they get their VA email. Drupal access requires the VA email.

## Github access
[Read the Platform documentation for getting set up in Github and Zenhub](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/Request-access-to-tools.969605215.html#Requestaccesstotools-GettingaccesstotheVAGitHuborganization![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48728214/166793995-4e3dcba1-f4d9-4a60-916b-2e7c1df45780.png)
)

The product owner or COR needs to submit a ticket to give the new team member access to VA’s Github. [Use this ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/github-user-requests/issues/new?assignees=&labels=add-user-to-org%2Cnew-user%2Cuser-created&template=add-user.yml&title=Add+User+to+Org%3A+%5Busername%5D) <br>

## Platform orientation

[Read about the platform orientation process](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/Platform-Orientation.1877344532.html)

The new team member will need to watch a recording of or attend Platform's general orientation meeting and can watch or attend any other orientations they are interested in.

## Slack access

[Follow these directions to open a ticket to add a team member to the DSVA workspace](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/orientation/slack-requests.md)

**Note:** Note: When the PM opens the ticket, mark the new team member as needing full member access. 

Slack channels to add initially: #sitewide-content-ia, #cms-support

## Drupal access

The PM Slacks the CMS team in the #cms-support channel asking for Drupal credentials for the new team member. They’ll need the new team member's VA email address to set it up. The PM tells the CMS team what Drupal permissions are needed (editing or publishing) and what areas of VA they’ll be working on (benefit pages and resources and support).
