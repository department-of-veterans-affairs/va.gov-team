# Substantive edit checklist
### Purpose
This checklist helps substantive editors complete these activities:
+ Assess content needs for intake requests
+ Check consistency across content components
+ Provide substantive editors to draft content

### Definitions
Copy editors and substantive editors sometimes have overlapping responsibilities.

Generally, **copy editors** focus their content review on these edits:
+ Grammar and sentence structure
+ Plain language and word choice
+ Style guide consistency

Generally, **substantive editors** focus their review on these edits:
+ Content design and strategy
+ Consistency across components
+ Subject matter accuracy

## Assess needs
### When do substantive editors assess content needs?
You should assess content needs when any of these occur:
+ A CAIA or product team member requests an assessment
+ A VA partner requests an assessment
+ An intake ticket indicates that the team doesn't have a dedicated content contributor 

Teams don't always know when they need a content assessment. And they don't always accurately assess their content needs. You may find that an assessment is necessary, even when an intake ticket outlines content work. And you may find that more or less content work is necessary.

When in doubt, ask Beth and Danielle to help scope content work after your assessment.

### How do substantive editors assess content needs?
You should assess content needs by considering these questions:
+ What work is outlined in the intake ticket?
+ What additional work may be needed outside of the intake ticket?
+ What's needed to align the work with consistencies across content components?
+ What is the deadline or timeline for completing the work?
+ Who needs to be involved in completing, reviewing, and publishing the work?
+ What impact will the work have on other forms, pages, or tools? 

### What happens after substantive editors assess content needs?
After you assess content needs, you should complete these next steps:
+ Consult Beth, Danielle, or other content team members to scope the work, as needed
+ Divide the work into tasks with their own deadlines or timelines
+ Ask Lily to create tickets for each task, including assignees, descriptions, and a status
+ Ask Lily to attach each task to the intake ticket
+ Confirm the content tasks with the product team or VA partner before beginning the work

## Check consistencies
These consistencies are recommendations, rather than rules. They outline common approaches and structures to consider while editing.
### Page introductions
+ [ ] Introductions are 5 sentences or shorter
+ [ ] Introductions end with a statement describing the content on the rest of the page
  + Example: "Learn more about your health care benefits."
+ [ ] Introductions are followed by a call to action link
### Featured content
+ [ ] Featured content only include eligibility information
+ [ ] Featured content isn't too long
### Table of contents
+ [ ] Tables include 3 or more H2s
### Links
+ [ ] Link text to external websites include the target (where) and purpose (why)
  + Example: "Request your records using eVetRecs on the national archives website"
