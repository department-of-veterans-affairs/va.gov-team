## Analysis
[Resources and support ratings spreadsheet](https://dvagov-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/randi_hecht_va_gov/Documents/Documents/Analytics/Resources%20and%20support%20ratings%20tracking%20October%202024.xlsx?d=wf6a1b0e59310435982d6f6418a465391&csf=1&web=1&e=7FU3ae)
- This is the second month in a row R&S didn't meet our goal of 75% or higher "good" ratings, with a 64% "good" average rating. This can be attributed to large numbers of "bad" ratings for sign-in related pages. This will most likely continue during the sign-in transition process but we will continue to monitor it.
- Performance isn't as high when broken down to individual pages:
  - 25% of pages are scoring at 90% or higher "good"
  - 51% of pages are meeting our goal of 75% or higher "good," while 58% of pages are scoring 70% or higher
  - 26% of pages are scoring at less than 50% "good," with 6% scoring at less than 10% "good" 
- Sign-in related content continues to have the highest volume of total responses with "bad" ratings. The total number of responses have gone up for these pages since we launched the sign-in transition campaign.
- The PACT Act page continues to be the page with the most responses and has a very high number of "good" responses.
- This was the first month our Disaster help page was in production. It had a high number of responses (634 total) with 95% getting a good rating, putting it at one of our top 5 pages with the highest volume of total responses with >50% "good" rating
- Our Commissary and exchange privileges for Veterans page had one of the lowest experience ratings for the month but also had a high number of "good" responses (96% good out of 285 total responses). We'll review Medallia feedback to try to understand the discrepancy.
