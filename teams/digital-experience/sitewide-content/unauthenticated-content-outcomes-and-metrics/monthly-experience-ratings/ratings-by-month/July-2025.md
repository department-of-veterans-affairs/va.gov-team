- We continue to not meet our goal of a 75% good rating for resources and support pages, with an average rating this month of 70%. 
- Performance isn't as high when broken down to individual pages:
  - 24% of pages are scoring at 90% or higher "good"
  - 47% of pages are meeting our goal of 75% or higher "good," while 54% of pages are scoring 70% or higher
  - 22% of pages are scoring at less than 50% "good," with 4% scoring at less than 10% "good" 
-  Sign-in related pages continue to score poorly. We still believe this is more about the process than the content on the pages, but we'll continue to monitor Medallia feedback to learn if there are any changes we can make to improve these pages.
-  For a second month in a row we had a high number of responses (2,291) for the page "How to renew a VA prescription" and only a 45% good rating. We'll review Medallia feedback to determine if there's a common issue users are mentioning.
-  We moved the VA claim exam to resources and support this month. It was one of pages with the highest volume of responses (728) and a a very high "good" rating (91%).
