- We are close to meeting our goal of a 75% good rating for resources and support pages, with an average rating this month of 74%. 
- Performance isn't as high when broken down to individual pages:
  - 20% of pages are scoring at 90% or higher "good"
  - 57% of pages are meeting our goal of 75% or higher "good," while 62% of pages are scoring 70% or higher
  - 16% of pages are scoring at less than 50% "good," with 1% scoring at less than 10% "good" 
- Sign-in related pages continue to score poorly. We still believe this is more about the process than the content on the pages, but we'll continue to monitor Medallia feedback to learn if there are any changes we can make to improve these pages.
- For a fifth month in a row we had a high number of responses (1,666) for the page "How to renew a VA prescription." 
- For the fourth month since the page has moved to R&S, the VA claim exam page was one of pages with the highest volume of responses (703) and a a very high "good" rating (93%), scoring 4.5% higher than last month
- While the "How to report a complaint or concern about a community provider" is still one of the top volume pages receiving a low "good" rating, it saw a 13% increase in good rating
- The "How to get help with concerns at a VA health facility" page saw a 15% increase in "good" rating
