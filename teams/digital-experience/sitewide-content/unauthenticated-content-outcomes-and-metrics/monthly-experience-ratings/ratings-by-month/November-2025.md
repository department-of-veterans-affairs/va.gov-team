## Analysis
[Resources and support ratings spreadsheet]
- For the first time since the sign-in transition work, we are meeting our goal of a 75% good rating for resources and support pages, with an average rating this month of 75%. 
- Performance isn't as high when broken down to individual pages:
  - 24% of pages are scoring at 90% or higher "good"
  - 52% of pages are meeting our goal of 75% or higher "good," while 56% of pages are scoring 70% or higher
  - 21% of pages are scoring at less than 50% "good," with 8% scoring at less than 10% "good" 
- Sign-in related pages continue to score poorly. We still believe this is more about the process than the content on the pages, but we'll continue to monitor Medallia feedback to learn if there are any changes we can make to improve these pages.
- For a sixth month in a row we had a high number of responses (1,411) for the page "How to renew a VA prescription." 
- For the fifth month since the page has moved to R&S, the VA claim exam page was one of pages with the highest volume of responses (676) and a a very high "good" rating (93%)
