- We continue to not meet our goal of a 75% good rating for resources and support pages, with an average rating this month of 70%. 
- Performance isn't as high when broken down to individual pages:
  - 39% of pages are scoring at 90% or higher "good"
  - 47% of pages are meeting our goal of 75% or higher "good," while 56% of pages are scoring 70% or higher
  - 23% of pages are scoring at less than 50% "good," with 15% scoring at less than 10% "good" 
- Sign-in related pages continue to score poorly. We still believe this is more about the process than the content on the pages, but we'll continue to monitor Medallia feedback to learn if there are any changes we can make to improve these pages.
- For a fourth month in a row we had a high number of responses (2,176) for the page "How to renew a VA prescription." This month was had a slight increase, with a 58% good rating. 
- For the third month since the page has moved to R&S, the VA claim exam page was one of pages with the highest volume of responses (755) and a a very high "good" rating (89%).
- The helpful VA phone number page saw a 12% decrease in overall satisfaction rating, scoring 40% "good"
