# Monthly experience ratings monitoring

## Goal

Regularly monitor the health of our unauthenticated Veteran and beneficiary content to make continuous improvements.

## Process

1. Record the previous month's results for pages with the top 5 highest and lowest experience ratings (available on the All VA.gov Domo dashboard).
2. Record the previous month's results for top 5 resources and support pages with the highest and lowest good/bad ratings (available in Danielle's shared Google Analytics reports).
3. Compile combined list and request Medallia data for listed pages.
4. Analyze Medallia data and further analytics to determine lowest-performing page to add for consider for quarterly comprehension/content testing.
5. Each quarter, test top 3 lowest-performing pages that we identify as having the most opportunity for content-specific improvement. (**Note:** The goal is to move to monthly testing, but we'll start with quarterly for now).
