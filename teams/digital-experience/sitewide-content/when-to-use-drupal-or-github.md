# When to use Drupal vs. Github for content

The Sitewide Content team uses Drupal for almost all content work being done on the site, including the following: 

- Benefit detail pages
- Resources and support
- Campaign Landing pages
- Root-level pages
- Left-nav and mega menu 

**All pages in Drupal can eventually be published on the live site if they're done on prod (not staging).** If the content is for internal purposes only, use Github.

**If a page is only ever going to be on staging and not be pushed to the live site, work in Github.**

The Sitewide Content team uses Github for the following:

- COVID-19 chatbot
- Product support for other teams. All authenticated content is in Github, so updates are made there.
