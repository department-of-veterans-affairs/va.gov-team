# Assessment criteria for requests to update existing VA.gov webpages

These are the types of requests we get:
-	Add content to an existing page.
-	Remove content from an existing page.
-	Update (edit) content on an existing page.
-	Link to an external webpage or PDF.
-	Archive a webpage that’s entirely outdated.

## How we assess incoming requests

**The first question to ask:** Does the addition or edit retain the Veteran-facing focus of the page? 

**Exception:** For a small percentage of our pages, the audience is family members or caregivers, so we'd want to retain that focus. 

What we want to avoid is mixing in information for accredited representatives, school officials, or other people who support Veterans. The information for those audiences doesn't belong in our benefit hubs. It may be appropriate to talk to the stakeholder about placing the information in an existing or new resources and support article. 

**Follow-up questions:**
-	What’s the overall value to Veterans of this content change? 
-	Does this update help Veterans understand their benefits better, find and apply for benefits and services available to them, or generally have a positive experience on VA.gov? 
-	Are we providing Veterans with new or updated information, or is the information already captured on one of our VA.gov pages? We don’t want to present information on our page, then link to an asset that simply repeats most of the same information in a new format. (If there’s some new information in a guide or fact sheet that would be helpful to a Veteran, rather than linking to the guide, consider adding that new information to the VA.gov page.)
-	What's the reason for adding it? Does it solve an identified problem? For instance, Veterans are confused about something / there are changes to a program or act that affect Veteran benefits. (Example: The Blue Water Navy Act changed the rules for VA-backed home loans in that a certain category of Veteran would no longer have home loan limits.)

## Why we might decline a request

-	It’s not Veteran-facing.
-	It’s an addition that simply repackages (in the form of an administration webpage or PDF) info that we already have on our site.
-	It’s promotional content that’s associated with a campaign.

## How to move forward with a request

If you determine that sitewide content should fulfill this request, you’ll need to determine the best way to go about it and document it in the ticket. Put this information in the ticket:

### Placement 
1. Is the webpage where the SME requested the change or addition the best place for this change or addition? If not, where should this update happen—on a different webpage or perhaps on a new webpage? 
2. Once you decide which webpage the change should be made on, the next decision is where on the page (worked into existing running text vs within a new Q&A vs in an info alert vs in a “Note,” etc.)

### Messaging and plain language 

Edit or rewrite the provided text to align with the VA.gov style guide’s voice and plain language standards while retaining the messaging.

### Questions for the SME who made the request 

You may need to clarify some details in order to fulfill the request. Add any questions to the ticket that you have. 

### An explanation for the SME who made the request

Much of the time, you’ll find that the best solution for Veterans differs from the original request. You’ll need to write up an explanation for the SME of what you did and why the approach is best for Veterans. You may want to point to the style guide, or you may want to say that you’ve edited the text so that “it aligns with the VA.gov voice, style, and plain language standards.” It may be relevant to talk about the importance of consistency across our site. Add your explanation to the ticket.
