## Our UX research/design process

### High-level feature migration process

Generally, the Facilites team follow these steps for research and design. Additional steps (such as a second round of usability testing, or production review) may be added as needed.
  
1. Analyze existing feature
2. Conduct discovery research on existing feature (see [Resources and support](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/research/discovery-sprints/taxonomy/VBA-services-discovery.md) discovery example)
3. Synthesize analysis and research into lo-fi screens and flows
4. Present synthesis/lo-fi visuals at design review (see [Lovell Federal lofi designs](https://preview.uxpin.com/93cf67f26d2b936504ffc415de7cf97fcb8d8e1c?_gl=1*12uwaf2*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE2NDgwNTUxMzkuQ2p3S0NBandpdXVSQmhCdkVpd0FGWEthTlA5M25BLTBsZlI4QTBtY3R6bEREZFB2bEIxWTJRcVZsdTdmc0UyT1VERlRSb3NybEc1UVVSb0NvQUlRQXZEX0J3RQ..#/pages/147178609/simulate/sitemap?mode=i) example)
5. Improve fidelity of screens and flows
6. Provide content for a-sync design feedback
7. Refine/finalize screens and flows
8. Conduct usability testing
9. Review feature in staging

### Design tools
  
- [Sketch for Teams](https://design.va.gov/documentation/designers#sketch-for-teams-at-va)
- UXPin
- Mural
- Github markdown
- Slack

### VA.gov collaboration cycle
- [VA Platform site collaboration cycle](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/index.html)
  - The Platform collaboration cycle site contains a general overview of the VA UX design process, as well as information on specific design touchpoints and milestones.
  - The [Touchpoints](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Touchpoints.1768423528.html) table contains the key milestones in our design process:
    - Design intent: a collaboration with other VA teams for feedback on content, acccessibility, and IA
    - Midpoint review: a follow up meeting with key specialists and stakeholders (not including smaller check-ins and updates)
    - Staging review: where designers work with engineers to ensure front-end implementation meets design standards
