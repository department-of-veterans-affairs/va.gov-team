# Medallia/Contact Center Data Review for VA.gov IA and Navigation

Goal: To understand what feedback we get in through Medallia or call center data around challenges people have navigating/finding tasks and tools on VA.gov, especially while signed in.

Data Analysis

### Sample responses:

-   Uploaded requested form VBA 20-0095 to my claim which you closed on the 15th of November.  This system has become convoluted and difficult to navigate through.  The process to add and file claims has placed more burden on the service member and give a sense of defeat and thrust the member into not wanting to file.  The system is broke.
-   I checked the status of my claim and it says there's a notice for information needed but I can't find any actual notice so I don't know what's needed.
-   schedule appt with primary provider. Appointment scheduler page cannot complete the task and presents a page with no slider bars to help navigate.
-   why is it always so hard to navigate the VA site??  Just trying make an appointment on line   Now I need to drive to the VA to make an appointment
-   I owe the VA money, but this website is of no help whatsoever.  You have so much stuff here but nothing to do with making payments.  Why do you have such an increadable difficult website?  And navigation is worse than trying to find a pea size rock in the Kyper Belt.
-   There is no map of the FDR Montrose VA campus on this page even though this page says "Campus Map." I thought it was my phone but then I tried with a desktop computer and there is no map. Please provide one, the campus is huge and confusing to navigate.
-   I'm trying to find the number to Community Care so I can talk to someone about one of my outside providers, but I can't find a single number that will get me to anyone I can talk to.
-   Attempting to process a travel pay request. This program is in no way set up for visually impaired/blind veterans. There are way too many screens to go through in the problem I have been having is is that the date is not being accepted on the processing line. I receive a message that the date format is incorrect? It seems to be not be a computer engineer our computer techie that there are way way too many pages to have to navigate. This program niece go back to the engineers and have them rewrite it.
-   Can't find the instructions for what I need to do, namely file travel pay for CC appointments.
-   Just trying to get Va  identification card. So I can get hearing checked. I am in system , filing disability claim, cannot navigate web site.
-   Change my password. Very very cumbersome, made worse by being forced into the difficult pw change process way too frequently. Getting lock out after 3 attempts to get through a difficult process compounds the headaches. The new navigation to access a specific service is not intuitive.
-   The login is very difficult. The navigation is very difficult. The instructions are not clear.
-   I have difficulty navigating security protocols to access online  system.it is also very difficult for me to get my Cpap supply and access to physical therapy and orthopedic car when badly needed I'm in a bad way
-   Very difficult to navigate, especially with a disability. Interface is none - intuitive and confusing.
-   To hard to navigate to find topic needed
-   Why can't I find an account statement sheet for a VAMC bill.
-   I can't find my current list of VA approved disabilities and the related percentage for each
-   I can't find what I want to find.
