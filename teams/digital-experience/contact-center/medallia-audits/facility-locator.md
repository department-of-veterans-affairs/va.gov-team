# Facility Locator Audit
**Platform Contact Center Team | December 2022**

## **Goal:**

The VA Platform Contact Center team is seeking to utilize data captured in Medallia surveys to help improve the user experience on products found on the [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) website. The primary metric the VA Platform Contact Center team is aiming to increase is task completion percentage, which is calculated through the Medallia feedback survey question “Were you able to do your task today?”

This audit analyzes Medallia feedback survey responses collected on pages within the Facility Locator product and provides recommendations based on these responses.

## **Identifying Key Terms**

Medallia can identify frequently used terms or themes within open text fields. Below is a list generated by Medallia on the top terms mentioned in responses collected from [VA.gov/find-locations](http://VA.gov/find-locations).

| **Theme**   | **Mention Volume** | **Positive** | **Negative** | **Neutral** |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ----------- |
| Va          | 683                | 1.2%         | 53.1%        | 40.7%       |
| Appointment | 494                | 0.8%         | 44.9%        | 47.6%       |
| List        | 392                | 1.3%         | 58.9%        | 35.2%       |
| Care        | 336                | 1.8%         | 53.0%        | 47.6%       |
| Location    | 285                | 1.4%         | 61.1%        | 34.4%       |

Exports were generated based on the following criteria:

- The response was submitted on [VA.gov/find-locations](http://VA.gov/find-locations)
- The respondent was unable to complete their task
- The respondent mentioned one of the key terms identified by Medallia

The responses from these exports were then analyzed and grouped into categories, which are listed below.

### **List / Location:**

**Missing or incomplete location**

- “My acupuncturist is not on the listing He is in network provider with VA/TriWest His information is as follows…”
- “I am a private sleep medicine practice and I want to be listed with community providers…”

**Inaccurate or outdated information**

- “My clinic contact phone number area code is wrong.”
- “Seeking oral surgeon, listed doctor does not accept assignments from the VA”
- “Urgent Care Locator for Jonesoborough, TN 37659 is incorrect. The first two listings, A and B (same location), are no longer an Urgent Care and the number is no longer in service.”
- “Find community care dental provider. Some providers listed do not participate in VA community care even though they're listed on the website.”

**Looking for the ability to print a list**

- “The search pulls up a list and a map, but you cannot print out the list or locations. Please add a print option with nice formatting at least with the list of providers if not a map.”
- “I needed a printable list of PCP”
- “I am trying to PRINT out a list of provider that are in the CCN network. It will not allow me to print a provider LIST for review ; will only print the first few providers and the map”

### **Appointment**

**Trying to schedule an appointment**

- “Make a emergency appointment for the dental lab.”
- “Check on appointment tbat was previously cancelled, and trying to make a new appointment for dermatology ASAP. I have a skin condition that ks getting worse and need to see a dermatologist ASAP. Unable to schedule anything around here. Never got a call back to reschedule previously cancelled appointment by VA.”
- “Schedule an appointment or at least get a referral to my dermatologist.”
- “Wanted to schedule an appointment. The map shows 2 facilities within 10 miles of my home in Spokane, WA, but when I try to schedule an appointment the closest one shows as 395 miles away!”

## Recommendations / Thoughts

### **Clearly define the scope of the tool**

- Is feedback concerning scheduling appointments relevant to the Facility Locator?
- Can it be used to schedule an appointment? If not, can users be clearly directed to a tool that can schedule an appointment? Or link to a resource article on how to schedule an appointment?

**Goal**
The purpose of this recommendation is to address the large volume of respondents leaving feedback concerning their personal appointments. If this feedback is inappropriately directed at the Facility Locator tool, it is negatively impacting the overall scores of the tool. If this feedback is appropriate, perhaps some adjustments can be made.

### **Consider adding the ability to print the list of results**

- Anecdotal research shows certain demographics prefer to have physical papers withrelevant information.
- This may assist in scheduling appointments if the user does not need to revisit the Facility Locator tool on repeated occasions to find additional numbers or locations.

**Goal**
The purpose of this recommendation is to address respondents looking to print the list of results. The inability to print the list of locations has garnered negative feedback, and has resulted in users stating they were unable to complete their task. 

### **How are inaccuracies handled?**

- Can users be affirmed that inaccuracies are being addressed or can be reported?

- Consider a custom feedback form and clarify that the form is not used to report inaccuracies (unless that is a potential intent of the form).

**Goal**
This is less of a recommendation and more of an opportunity to consider how inaccuracies are handled. A vast majority of responses pertaining to the Facility Locator are aimed at inaccurate or missing listings. This has a drastic impact on performance scores. Can there be a way to report inaccuracies? Is there a way to ensure to the end user that inaccuracies are being addressed? The default assumption seems to be that the VA is not handling any inaccurate information, which may not be true.
