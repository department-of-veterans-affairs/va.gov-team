## Categories
Medallia responses were exported and analyzed by members of the VA Platform Contact center team. The responses were then split into 4 segments, and 50 responses from each segment were reviewed and categorized. The four segments are as follows:
1. Intercept survey responses collected from any va.gov/find-form page where the respondent rated their experience negatively (1 or 2 on a scale of 5).
2. Feedback survey responses collected from any va.gov/find-form page where the respondent was unable to complete their task
3. Intercept survey responses collected from any va.gov page where the respondent mentioned any combination of the terms “find form” and rated their experience negatively (1 or 2 on a scale of 5).
4. Feedback survey responses collected from any va.gov page where the respondent mentioned any combination of the terms “find form” and the respondent was unable to complete their task

### Content
**Lack of information**<br />
Many respondents stated trouble determining how to submit their forms, whether that be digitally or through mail. This seemedto be one of the more common responses.
* “I have completed form 0877 and cannot find out what to do with it to register my business as veteran owned.”
* “While finding this firm was relatively easy the VA failed, as reliably done, to include where this form is to be sent by either mail, fax or email.”

**Checking Status**<br />
Respondents also commented on issues checking the status of a previously submitted form or claim.
* “Where do I find the status on form 21-8940 that the VA rep and I  filled out.?”


### Technical Issues
**Unable to verify ID**
* “Unable to verify my ID, I took multiple pictures of my ID/DL the system does not recognize it.”

**Broken Functinality or Links**
* “Web page needs serious updating; cells are hard too navigate in skip, move page down and the form in general is not user friendly. Further, it does not save your work when you close out requiring starting over. I was a CCNA and would put this in the bottom 10% of web page designs I have used.”
* “The forms do not tab correctly. Extremely frustrating.”
    * Note: this response was collected on https://www.va.gov/find-forms/?q=526ez

**Unable to open form or edit form**
* “I was trying to Complete 21-526EZ. The document will not open since the last update on 12Jan2023”
* Trying to edit-fill in the required information to complete form, however, Form is ‚ ‘Read Only’ per Adobe Acrobat.

### Findability
**Search issues**
Inability to find a form via search was one of the more commonly received responses.

* “The SEARCH feature could not find Form 21-4142. Also, a message came up saying there was a problem with the website.”
* “I'm trying to find a VA form. and despite it being a VA form, it says that no search matches that form number”

**General inability to find form**
* "I am NEVER able to find the forms I am looking for"
* "I have yet to ta able to find a form using this site. This has nothing to do with understanding or trust. You can't find a form. this doesn't work"


### Medical / Disability
**Disability related issues**
* “I wanted to be able to view and print the documents (files) that are part of my disability claim. although is could add new files, I could not click on the existing (uploaded) files. During the whole process I could not seem to find a way to print the actual claim form after answering the questions, and clicking on the boxes etc. to submit the claim.   I did appreciate seeing the progress of the claim, that is a great improvement over previous experience of just waiting until a decision is made. Thank you!”

**Medical related issues**
* “The structuring of the disability application is hard to understand, especially as it relates to what medical issues (primary/secondary). This is confusing. The drop down list should have only main topics - Head, Arm, Lung, Gastro/Stomach, Dermatology, Endocrinology, Orthopedic, etc... Once one of those sections are selected, it needs to bring you to a screen that says something, ‘Check all that apply’ or ‘Place a check next to all that apply’.  That list need to have all secondary to issues regarding Dermatology. i.e. acne, alopecia, eczema, dermatitis, etc.. Gastro/Stomach - check all that apply: IBS, Crohns, Diarrhea, Hemorrhoids, Anal Fissures, etc...Whatever a specialist covers all medical issues related to that specialty is secondary.  I honestly wish I could help rebuild the website to make it more user friendly.”


### Benefits
Responses regarding benefits were collected frequently, including GI benefits.
* “The links do not work.  The forms are hard to find.  It is an all around HORRIBLE experience every time I try to use the site or apply for missing benefits.  I have been trying for 12 years to obtain my father's benefits.”
* “can not find forms i need for pact benefits”
* “I wanted to find the status of my post 9/11 GI benefits and the form did not work.”


### Travel
Travel pay, or travel related issues, were very common response topics.
* “On-Line travel Reimbursement tool does NOT work.  Trying to email form instead and can not find email address anywhere!”
* “Find out which type of issue to fill out Question #12 on VA Form 20-0995 for review of a travel pay claim. There is NO info anywhere, not on the instructions, nor in this site.”
* “I cannot find the travel reimbursement form”


### Claims
* “I started filling out a form for a new claim, adding to my existing compensation. I cannot find the form I started yesterday nor do I know what it is called.”
* “Find my widows benefit claim! The forms say it would take 24-48 hours minus the weekend. It's been a week!!”

Of the above categories, the issues that received the most responses were:

* Lack of information
* Search
* Benefits
* Travel

## Observations
### Observation 1
**Veteran Feedback**<br /> 
“I am a CVSO VA accredited and I needed the updated VA form 21-0845 since we are suppose to use the "updated" forms in 2023”

**Summary Statement**<br />
Their needs to be a system put in place to have the updated forms properly added to the site. May need to have a separate feedback for incorrect forms submissions on the site.

### Observaton 2
**Veteran Feedback**<br />
* “I can't find how to (upload) submit a form 20-0995 online.”
* “Difficulty in finding where to electronically file forms for disagreement with VA decision and uploading new evidence as requested because the decision closed the case”
* “Tried filling out the VA Form 10-10EZR. I want to be able to fill it out online and send it electronically. To find a printer, sign it, and then mail it out is more of a hassle.”

**Summary Statement**<br />
Most forms on the Find a Form page lack the Online Tool option to submit the forms online. The need for online submissions would greatly aid veterans to submit their forms efficiently and stress free.

### Observaton 3
**Veteran Feedback**<br />
* “i was trying to open the VA Form 10-10EZR form to fill out and submit. was unable to do so. it only gave me the option to download the form, which i already have.”
* “Trying to edit-fill in the required information to complete form, however, Form is ‘Read Only’ per Adobe Acrobat.”

**Summary Statement**<br />
Many veterans are trying to fill out these forms using their computers. The site does inform the veteran to download and use adobe acrobat, but most of the common browsers and Windows/Mac settings are set to default to using the browsers Tab to load the document instead of saving/opening the document to the Adobe application. Which leads to the confusion of the veteran thinking they are using the Adobe application when filling it out. Will need to have clearer instructions on how to download the forms as well as set to default Adobe Acrobat as their primary pdf application.
