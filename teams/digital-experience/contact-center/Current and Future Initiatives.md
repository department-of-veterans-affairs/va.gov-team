## Current Team Objectives


### [Reduce the time it takes for Veterans to receive resolutions to their VA.gov technical problems](Link TBD) 
_Current Status:_ Actively working on this.  There are three key results we are looking to achieve:
1. Decrease the number of VA.gov Technical issues by 10% (compared to previous fiscal quarter)
2. 85% of VA.gov Technical issues closed within SLA
3. 50% of Tier 3 cases closed within 30 business days

For #1, our primary work to achieve this will involve _improving Veteran facing communication and informaation, KM creation and management processes, and developing the Login wizard tool._ All are in-progress at different stages.
For #2, our primary work to achieve this will involve _improving and implementing our coverage plan for support case management (not started) and a Salesforce email feature rollout (dependent on VEO)._ 
For #3, our primary work to achieve this will involve _creating tier 3 tracking and reporting process and tier 3 routing matrix._ Some work has been done on both fronts, but these need to be officially scoped and started.

**Key Information**
- We are mostly dependent on VFS teams (outside of our program) to achieve success on #1 and #2, however we can greatly impact this with providing data, processes, and follow-through. 
- The Login "Wizard" Self-Service Troubleshooting tool will be our first real software that we developed. This should impact both #1 and provide much need self-servicing to Veterans who have trouble logging in to VA.gov.

**What's next**
- We are beginning recruitment for phase 2 of our Login wizard research.
- Ideally, developement efforts can follow.
- Kimberley will lead efforts for #3. 

**Why does it matter?**  
Support for Veterans who experience issues while trying to complete tasks on VA.gov has been historically pretty terrible. While we have made vast improvements, there is plenty of ground to cover to realize goals (long-term) of having support which is on par with fortune 50 companies. Veterans deserve to have a seamless experience on VA.gov and fast support when anything goes wrong. 


### [Empower VFS teams to use customer feedback to impove VA.gov digital products and tools](Link TBD) 
_Current Status:_ Actively working on this.
We have create dashboards for user survey feedback and support (quantitative) data, and streamline processes for VFS teams to receive qualitative data on the VA network (due to PII/PHI concerns). Our goal here is to increase awareness and usability of the data so teams will use it to make their products better.

**Key Information**
- The VA Performance Dashboard has been a resource VA leaders have used to view and measure VA.gov user satisfaction. 
- We plan to rebuild this dashboard, starting in Q1 2023 for a variety of usability and maintenance concerns.
- Existing data within DOMO is more comprehensive, but still not holistic due to PII/PHI concerns.
- We have to provide free form text (qualitative) feedback manually on the network.
- We are dependent on VFS teams using the data to make some of these improvements, but we can do a better job of compelling them to

**Why does it matter?**  
The ultimate goal is for Veteran not to experience issues on VA.gov. Being proactive with data about persistent issues can help VFS teams fix widespread problems more quickly. 

**What's Next**  
A proof of concept of the Performance Dashboard and a plan for how to effectively communicate data with VFS team such that they are compelled to improve their product based on that data.
