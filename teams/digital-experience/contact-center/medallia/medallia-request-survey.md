# How to request a Medallia survey

**Summary:** this document outlines Medallia _Feedback_ surveys and how you can request one for your Veteran-facing service.

**Background:** What is a Medallia survey? Medallia is the tool we use to receive veteran feedback on VA.gov. Data from Medallia is shared with the VEO, is in compliance with PRA, and the template below has pre-approved platform design and content.

## How to request a survey

Fill out the `User Survey - Request Template`in Zenhub

The issue will be triaged to the VSP Contact Center team and will be implemented in Staging based on the URLs provided. Once approved by the VFS product manager or product owner in staging, the survey will be pushed to Production and the issue will be closed after another approval.

Please allow 1-2 sprints for the survey to be implemented, depending on the complexity.

## Surveys

We currently have one recommended survey for Veteran-facing Services: 

- Floating feedback button on the right hand side of specific URLs
- Lightbox element
- Questions:
1. What task were you trying to do today?
  - [Free text]
2. Were you able to do your task today?
  - Yes
  - No
3. What is your overall satisfaction with this site? 
  - 1 = Very dissatisfied
  - 5 = Very satisfied

We recommend the above survey templates to create consistency across va.gov services. If you have any questions, please reach out to the VSP contact center team on the DSVA Slack channel, #vfs-platform-support, and begin your message with `VA.gov survey inquiry`.
