# Overview
On the Rated Disabilities app we present the Veteran with a table that shows the disabilities they have on file with the VA. During a 508 review it was reccomended that we add sorting to the table so that Veterans can sort the disabilites by variaous criteria.

## Hypothesis
Sorting is only valuable on certain apps and is very context specific. We don't believe sorting will be valuable to the Veteran on the Rated Disabilities app since the data is not hierarchical nor is it generally a large amount of data, usually 5-10 disabilities listed.

## Test versions
- **Control** - Current app with no sorting available
- **Variant A** - The current app with a drop down added to the top of the table for the Veteran to choose what to sort the table by

## Goal
We have deternimed that if 10% of Veterans in Variant A use the sorting feature we will impliment it perminantly on the page.

- Target statistical significance - NA, conversion rate does not apply
- Sample Size - 400,000
- Test timing - Aprox 1 month
