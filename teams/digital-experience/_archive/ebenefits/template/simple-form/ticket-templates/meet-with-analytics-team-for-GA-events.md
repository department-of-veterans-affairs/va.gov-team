## Goal
In order to track the success metrics for the [Form Name] form we need to get Google Analytics events set up that speak to those metrics. So that the analytics team has a chance to establish those event names and what they are for we need to meet with them either in person or over Slack.

## Tasks
- [ ] Connect with the GA/Insights Team (over either Slack or Zoom) to share what function and features this product is involved with, and a recommendation for what events they might be interested in tracking.
- [ ] Document what events will be provided by the analytics team

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] We have connected with the GA/Insights Team 
- [ ] We have a document (ticket or otherwise) that has all of the GA events needed for [Form Name]

### Next steps
-  [ ] Code provided by the GA/Insights Team has been inserted into our feature
