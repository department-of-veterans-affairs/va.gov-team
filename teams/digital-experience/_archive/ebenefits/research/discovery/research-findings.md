2. eBenefits is a trusted educational/informational resource for Veterans.
3. There is a need for benefit eligibility information to be more immediately available.
4. The current user paths around authorization and login are potential barriers to Veteran access to eBenefits.
### There are at least three eBenefits user-types
#### Power User
The Power User spends time in eBenefits browsing and learning about new opportunities. 
- They may also serve as a Facilitor, and help educate other veterans through: social media (Facebook), word of mouth, at work (if they are a VA employee) to their clients
- Power Users are refer to eBenefits often for documentation and self service tools like the claim status tracker (the tool is named Work in Process, but users referred to it as the Claim Status Progress or Tracker)
- They usually have the eBenefits site bookmarked or saved for easy access.
- As a Facilitator, they want the valuable information they find "accidentally" to be surfaced instead of navigating around the site to find it
- The Power User may have considerable VA benefits and has a need to review and manage benefits often.
#### Occasional/Convenience User
The Conveience User has a specific goal or task in mind when using the site.
- Convenience users are referred to tools or documents within eBenefits from someone else or through email
- They have specific URLs within eBenefits saved in a document or bookmarked in their browser
- They primarily use the dashboard to complete actions like adding dependents, changing personal information or checking claim status
- They will access eBenefits only occasionally; and the site may have changed in their absence.
#### Facilitator
The Facilitator is familiar with eBenefits as a user, but is in a position to refer and guide others. This position may be professional--such as a VA or VSO employee; or it may be informal--such as a friend or guide (as someone who's been there).
- Facilitators are different from Power Users in there personal use of eBenefits. 
  - Personally, Facilitators use eBenefits occasionally.
  - However, they may have a wide general understanding of the site.
- Facilitators will share knowlege verablly in informal settings.
- They may use social media to share knowledge.
- In a professional environment, Facilitators may walk-through or show screens, usually in person.
- Participants who were Facilitators seemed to have a solid general knowledge of VA benefits and the eBenefits site.
- Sometimes Facilitator participants were not completely current with the state of the eBenefits site.
### eBenefits is a trusted educational/informational resource for Veterans
- Veterans who visit eBenefits often use the "learn" tab in the header to discover helpful information:
  - Education & home loan benefits were the top mentioned benefits that Veterans learned about through eBenefits
- Veterans are usually referred to specific tools or documents within eBenefits 
- Useful information on eBenefits is "stumbled upon" as a result of browsing the site
- Facilitor user-types will recommend eBenefits to Veterans
### There is a need for benefit eligibility information to be more immediately available
- Veteran often rely on word-of-mouth and accidental discovery to find benefits they are entitled to.
- Some participants cited a need to have a 'one-stop' list or accounting of benefits a Veteran is entitled to.
- The feeling is the VA has all the info needed to determine a Veteran's benefits.

## For Consideration
#### Investigate ways to streamline authorization/login
- Far and away, login is the most prevalent and frustrating pain point discussed in the interviews; it was nearly unanimous.
- Minimize linking back and forth between eBenefits and VA.gov.
- Migrate features in a way to reduce or eliminate lining across sites.
#### Create a more cohesive transition plan in migrating eBenefits features to VA.gov
- May include 'inbound' visitor messaging on VA.gov.
- Consideration given to alerting users when a link will cross domains.
#### Better tier information to support users' tendencies
- Surface genreal view-only information earlier in user paths.
- Consider the value of (truncated) high-level info as tiles in a dashboard arrangement.
- Preserve profile/dashboard screen layout to consolidate benefits info into single hub/view.
- Allow drill-down points to detailed info for power users.
- Create natural 'off-ramp' links to action items from informational views.
- Understand the value of eBenefits' educational component and preserve links to up-to-date, accurate information.
#### Consider data sources during migration
- Consolidate viewable and editable data around a single 'source of truth' that's consistent across VA.gov
- Pre-fill forms and data by default.
- Offer opportunities to correct/add to/edit info where it is presented.
- Document multiple varying data sources; consider consolidation or syncing data across sources.
