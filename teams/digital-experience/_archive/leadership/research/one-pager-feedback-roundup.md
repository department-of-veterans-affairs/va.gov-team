# VSP One Pager feedback

The following are the themes that emerged from presenting the Platform one-pager document to DEPO product owners and designers.

## 1. Stakeholders will see what's important to them
> If you plan to share this with VA stakeholders they will focus on things they care about.

> Having a list of 18 equally presented things may not align to prioritization that business stakeholders have in mind - tailor to the stakeholder (3-4 things) and focus on those

> There may be a few things that everyone should know (24/7 monitoring for example) but other things to choose from to highlight.

> If you can address the reality of their situation, things that are keeping them up at night, that resonates

#### Ideas
- a. Make the presentation customizable for the audience
- b. Categorize platform offerings in ways that make sense for stakeholders (time savings, cost savings, compliance, lowering effort, etc)

## 2. Stakeholders have vague ideas of what the platform is in its broadest sense, which leads to anxiety about building on it

**Vague ideas and unanswered questions**

> The question I hear most is, “When you say platform, what do you mean specifically?”

>  All of these are checkpoints right?

> Real talk goes farther than shiny talk: _You are giving up some control here but here is why, here is what you get in return_

> They want to know how they can sell it to their leadership.

> [Stakeholder] wants to know what you mean by "automated tests." What do you get?

> Building on the platform, vs not building on the platform - what do I get?

**Anxiety about building on the platform**

> They consider it an oversight, a slow down.

> "I’m gonna get $3m next year to get a team to build this, now told I have to get them to work on the platform, now I have to work with my contracting team + your platform team"

> I have to go four levels down?

> This is a lot of oversight. 

> I could see the potential for platform being a blocker

#### Ideas
- a. Clarify what the platform is using straightforward, repeatable language stakeholders are familiar with
- b. Consider incorporating stakeholder-focused problem statements
- c. Consider using language from the directives of Devops and HCD
- d. Have a full list of well-defined platform offerings as an appendix we can point to if questions come up

## 3. It's unclear how teams and stakeholders will interact with the platform

> When do I come to you? When am I supposed to come to you?

> There are lots of checkpoints that need to happen on the platform side to allow the apps side to continue on with their momentum. I don’t think I understand how that will work.

> How am I interacting with the platform?

> They will find value in seeing the responsibilities spelled out

> Stakeholders also need to see themselves in this [process] in some way.

> This tells me I own this [product] forever, there’s no off-ramp? Do I go in this cycle forever?

#### Ideas
- a. Consider incorporating a success story (or snippets of ideal examples - screenshots of Slack conversations, Zenhub tickets?) that we can use to demonstrate interactions over time [do we have one?]
- b. Consider pushing on the timeline layout with the stakeholder experience incorporated

### Specific copy and design feedback
- c. Change Content Management System to “Content Management Process” to better reflect current reality [done](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q2QZIJXH6nSAzdVlANUd1Mt1KVFFiL1uRZgWSsXucJg/edit#slide=id.g5f8284ca61_0_325)
- d. Won’t be able to read details / see from back of room (of slide 8) [to do](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsp-5cedc9cce6e3335dc5a49fc4/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/3729)
- e. From a purely visual perspective, need to bump up contrast” (greys) [to do](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsp-5cedc9cce6e3335dc5a49fc4/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/3729)
- f. Reframe verbiage from “you, the VFS team” to stakeholder [to do](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsp-5cedc9cce6e3335dc5a49fc4/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/3729)
- g. Maybe use plainer terms than VSP and VFS acronyms - product team vs. platform team. [done](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q2QZIJXH6nSAzdVlANUd1Mt1KVFFiL1uRZgWSsXucJg/edit#slide=id.p1)
- h. If we want to convey that this is more iterative than waterfall… well, it still looks  like a waterfall that was just made circular
