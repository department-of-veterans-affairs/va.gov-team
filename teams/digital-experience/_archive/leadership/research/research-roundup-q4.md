### Goal
To gauge how effective the KPI workshops are with VFS teams.

### Key takeaways
- Prior to the workshop, teams had begun discussing pain points and objectives, but had not solidified plans for how to measure their improvements.
- After the workshop, 8/10 participants felt confident about their team's approach to setting KPIs
- Teams expect having collectively set KPIs will help them stay focused and guide their roadmaps
- Workshop served as catalyst to discussions that had started, and help move teams forward to action. 2 participants described next steps as narrowing down the list of metrics to the most critical to track, another described setting up metrics to gather baseline data.

**How might we...**
- Follow up with teams to see if they took the next steps they described?
