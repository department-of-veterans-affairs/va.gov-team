The [on-call](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/tree/master/OnCall) directory in va.gov-team-sensitive is the primary source of information for on-call documentation, including [Incident Categorization](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/OnCall/incident-categorization.md).

The [Emergency Contacts / Information](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops#emergency-contacts--information) section of the devops repo, specifically the [Incident Response Playbook](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/docs/Incident%20Response%20Playbook.md) is an additional source of quality information.

External Service Integration documentation lives in both the [devops repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/tree/master/docs/External%20Service%20Integrations) and [va.gov-sensitive](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/OnCall/services.md)

[PagerDuty](https://dsva.pagerduty.com/schedules) is the authoritative source for the on call schedule. If you do not have access to PagerDuty and need to know who's on call, join the #oncall channel in DSVA Slack.
