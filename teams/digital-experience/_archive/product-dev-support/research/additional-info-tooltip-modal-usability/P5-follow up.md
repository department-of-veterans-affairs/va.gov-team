# P5 Follow up - Learn more

Thursday, December 5, 1:00pm ET




## Intro - 5 minutes

**Moderator:** Thanks for joining us today! My name is Crystabel. Emily had talked to you before, but she's on vacation now so I will be running our feedback today. I also have a colleague on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the current “learn more” experience. Sometimes when filling out the form online, people need to get a little more information on filling out the form and we’re thinking of the most effective way to display that to them. We have a couple different ways to get your feedback on. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

This entire session should take about 1 hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

**Moderator:** Are you comfortable if I record your screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. Is it ok if I record the screen today?

Yes

**Moderator:** I'm recording now, can I confirm it's ok?

Yes

*Start recording*



## Share your screen
**Moderator:** Great. Before we get started, I'd like you to share your screen with me. In Zoom, can you select the Share button?

Sure






## First Task: Test the modal pattern in staging - 10 minutes [only need to test 1 modal]
**Moderator:** Do you have the link from Shannon?  (https://staging.va.gov/gi-bill-comparison-tool/).

That one?

**Moderator:** Yes, this one

I remember last time we had a little trouble with this page

**Moderator: **We have a form here for our GI Bill comparison tool. The purpose of this tool is to help Veterans compare costs at colleges and universities they are interested in, so they can estimate how to use their GI Bill benefits.

**Moderator:** Would you mind going through the page and before clicking on anything, tell me what it's asking you to do.

*Screenreader reads page*

Basically, it went through the typical title page. There were 2 links and foms that I can fill out to focus my search.

**Moderator:** Awesome. Thanks for explaining that to me. Before clicking, how would you go about getting information if you needed it?

I could go through the links or there was a combo box?

**Moderator:** Go ahead and select one.

*Modal pops up*

**Moderator:** Is this what you expected to find?

Oh, I'm completely out of the window... I clicked "x" out of the pop-up and it crashed.

**Moderator:**Could you select your answer after reading it?

*Selects Post 9/11*

**Moderator:** Do you remember what you read after you exited out of it?

The pop-up didn't give me a ton of information, it just said made a selection to get more info. Honestly, that Learn more is kind of a waste unless it give more info for each.

**Moderator:** Gotcha

The learn more link was a waste of time to go to

**Moderator:** That's great feedback. Why do you think this content is hidden behind a learn more link?

Maybe I missed this link the first time. I didn't read the instructions. I just hit the space bar to exit out of it.




## Second Task: Test the accordion pattern in Codepen - 10 minutes
**Moderator:** Back in the email that Shannon sent, please click on the second link: https://codepen.io/tpierce_402/full/PoYVKKa

**Moderator:** What we’re going to look at next is a prototype of two other ways to get more information while filling out an online form. 

**Moderator:** First, without making any selections, scan first question on the page and describe what it’s asking you to do.

*Screenreader reads page*

I'm guessing it's a form asking how I want to take classes.

*Opens learn more dropdown - screenreader reads*

**Moderator:** Was your instinct to open the Learn More link?

For that one, I automatically clicked learn more. If I had vision in terms of reading the words on screen. They've changed to now they have to be on on the VHA rates. I'd like to see more detail on that, 'cause that's real generic. What's the requirement?

**Moderator:** How would you compare the interaction of this learn more compared to the other?

This is much better than a popup.

**Moderator:** Why?

I don't have to listen or wonder do I have to hit space bar to get out of? Personally I'd like the learn more after my choices. Here's your choices, do you want to learn more now?

**Moderator:** That's great feedback!

Reads "What types of learning are you interested in??

**Moderator:** What woud you do here?

I don't want to check it, I want to learn more - opens learns more

**Moderator:** Is this what you'd expect to find?

Yes, um possible. The private training thing I always question. People are doing weird private training. Don't know if it's legitimate.

**Moderator:** How does this compare with the previous Learn More link?

This seems like a second link. It's nice that it didn't read it and I had to click it. I don't know if that's nice.

For ease of use, the first option was easier.

### Learn more pattern in a tooltip:
**Moderator:** Next, I’m going to ask you to scroll a little farther down the page until you get to a label that says “Javascript tooltip.” Please read the question underneath and without making any selections, describe what it’s asking. 

**Moderator:** Before clicking anything, describe how would you go about getting more information about this question, if you needed it? Is this what you expected?

It just started to read. So... Yeah.

The interesting part with that is it just said learn more. Is the Enter a date... is that in the Learn more in the box? I honestly would put the text in parentheses and not put the learn more there. It's pretty self explanatory 

**Moderator:** Compared to the first two options, which way did you find it most effective?

Not the pop-up. The next one (the accordion) i liked it.

This one (tooltip) it popped-up and just read it and I'm not sure if I clicked it. I didn't like this one.

**Moderator:** Any additional thoughts?

Not really, as you can tell, the title at the top reads all of that. Is there a way to skip reading all that? It gets  tiring that every page you go to it reads the whole top title bar. If you're on the landing page that's great, but as I get into the info it's gets tiring.

**Moderator:** That's great feedback!

**Moderator: **Okay that wraps up the items we wanted to get your feedback on today. Do you have any questions or additional thoughts about the things we evaluated?

No

**Moderator:** Thank you so much. This has been a really helpful session.

*You can now stop sharing your screen*
