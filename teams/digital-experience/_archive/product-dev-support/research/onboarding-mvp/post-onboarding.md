* 1 - Windows

### What was the biggest challenge you faced during onboarding? (Please be honest and detailed -- this will help us improve the onboarding process for future teams)

* DELUGE of information, provided in so many different places. Having to go to many, many links — especially with the repo reorg — is confusing and hard to keep organized without losing data. I noticed efforts to compile them, but they seemed to be happening as I joined, so sometimes things weren't complete or had 404s, and I joined an urgent project that was also taking off.
* Some of the sessions were a little rushed or hard to hear as a grou
* Trying to get it to work on the Windows GFE before By Light bought us Macs.
* I received a lot of information in multiple meetings but it was confusing how it all went together. I think the kickoff meeting could have provided more clarity.
* Understanding the separation of teams/interests. This is still not always clear, but it affected following the documentation in various repositories. The documentation can be very circular - but after a while it started falling into place.
* Obtaining CAG access and PIV card issues. I know it's a lengthy process but not having updates makes you feel like nothing is moving along.
* Acquiring software
* Need to streamline the info a little better for clear communication and expectations across teams. Overall pretty good!
  
### Now that you’ve started working on VA.gov, what were you missing during onboarding that would have made the transition smoother?

* Honestly, I still feel like I don't have everything I need. I was only able to attend some of the onboarding due to the other project's start. Onboarding to Ad Hoc, the program, and projects all at the same time, there's a tornado of information. Each would benefit from a complete onboarding document, but I also recognize the challenges.
* Deeper dives to include more GitHub and pull requests training.
* It was all there, but not knowing what a lot of it meant, by the time you need to actually use the information you can't remember where it was located in the documentation. Documentation seems to be a moving target that is not all really in one place (yet).
* A simple list of the tasks we were asked to do showing why and where it fit in to the big picture. Documentation was thorough and very helpful if you could find it. It was very difficult to find the documentation you were looking for in Git.
* Our team in the beginning struggled with attempting to use our GFE/Windows based machines which couldn't easily be done. At first a lot of time was spent standing up virtual linux machines to do the onboarding/work but in the end we switched to Macs - which was easier. Bill Tran has created an out of the box Vagrant machine that can be used in a Windows GFE - that would have helped a lot in the beginning.
* I am still missing CAG access and a working PIV card.
* Onboarding was very smooth for me - people were helpful and information was clearly presented. Hardware sent was incorrect (Macbook had someone else's profile installed and no software) but was quickly resolved by support.
* Just better direction on how to complete various task by assigning specific team members to communicate with regarding each are of focus to complete during as a part of on-boarding.

### After onboarding, how soon were you able to contribute to your team’s goal(s)?

* 3 - A few days
* 2 - 1 week
* 0 - 2 weeks
* 1 - 3-4 weeks
* 2 - over a month

### Was there something that prevented you from contributing sooner? If so, what?

* I think one week is pretty great!
* No, but some things werre trickier than others because we don't have PIV access to VA and can't send calendar invites to DSVA, access Drupal, etc.
* Just the GFE issue really.
* There were a lot of hoops to jump through attempting to use my Windows GFE. Once I received a Mac I had to set that up for the project too.
* Coming up to speed with all fo the different technologies (still ongoing). This is a departure from an classic Enterprise application system and there are various new technologies to consume and become proficient with.
* There wasn't work for me to do just yet since everyone was still onboarding. There still isn't a substantial amount because most of what I need to do is in Drupal and I still don't have access to it because of PIV card issues.
* No.
* No.

### What documentation did you find most helpful?

* The VSA onboarding document, which took a couple of weeks to be completed, but once it was it was super helpful.
* insights / analytics
* Environment setup. And taking a React/Redux course at Udemy.
* Getting started was helpful for development.
* Developer Docs - FE and BE
* The onboarding tickets that Nick Sullivan provided for different fields of the project.
* Onboarding guide and Design system resources
* N/A

### Are there processes you don’t fully understand. If so, which ones? (Ex. 508 accessibility audit, pull request creation)

* Setting up my dev environment — but I hope to do that after this next sprint, or in a lull during it, and have a fellow dev to assist if needed.
* most people still do not know how to do pull requests and how they are done and what needs to be reviewed, etc.
* End-to-end testing, approvals. Since I'm just now getting the code close to being ready I'm nervous about going through whatever the rest of the process is. It wasn't clear to me from onboarding. Again, I think you have to go through it at least once before it will make sense. I think an experienced person should pair-program with a new person for 100% of their first project, start-to-finish.
* I don't know. Haha. I think I have a good grasp on things now.
* Yes, many - but it is a matter of being involved with them - our work has consistent of a lot of research with some commits/pulls so far - as we do more I believe the processes will become clearer. ByLight has focus in other projects within MHV so the context switching is difficult to immerse ourselves in Digital Services - as we do more, it will become easier to work within these frameworks/processes.
* Google Analytics, 508 accessibility, the correct order of issues/PRs/documentation when creating a new branch of a page.
* I am familiar and comfortable with most design processes now.
* Pull request creation

### Is there any other feedback you have?

* I think there will always be exceptions, which I think I was one, so having the Ad Hoc onboarding nailed down is helpful. All of the benefits onboarding, a checklist would be helpful, instead of a string of emails. I'm still grateful for search in Slack, which has been really helpful.
* overall I thought it was excellent and something that was never done on any program I have been on previously.
* I think I put it on my last question: You should not have to do your first project alone and be expected to ask questions on Slack and know what to ask and who to ask. You should be paired with an experienced engineer (peer) who will work the entire project with you from start-to-finish and show you each step of the processes and help you do the first one. After that you should be fine.
*	Everyone is very helpful!! They made me feel comfortable to ask stupid questions.
* I'd like to have an idea of the different teams working within va.gov and their focus - and then the overarching management groups - this is still fuzzy to me, it was never clear. I may have overlooked some documentation describing the different teams because I was so focused on getting a FE and BE running within my environment.
* It would be helpful to explain in onboarding that the process can take a while and it's understood there is not going to be a quick flow of work when first starting. It's sometimes hard to know if there is work one should be doing or if it's just a matter of waiting till everyone is fully onboarded.
* My onboarding was very smooth and quick. My Product Manager was very pro active in getting me the necessary information and helped me to the current processes.
* Overall great job.

### How often did you have to reach out to platform teams for support? And if so for what?

* I don't recall, I'd say a dozen times, to find out what the requirements were for research process among other things.
* mostly Content IA team as they are still the only ones with access.
* Often. I'm not 100% done finishing my first project so I'm not sure what else I'll have to ask how to do. But I just needed a lot of hand-holding figuring out where the code was and how it worked.
* At least every few days for the first few weeks. There were multiple times that I was asked to click on a link and sign up for something leaving me to ask "Why am I signing up for this? What is it? How will this be used?"
* Often - getting environments working (vets-website FE and vets-api BE), requirements - and in debugging code and finding components/properties needed for business requirements in the functionality, etc.
* I never did.
* One or two times a week to get design guidance on how to best use the design system.
* Somewhat often. Typcially for permission access and scheduling on-boarding tasks.

### When you reached out for support, how responsive and helpful were the teams?

* Lightning fast!
* very responsive and always helpful
* Very. I was extremely pleased and appreciative.
* Very helpful!
* VERY
* NA
* Very responsive
* Very helpful

### Anything you think could be improved with the code review process?

* n/a at this time
* I think we need a session dedicated to that. There are a lot of tickets in validate on our zenhub board because no one knows who or how to review code.
* Not applicable.
* Not at this time.
* not at this time - as stated I haven't had any work I've personally done reviewed
* Not sure I understand this question.
* n/a
* N/A

### Are there any tools that you expected to see or that your team uses often that we didn't have?

* Expected to have my own Zoom account, Mural, and a way of collaborating in spreadsheets that DSVA, GCIO, Oddball, Ad Hoc, and any other vendors can work in. If it's O365, fine. We need to be able to collaborate in spreadsheets. They're as vital as codebases.
* not that I can think of
* No.
* No
* No, this is all a new technology stack for me
* No
* No - almost have all of my tools installed :-)
* N/A
