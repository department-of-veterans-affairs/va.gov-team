Overall, focusing on Onboarding is more important in immediate term than Intake

## Onboarding MVP must include...
- Meetings w/full VFS team, VA stakholders, and VSP support team
- Process for getting VFS team members into bi-weekly practice area meetings and Slack channels
- Separate break-out for Engineering-specific best practices / expectations

## Consider including in MVP...
- Including launch criteria in full team onboarding
- Including way to facilitate getting quick access to necessary systems
- Identifying where connections to people at external services would be helpful

## Next iteration
- Product Bootcamp and/or other practice-area specific break outs
- Automated / self-service system access
