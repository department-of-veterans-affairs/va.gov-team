# Initial brainstorm:
[In fun retro](https://funretro.io/publicboard/FGvqN50clhOIIFWwTy6kxveNWy63/3dad7596-1238-4a87-8365-1e68121876f7)

# Deeper dive:

What is the benefit of smaller teams?
- Makes all ceremonies more efficient. "2 pizza rule" carries throughout all ceremonies. When you become so big it's harder to collaborate and come together and hard to get through the ceremonies, a lot more time in meetings.
- A 10 person team (prod, design, FE, BE, content, IA x 2, QA, 508, ATO) - is that too big?
- Merging the 2 teams is on the border of too much... so let's look more into the other pros and cons

Heavy diversity of practice areas on a team can be fractifying, but can also help with collaboration
- For ex) last retro was really Eng heavy.
- Not possible to "SWARM" in the same way, but perhaps just a mental shift?
- W/o a second person working on the same thing (like 508) it's harder to spike by adding ppl, you have to look for other ways. Which has resulted in ppl picking up different skills, like Peter picking up 508 audits. Cross-training in each others' roles.
- As long as knowledge transfer is willing, it's great

Smaller teams make it easier for VFS Teams to know who to go to for what
- It has been easy for Peggy to respond to content questions bc ppl know exactly what channel to go to. Haven't gotten feedback that it's confusing but there's a lot of stuff they're going through as they're onboarding and some can be overwhelming. Volume of different Slack channels may be confusing, and VFS Teams not knowing where to go for certain questions.

A lot of efforts overlap btwn the 2 teams, lots of collab needed (for ex: va.gov-team repo strategy + implementation)
- IA, in mission to set new IA, missed a lot of the convos on Prod Dev Support team 
- The "Portal", both teams had "portal" activities but on paper wasn't clear how the actual activities split

Lack of awareness about broader goals
- The space is really new to a lot of people
- It's hard to gain understanding of the larger objectives we're trying to achieve w/o working closely with the folks on Product Support
- Great way to get up to speed is through exposure, and have access to the conversations. Hard do to that when not on that team.
- Also Content & IA is missing a PM right now, unsure how big a part of the challenge that is. Could be useful if that person were to identify and create opportunities for cross-team collab, but just having them on the team wouldn't in and of itself make the lack of broad goal awareness better.

Updating documentation
- Some of it goes to Tools team, and some of it might be Product Support stuff. Who's responsible for maintaining and creating documentation?
- Maybe we set a team to be responsible, but they rely on the work of other teams. But someone needs to take charge of the cross-team asks.

## Possible Solution Approaches

1. Re-structure teams
2. Keep teams the same, and implement different / new process

Let's explore!

### 1. Re-structure teams

*One option*
- Engineering Support Team: product, FE,  BE, 508, ATO, QA
- UX Support Team: product, content, ia, design

Notes:
- Today primarily collab for IA is with product, content, and design/ux. And secondarily with eng. In the past, we never had a full time designer on the team and it always felt like a gap. Who'll take the architecture and make it into something we can look at / touch / feel?
- Content & IA do have to interact w/Design/UX a lot... 
- 3rd echo of this ^
- Might not resolve the issue of not knowing how the IA work is contributing to Eng support mission
- Sometimes w/o engineers on the team it's hard to implement, so may have same issues as before
- Daily interactions that have been going on have happened w/o necessarily being on the same teams... but it might make things easier to be on the same page about team goals and objectives
- Would losing Design be a hamper on the Eng Support Team?
- This would open up a question about who owns onboarding...


### 2. Keep teams the same, and implement different / new process
- Joint plannings, PMs working more closely together, more concretely defined missions and roadmaps

Notes:
- If we do all our planning together, and our PMs are working closely together, does that then make us one team? haha
- Even if we do restructure teams, there will still probably be a need for better cross-team collaboration. 

# Decisions
- Start by implementing better cross-collab process and PMs working closely together
- Check back in after a 5 weeks (around Sept 18th, so the team has 2 full sprints to see how things go w/better process before coming back to discuss) to see if things are organically forming toward a natural cleavage
- Teams will grow in the near future too, so ^ this ^ means we avoid merging and then resolving with a huge team
