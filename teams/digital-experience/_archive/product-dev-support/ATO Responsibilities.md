# VSP Authority to Operate (ATO) Lead Mission

Ensure that VSP and the VSP-hosted applications across VA.gov have the Authority to Operate. And, equally as important, ensure that VSP's ATO process doesn't impede the culture of agile, iterative product development.

# Areas of focus

1) Clean up VSP ATO (so VSP/VA.gov has full ATO, and so we're not maintaining the "duplicative" vets.gov one as well)
2) Move VSP ATO to the split model (so VSP has a base ATO that covers some cross-VA.gov things, and VFS Teams are responsible for the ATO of their specific products)  
3) Define process by which VFS Teams contribute to ATO
4) Support VFS Teams by answering questions and providing guidance as they take care of their own ATO

# Roadmap
NOW
- Hang out on the Tools team, to meet with those engineers, understand how vets-api works, what kind of data we consume, how that data is used across VA.gov. 
- Meet with Brian Gryth for knowledge transfer of the current state of our ATO and how to navigate Risk Vision
- Meet with Operations Engineers to understand how they use the various info reported/recorded in Risk Vision
- Make necessary adjustments to the documentation in Risk Vision so that VSP/VA.gov has a clean ATO, and so that we do not have the duplicative vets.gov ATO still out there 

NEXT
- Move over to the more permanenent team: Product Development Support.
- Draft plan for transitioning our ATO to a split model (so VSP has a base ATO that covers some cross-VA.gov things, and VFS Teams are responsible for the ATO of their specific products)
- Take necessary actions to transition to split ATO model
- Write up process for VFS Teams to get ATO for their individual products, given the new split model
- Verify that all VA.gov products have appropriate ATO, and if they don't work w/Product Owners so they know how to get it
- Meet w/new VFS Teams so they understand what they're responosible for ATO-wise
- Answer questions from VFS teams about ATO as they come up in Slack

FUTURE
- Iterate on process based on any pain points or happy points  we discover as VFS Teams go through it
- Collaborate with Tools team to incorporate reasonable ATO checks in automated testing
