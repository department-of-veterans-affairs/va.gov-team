## How we work

### Product Management

#### Board
All work is managed under the [Platform- Product Support](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/platform---product-support-5f85b91c14d8df0018fac414/board?repos=133843125,154174777&showEstimates=false&showMilestones=false&showEpics=false&showReleases=false&showDependencies=false) board in Zenhub.

#### Label
All work performed by Platform Product Support team will have the `vsp-product-support` label in github/zenhub.

#### Pipelines
- **Backlog:** Default pipeline for all new work. Anything that has not yet been picked up for a specific sprint or is in need of refinement.
- **Icebox:** This pipeline is not used often, however it is for low priority, un-prioritized issues that are not immediate priorities.
- **Now Initiatives:** High level initiatives for the current quarter. Issues in this pipeline are always at the Epic level. 
- **Upcoming Initiatives:** High level initiatives for an upcoming quarter. Issues in this pipeline are always at the Epic level.
- **Feedback:** This pipeline contains issue tickets written by Platform Product Support team members assigned to other VFS teams as part of Collaboration Cycle (this piepline will be retired as new tickets should not include the 'vsp-product-support' label.
- **Upcoming CC Reviews:** Upcoming issue tickets (or touchpoints) for the Collaboration Cycle created by VFS teams. This represents the current workload for the Collaboration Cycle.
- **Completed CC Reviews:** Completed issue tickets (or touchpoints) for the Collaboration Cycle created by VFS teams. Platform does not mark any Collaboration Cycle tickets as closed (that is the responsibility of the VFS team) so tickets will remain in this pipeline until VFS action is taken.
- **Planned:** Issue tickets ready to be worked on this sprint or the upcoming sprint.
- **In Progress:** Issue tickets currently being worked on.
- **Review/QA:** Completed issue tickets awaiting peer review, PM approval and/or PO review.
- **Closed:** Completed and closed out issues.

### Workflow + Cadence

#### Stand-up
Check in on people and product progress

- Monday, Wednesday, Friday at 12 pm Eastern. 
- 30 min
- Format: Review weekly [Standup Agenda](https://vfs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PPST/pages/1762492421/Product+Support+-+Standup+Agenda) and discuss urgent items

#### Sprint Creation
Finalize objectives and goals for the upcoming sprint.

- Every other Monday at 3 pm Eastern
- 30 minutes
- Finalize sprint objectives and write the Sprint Report

#### Sprint Planning
Outline work to be done this sprint in order to accomplish the team's goals

- Every other Wednesday at 2 pm Eastern
- 1 hour
- Review sprint objectives and then plan the sprint. 

#### Retro

#### Refinement
Assess and update workload for remainder of sprint

#### Issue Etiquette
For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):

- Estimate
- Title that explains task
- User Story
- Description with Background
- Acceptance Criteria
- Label: 'vsp-product-support'
- Nested in an Epic (if applicable)

All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

#### Team Norms

- Be respectful, both online and off
- Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
- Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
- We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
- Let’s have fun and do great work!

#### Slack:

This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.

Channels:
- **#vsp-product-support-team** This is our main team channel and is used for all internal team communication. This is a private channel since VFS work is often discussed.
- **#vsp-collaboration-cycle** This is the main channel for the Collaboration Cycle. All reviewers and OCTO practice area leads involved in the Collaboration Cycle are included. This is a private channel since VFS work is discussed.
- **#vfs-platform-support** This is the support channel that VFS teams use to request any support from Platform, including Collaboration Cycle reviews.
-  
Group:
**@vsp-product-support-members** This is our teams Slack group. When we receive requests in #vfs-platform-support, the group is tagged. All team members, including our PO, are included in the group.

#### GitHub
GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.

#### General things
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub. That should be full of groomed tickets in priority order.



#### Grey areas
Are we just providing guidance (sounds more like guardrails) for VFS teams or kind of policing and becoming roadblocks to launch?
