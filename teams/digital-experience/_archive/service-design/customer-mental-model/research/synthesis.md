# Platform Card Sort Synthesis

## Takeaways

1. Cards with “enforcement” in the name tended to be grouped together, as opposed to being grouped in with their corresponding practice area.
1. Though the concept of “Monitoring and Performance” came up 5 times as a category, there was a significant amount of discrepancy between what respondents placed in such a category.
1. There were 4 categories that came up for 5 or more respondents, with a common set of cards in them (see [Platform Cart Sort readout](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HwlXwykiBJ2XC7zXlp9YsBr39WsXT4USr88v46nYv7w/edit#slide=id.g94451db3d0_0_25) for details)
1. The category labels provided some great some hints at the type of language we can do further research to explore using: like Users & Security instead of Identity, or like Standards, or Governance instead of Enforcement

## Additional takeaways
- Would be interesting to apply Good Services framework to the themes/categories
- How applicable would this really be for documentation, esp since it isn't based on Eng or Designer mental model?
- Everything today feels like it's following the VSP mental model, and not necessarily the customer
- We almost always think about things in terms of practice area, but those were not used really as categories in the card sort
- If this is a good Product Manager mental model of the platform
- This is like a mental model of how other ppl would describe how our products ar organized, but not necessarily a path throgh all of this, or the most efficient path to take. We need those other slices. "I'm a BE eng, and I'm trying to  build a thing, how do I know what I need to do along the way?"
- Designers have a list of things they need to do when designing, so as they go forth this probably wouldn't be helpful for them.
- Might there be some error if the ppl who took it weren't 100% of what all the technical categories were?
- Do we want to be seen as enforcement or gate keepers? Or as a nice collab team? A little of both (National Park Service metaphor)


## Ways we might use this information in Platform initiatives
- Internal communications
  - VSP communications, making sure we hit these themes regularly, or cycling through the themes.
  - There's a theme from retros that VSP folks don't feel recognized in the ongoing work we do). Like, we did the mobile month experiment. Maybe these themes could guide internal focuses, like we want to promote good work in this category, we want to see more demos from it,etc. Could make it a comms priority. LIke right now we have comms process and tools (newsletter, slack) but what if we consciously as comms strategy decide to cycle through our tools for 4 months and regulary post "did you know" type stuff. Each month try and educate ppl about a new category.
- Slack automation
  - Slackbot for example for staged vs phased
  - Could a bot help look for terms and remind ppl of the correct term
  - or "it looks like you're asking about testing tools. are you? if so, here's a section of docs about it"
  - Using these as keywords to which a bot could respond w/a canned response. point of contact, or links to docs in that category
- Categories in the newsletter, almost like the sections of a newspaper
- Could we work it into VSP documentation guidelines that Gretchen has already developed (normalizing a taxonomy at scale to be a point of reference for all teams to use in any comms things they might do)
  - So you're going to talk about the Platform? Here's a doc to help w/labeling choices, how to orient what the topic is in the larger context of the platform
- Roadshow deck about what we do
- Internal VSP onboarding deck about what we do
- VFS onboarding deck about what Platform does
- Team doc/deck/collateral that's like "so you're gonna talk about Platform and explain what we do. Here's how."
- Point of contact list organized by theme. "Who to talk to about x"
- Documentation workflow, like if you're writing a doc about this thing, what's the process for knowing you  have approval from appropriate ppl to get the doc into the wild. Point of contact for these themes for the purposes of publishing docs.
- RACI as leadership team against these columns/themes/categories
- Team Charters (in the section about what Platform products teams are responsible for)
- VSP Products folder in the documentation site, instead of one flat list
- Targeting specific groups like designers, engineers, product people
  - Some of the categories align w/discipline (like analytics), could we target comms to certain ppl who'd need to know that info.
  - Like we have new standards for Identity, the people who are doing those jobs might need to know about info being updated and might need orientation

## Thoughts around a pilot and next steps

Next steps
- What labels/terms are meaningfulness of categorization labels and names of products
- What are our products/services? Like is review instances a standalone product? What do we call it?
- Cross check w/word list and get to standard set of terms
- Definition for the bounds of what we call a Platform product or service
  - For example: IA Strategy, is something like that too granular? Or should it just be IA?
  - Want it to be broad enough to encompass other things w/o expanding infinitely
- 

Desired behaviors once we have this established
- Take a look at relative level of maturity for the products/services and decide if we want to put more effort into maturing
- Revisit charters
