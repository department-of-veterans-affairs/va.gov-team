## Goal
Understand our stakeholder's mental model of our service offering.

## Desired outcomes
- Structure and format external communications with customers (roadmaps, docs, newsletters) in a way that makes the most sense
- Better track and prioritize customer enhancement requests

## Audience
- VFS product managers
- DEPO members

## Test Design
- Hybrid card sort w/one pre-populated category for "I don't know what this is"
- Temporary public Slack channel for more qualitative understanding about what language doesn't make sense, and what things we might be missing from the list

# Research Plan for Service Design, Customer Mental Model, August 2020

## Goals	
**1. What product & team are you doing this research for?** for the platform product and team overall, ideally to inform things like our external-facing roadmap, newsletter, documentation site, and other external-facing communications.

**2. Background:** we don't have a common way to name or categorize our platform offerings today. We have some scrapy external communications, like a newsletter, and documentation in github, and we do have a word list to start to get to a canonical place wrt terminology, but there's no common categorization or model for what our platform offers across all of our communications. 

**3. Research questions:**
  - What is our customer's mental model around the services we offer them?
  - Where does our language for our offering not make sense?
  - What features/services are we missing?

**4. Hypothesis:** if we know the customer's mental model of our service offering, we can more clearly and consistently help them navigate through this platform world by applying that IA/taxonomy/language/categorization across our communications and documentation.

## Method	
**1.	What method of research are you planning?** Remote unmoderated hybrid card sort w/one pre-populated category for "I don't know what this is," and a temporary public Slack channel for ppl to communicate what features/services are missing from the list and/or ask questions.

**2.	Why this method?** x 	

**3.	Where are you planning to do your research?** announcing and sharing the Optimal Workshop link at Team of Teams, at a DEPO meeting, and in the appropriate Slack channels.

**4.	What will you be testing?** the scrappy/draft list of platform features we have been putting together the past few months

## When? 	
**1.	Timeline:** Launch the card sort by 8/17 and keep it open until we have 20 responses
