Feedback from Content & IA and from VFS teams regarding our onboarding of VFS teams onto Platform

## 9/23/19

**IA onboarding for VAOS** — Internal notes from Megan

- Ending is still awkward, we should have Mikki have that slide up on her computer for Qs
- Need slide in between "tell us about your project" and wrap up. Need to change Andrea's name. (CHANGES MADE 9/23)

**IA onboarding for By Light** — Internal notes from Megan

- Intros went faster after separating personal and project intros into 2 slides
- Summary/wrap up/more Qs at end?
- Would be great to have a way to capture feedback from the VFS teams we are onboarding, but likely not worth it for the only IA ones as we won't be doing these moving forward

## 9/18/19

**IA onboarding for Global UX** — Internal notes from Megan

- Should "introduce yourselves" and "tell us about your project" be 2 separate slides?
- Intros took nearly 15 minutes of 30 minute onboarding. How to cut back on intros?


## 9/17/19

**Joint Content & IA onboarding for eBenefits** - Internal notes from Megan

- Have the VFS team introduce themselves in initial intro (fix my part) - add slide here?
- Should Megan do initial "tell us about your project" part as part of intro?
- Ask for their team Slack channel
- Does Mikki want to add info about her turnaround time (edit: no, or at least not yet until we better define the scope/type of this support work)
