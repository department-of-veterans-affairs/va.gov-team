# Documentation Guide

## Problem Statement
The documentation for VA.gov is spread out and difficult to navigate. As a Veteran Facing Services *(VFS)* creator, I need to be able to access the appropriate infomation for building and updating the VA.gov Platform without support from the current VA.gov contract team.

## VFS Documentation User Groups
1. Developers - Frontend, Backend, Devops
1. Designers and Researchers
1. Product People
1. Content Writers
1. Analytics Specialists
1. QA Specialists
1. IA Specialists

## Goals
### User Goals
As an new VFS creator, I can onboard to work on the VFS platform, navigate to the appropriate resources and successfully build/maintain products on the VFS platform.

**Can I run the VFS platform with *no guidance* from the current VA.gov contract team?**

### Business Goals - *Objectives*
1. Documentation is in place to help new VFS creators onboard into the tools and systems that apply to the work in their unique practice areas
1. Documentation is available and easily accessible for new VFS creators to monitor and maintain the existing tools on the VFS Platform
1. Processes and documentation are in place to guide new VFS creators to build and launch new systems on the VFS platform

## Assumptions
- VFS creators have the appropriate knowledge/skillsets to work with the tools for building on the VFS platform
- There will come a time when VFS creators will need to onboard without any ability to communitcate with the current team

## Value Propositions
Giving new VFS creators an easy way to navigate the resources needed to onboard and contribute to the VFS platform by creating a documentation guide / table of contents that links to the appropriate resources by practice area and by product.

## Solution Approach
**Step 1:** 
- Talk with each of the team to ensure we have a full list of systems/features they use to build stuff

**Step 2**
- Figuring out the user groups for the documentation

**Step 3**
- Aggregate all the various sources of documentation (Github Repos, design.va.gov, etc.)

**Step 4**
- Update & Delete information that is outdated or no longer useful (dead links, updating names/owners, etc.)

**Step 5**
- Create a table of contents for navigating the documentation for the various user groups

**Step 6**
- Research/test the documentation guide on new VFS creators to identify gaps and points of confusion

**Step 7**
- Refine the documentation guide based on user research

## Success Metrics
### Target Outcomes
- A new VFS creator can onboard and build without any help
- Limit the number of questions received that can't be answered with Docs

# Implementation Info
## Status
2/21/19 - Question we're trying to answer - *"Could a non Ad Hoc person run this?"*

#### Technical Documentation Approach
1. Write a very simple outline of what kind of docs would be useful for a developer. We generally see that as three categories:
   - Getting started/environment set up info
   - Higher level architecture information
   - In depth documentation on specific parts of the system
2. Once we have those categories, then start writing out a detailed outline to roughly identify how many topics are in each section and then break things apart if one of those categories seems too big. For the FE stuff, we ended up making a top level Forms category, instead of shoving all that in the in depth docs category.
3. Then created a list of all the current relevant documentation and take that list and put each item into the outline at the relevant spot, to give us even more info about where the documentation content would live.
4. Spend a little more time refining and thinking about what order developers might encounter the code and reorder appropriately.

## Notes from initial discussion with Patrick, Leah & Rachael 2/21/19 
1. Talk with each of the team to ensure we have a full list of systems/features they use to build stuff
2. Figuring out the user groups for the documentation
3. Sources of documentation (Github Repos, design.va.gov, etc.)
4. Discovery on modular Holistic view of IA for documentation across the board
   - How can we put together an approach for documentation that keeps docs close to code, is open and serves the needs of the various groups.(Mikki for recommendations on activities to do)


 Could a non Ad Hoc person run this?

Getting perspective from the teams on what they consider the things that people use to build tools. To add to list in  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QLx2hZBFjxxtQHcCJPpZpo8j5NgHSqt_joGxXjdV2Y8/edit#gid=0 column D.
