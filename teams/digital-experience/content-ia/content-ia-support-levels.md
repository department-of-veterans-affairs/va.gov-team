## VSP Content & IA Levels of Support

_Proposed by VSP Content & IA team October 2019. The purpose of this document is to better define the boundaries between VSP vs VFS content and information architecture work. This proposal is subject to change as all teams evolve; it is not comprehensive, but is instead based on requests that we have received since the inception of the platform._
