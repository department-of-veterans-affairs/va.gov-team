### Possible solution for auto saving a form in progress

1. No visual indication. Saving in the background automatically.
2. Everytime the cursor moves into a different field triggers the "â€¦saving" and "saved" indicator next to the field being saved.

3. Saving every X seconds. Showing visual indicator next to the chapter name and the continue button. Reason for showing at two places is to accomodate a longer page. It is likely the chapter name will be scrolled out of view as users move to work on fields at the lower part of the page.
