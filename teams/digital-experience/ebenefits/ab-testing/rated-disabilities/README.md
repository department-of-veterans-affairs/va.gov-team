# Overview
This is the test folder for the Rated Disabilites app on VA.gov. The Rated Disabilites app is a simple app where a Veteran can view the disabilites they currently have listed with the VA as well as what their total disability rating is. This disability rating is used by the VA to deternime what disability benefits the Veteran is to recieve.

# The problem this app solves
Often times Veterans need to know what disabilites they have listed with the VA so that they know what disabilites the VA has approved for them as well as how that afects the benefits they recieve. Since many Veterans rely on disability benefits for much or all of their income this is very important app for Veterans.
