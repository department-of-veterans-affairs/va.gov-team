# Key Principles for Transforming Large Forms
`eBenefits | June 2020`  

## What have we learned about implementing or transforming large forms into an improved digital experience?  
What would we do different?

### General Notes
- Leveraging known information about the user early; pre-fill as much as possible
- Talking to the stakeholder about the form itself; is it created with field names correctly? what is the ultimate objective?
- Learning about the submission process early
- Learning what is actually required; how can we make the form smaller?
- Does the form have any natural "splits" that would allow for it change shape depending on how certain questions are answered?
- Maintaining communication about where the user is in the form, as well as progress is important
- Checkboxes, dropdowns, datepickers, anything pre-filled and single-clickable is welcomed
