# eBenefits Moderated Research - P2

Friday, October 4, 2019 at 2pm ET

## Intro - 5 minutes

**Moderator:** Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about VA benefits. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 to 50 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

**Veteran:** Yes, that's fine.

**Moderator: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*[Starts recording.]*

- **Moderator: I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?" 

**Veteran:** Yes.

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

**Moderator:** Before we talk about the website, tell me about yourself.  

**Veteran:** How much do you want to know? 

**Moderator:** Where did you serve, how long? Your hobbies?

**Veteran:** Are you sure this isn't a dating website? No [_laughs_]. US Marine corps active duty, Navy reserves for 6 years. I currently work for the VA Pittsburgh. Been a VA employee for the last 10+ years, have done a little of everything. Computer background, business background, a little bit of everything.

**Moderator:** What did you do in the computer industry?

**Veteran:** Um... Well when we learned Cobalt, that was back in the 90s. When I got out of school, I got a job with the Marriott and it was almost useless to go with computers but it got me doing other things. I've always been technically savvy compared to other people.

**Moderator:** Well I'm really interested to hear your feedback on VA! We are going to be talking about VA benefits today. Just so you know, you don't have to talk about specifics dealing with your personal health if you don't feel comfortable. 

## Navigation: 

**Moderator:** Are you familiar with VA.gov?

**Veteran:** Yes. 

**Moderator:** Are you familiar with the eBenefits website?

**Veteran:** Correct. 

**Moderator:** Tell me abut your experience using eBenefits.

**Veteran:** The biggest thing I can say about the system is that it sucks when it wants you to keep changing your password and do all types of weird stuff to come up with the password. I do understand the whole part of being secured and I'm sure some peole would acutally just put down Password1 as their password but some of this stuff is ridiculous. Is it every 3 months you guys force us to change it?

**Moderator:** I'm not sure, but that sounds about right.

**Veteran:** That is just too much. I've talked to some older Vets and it's just too much. They would probably be more willing to participate in MHV if it was more streamlined. I know this isn't what you were asking but if all the progammers out there could come up with a system or a program that streamlined per age demographically... so as people were getting a little older, it's a little easer for them to log into the system for the first time if they don't have anyone that's younger to help them out.

I've talked to some of these guys who are in their 50s, 60s, 70s, I ask them if they go into eBenefits and they're like, "I don't do that crap."

**Moderator:** That does sound frustrating. For you, what has your experience been like once you do get logged in?

**Veteran:** There are certain things that there are... It's not... I tried to upload a file multiple times and it would not upload into eBenefits. I have a disabled son that is permanently disabled. And I've been... He's 20 now, and over 2 years and he is still not added into my system as a dependent. Every time it says I uploaded it, I go back later and it's gone.

**Moderator:** What part of the website was that for? I'm going to share my screen -- this is a test account we are looking at.

[_Moderator shares screen_]

**Veteran:** Add dependent child, permanently disabled. I couldn't do it from my home computer so I scanned it at work into a PDF. It took it through a government computer, but then it still disappeared.

**Moderator:** I'm really sorry that happened. What else do you do on eBenefits? Is there anything that has worked well?

**Veteran:** The ability to get in there and look at missed appointments bcause you can schedule stuff and pull all your information. We are very fragmented with computer systems and they are trying to make a... What's the word I'm looking for. I'm using VA terms and that's not what you guys use. A lot of the systems are legacy viewer systems that don't talk to each other. It seems to be a little bit of an issue. I do remember going into something because... you go to the one screen, I can't remember where it's at. All the sites you can open since you go through eBenefits. I haven't done this for about a month.

Champis... That came up, I don't think I qualify. Why would it tell me to log in? It kinda wasted my time. Why would it be something I could log into if I'm not eligible for it? Is there a yes/no decision making system that can help you go through the whole process that you can click on and it asks if you are retired, are you active duty, and it tells you you are not eligible. It would be a little quicker going through that than 5 minutes of wasting my time.

**Moderator:** How often do you go to eBenefits?

**Veteran:** It's intermittent, I go on sometimes every 2 weeks but sometimes I'm too busy to get on it or don't need to get on it for a month. Being an adult, you have work and family. I have to throw in my college classes and that throws me off for everything.

**Moderator:** Why do you use eBenefits? What are your goals when you go there?

**Veteran:** There's a lot of good stuff in there. It's somewhat user friendly at times. I know on military sites, it says, "I know you're looking for this." Like "Oh I want a letter" go on frickin eBenefits.

[_Gets interrupted by someone at work_]

**Moderator:** You were mentioning the main things you would use eBenefits for.

**Veteran:** Yeah, I try and explain to people how there are things they can do... I might talk to someone, a Marine Corps Veteran who may be eligible for Camp Lejeune [_? didn't catch the word he said next_]. And say, get on eBenefits, and they say, "I've never heard of it."

Well, just because things happen and things can change. Usually I will run through my profile and make sure my personal information and dependents are all accurate and no one has gone in and done something they haven't done, somebody dyslexic hasn't gone in and changed a number so my money is going to someone else. 

Yes, and I go to the dependents page. If I have time I go through all of it to make sure nothing has changed.

**Moderator:** Oh ok so kind of maintaining your account?

**Veteran:** Mm hmm. 

**Moderator:** Has it ever redirected to VA.gov?

**Veteran:** Yeah it does that for MyHealtheVet. It's interesting because they try to shove way too much info on the home page. They could probably make it multiple but there are probably people that say I want it all! What are benefits for me are probably different from someone else.

**Moderator:** What would be a benefit to you?

**Veteran:** Um... [_pauses_] There is... I'm trying to remember... What is everyone always asking? They are trying to get a copy of their DD-214. I thought there was some way to do it but I can't think of how to do that here.

Claims process always seems to be a little skewed a little bit because I had the one claim, I gotta go back and look because I don't think it changed everything to have my son back as my dependent. You go back and it says work in progress... Ok it's a finished thing... If you click on something, it comes up and says, "Do you want to finish this claim?" I didn't put in for a claim, I was just looking for information.

**Moderator:** Okay, so kinda confusing content?

**Veteran:** Yes.

[_Moderator navigates back to the profile page_]

**Moderator:** How do you normally get to eBenefits?

**Veteran:** It depends. I try to take my website that I use and create a document and put all the shortcuts on it and group them so I can be more... the productivity level is a little higher. So if I go to another computer, I go to my email. You don't always have a floating profile. Some of these systems, you can log into Google and if you log into another place your shortcuts will come but that doesn't always happen. There are different things - I have a document already saved with that information, or it's bookmarked.

**Moderator:** You mentioned shortcuts - do you save the eBenefits url? Or a specific page?

**Veteran:** Little bit of both. Trying to remember how your system does it.

## Features: - 10 minutes

**Moderator:** Have you had a disability rating done?

**Veteran:** [_sighs_] Yes, it has been.

**Moderator:** Have you ever looked up your disability rating, or pending ratings, on eBenefits? If so, why?

**Veteran:** Um... Yes and no. I know what it is. It's not going to change. That whole process is kind of a funky system because I don't understand how they do that. I fell off of a jet and screwed up my elbow, traumatic shock and all that stuff. My left side is kind of funky. When you go to your disability thing, it says, "It's just your elbow." I learned in elementary school that this bone is connected to this bone. It's a different argument.

The first time I made a claim it was through my VSO, through the Legion. I updated it and added additional claims to my rating. Instead of going through my VSO I was able to do it through eBenefits. My last upgrade is through the information I put in eBeneftis. I was trying to add my dependents in for my disabilities and that doesn't work.

**Moderator:** When you went through eBenefits did you do it through this page? [_Disabilities page_]

**Veteran:** Yes. I can't remember what was a little hard - it may have changed because this was a few years ago. My son.. his disbiliity, I had to make a phone call and had whoever email me the VA form that needed to get filled out. It wasn't something I was able to find on the website. The DBQs and all those forms, is it under my documents? Do you have a section under here that says forms that may be needed you can just click on and populate the data in a fillable PDF?

**Moderator:** Is that something that would be helpful?

**Veteran:** I think it would be, especially if it can extrapolate the data from the computer system and fill out it out that would be awesome.

**Moderator:** You mentioned having trouble getting your son added. You got all the way through the process and said there was a file missing?

**Veteran:** I made a phone call to get the form to add a dependent that is permanently disabled. He has [PHI], and he is never going to have a normal life. He will always be permanently disabled. There is a form that gets filled out by his PCP and you're supposed to upload it into the system and the 3-4 times I tried to do that, it would never accept it.

**Moderator:** I'm sorry that's happening to you! 

[_Pause_]

**Moderator:** Have you ever had to order any medical equipment?

**Veteran:** No - secure messaging is through MyHealtheVet, I do everything through that. Or since I work at the VA I can just walk into a clinic and say that I need this ordered. You can't beat that.

**Moderator:** Do you use any other websites besides MHV or VA.gov to manage your care?

**Veteran:** I don't think there are any, are there?

**Moderator:** I am not sure. We just wanted to make sure we are covering all our bases and ask.

**Veteran:** There are a few times you may need to go... not OPM. What is the site? GovernmentPubsForm.com? Or government publications and forms? There are a few times when I couldn't find the one, I tried to search it through the publications and forms and fillable PDFs, so I ended up making the phone call. If there was a way in your dashboard to put down a link for forms, fillable forms. And you click on it and you may need this, you may need that. I don't remember if there is a hyperlink when you submit a new claim. That may not be a bad thing too, a hyperlink embedded in the form that says, "Oh you need to fill out this form," and you think, "Oh it's blue, I need to open that up!"

**Moderator:** How do you use these other sections? [_Scrolls over other navigation items_]

**Veteran:** NRD I've looked through a few times, a few sites that were interesting. Employment Center... I usually go to usajobs. What is that? Click on it?

[Moderator clicks the Employment Center link and the VA careers and employment page loads]

**Veteran:** The VA for Vets... I never really saw that being feasible. Most of this stuff is useful. I'm just going all over the place. Beacuse I'm over 30% disabled, I'm going through Voc Rehab to go to school. That data in that is kind of... you need to learn a little more about things than you do. Because when I first went through, I was told I can't accept another job until I finish my degree because I would lose all my benefits but then I found out that if I don't take a job that's not in my educational plan I can take any job I want. That would've been nice to know earlier.

I tell people my biggest phrase at the VA is that we learn more by accident than on purpose. It is such a large system that has grown expontentially and there is so much data and you don't know what you need. Sometimes I come across something online and decide to bookmark it and it ends up being something useful that might be a legacy thing from a different program. I might be more computer literate than other people though and it might be easier for me.

On Facebook, they all complain about the same thing: How do I get a copy of my DD214? Can I get this? Can I get that? You would think there is a FAQ that Veterans can just click on but are they just being lazy? I'm sure you have Facebook and other social media sites. And people type in, "where is a good place for chicken?" and I'm thinking you could type that into your browser and about 50 different shops would come up. It seems kind of stupid at times.

**Moderator:** It seems like there is a need for some information to be surfaced based on your rating and what access you can get?

**Veteran:** Yeah here is an example. At the VA we have these old ID cards. The ID cards should've been changed 12-13 years ago, because I remember getting my letter that long ago if not longer. Around 2004-2005, I came up and got my new ID. I just saw a guy yesterday and said, "You know you've got the old ID. If you lose that ID, someone can scan it and with the old technology get your personal information: Social Security number, date of birth, for identify theft." 

If people don't know what they need to know, they listen to people who don't know what they are talking about but they don't know and that's frustrating. I don't know how hard would it be... people would think it would be a scam. You send me an email and I post it on the Marine Corps Facebook page. "Send me one email about something that you want to improve," they would all have the same questions: How can I get my DD-214? What am I elgiible for? Can I get the PX? If you took 3 minutes to look... you might find out but you just ask instead.

**Moderator:** What things do you wish you had known, or have you stumbled upon and found? You mentioned some forms earlier, you mentioned ordering equipment... are there other things that aren't here on the website that would be helpful to have on the eBenefits website?

**Veteran:** I don't know how feasible... If there is a way to put in a link that says, I have a 20% disability. And you can click on that and it lists.. at 20% you are eligible for all of this and possibly more. At 30%, you get all this and by the way you don't have to pay copays and you get travel pay. If there was a away to make it easier for everyone to understand.

## Post-Interview - 5 minutes

**Moderator:**  What is your favorite part about using eBenefits?

**Veteran:** The good thing about is that if I'm applying for a governemnet job, I can just go to documents and if I want to generate a new letter for... what's it called? Preference! Employment preference. Being a disabled Vet you get preference over other people. If you want a job at VA you gotta go get this form. Well what form? The documents seem to be more useful than other things.

**Moderator:** Why is that?

**Veteran:** Because it's stuff that you can get to quicker and you can generate it. There is supposed to be somewhere on eBenefits that I can ask for my DD-214. Documents - is that documents that the person has submitted or ones that you can get? I don't remember. They are associated with a claim, you know if they want to get the DD-214 can you get it printed out? Or do you have to wait for it to be mailed? Sometimes it like, "Oh god I didn't realize I had to get my DD-214 to get my disabliity sticker and it takes a few weeks."

**Moderator:** That makes sense. Is there anything I should know but didn't ask about? 

**Veteran:** Not that I can think of.

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

**Veteran:** I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to talk! [_Laughs_] And all these anonymous observers. [_Laughs_]

[_Wrap up_]
