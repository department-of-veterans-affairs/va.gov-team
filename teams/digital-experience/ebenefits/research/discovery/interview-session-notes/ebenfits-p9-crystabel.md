# eBenefits Moderated Research - P9


Tuesday, October 8 3pm EST

## **Warm up questions**:

**Moderator**: Will you tell me about yourself and briefly about your services?

**Veteran**: Son of a retired marine, he showed the way of service. I joined a couple years after he retired. Joined marine boot camp, became the rank of corporal in Quantico, Virginia. Commissioned to second lieutenant in 1985. Served a variety of posts and stations which is normal for a marine. Spent a tour of combat in Iraq in 2005. Retained the rank colonel and retired 2007. Again mostly tours and posted stations worldwide. Marine sent me to 21 countries. Not overnight stays but tours of duties and exercise. I was in the Pentagon on 9/11


## **Navigation**:

**Moderator**: Can you tell me what your experience has been like with VA benefits?

**Veteran**: VA benefits has been mixed. Didn’t have any issues. They funded a masters degree for me. Relates to disability. I’ve had no issues receiving benefits those were provided direct deposit. Those are really the only VA benefits I’ve used. I attempted some medical.

**Moderator**: Can you tell me more specifically how you use the eBenefits website?

**Veteran**: I think it’s well-designed and runs smoothly. I think my original sessions were like this. 
Years ago, I was asked to look at small measure of design with the website and I think y’all have done a great job with it.

**Moderator**: What specific things are you using on the eBenefits website?

**Veteran**: Predominantly entering and asking disability ratings and document uploads and reviews and obviously some appeal processes.

**Moderator**: When you navigate to the eBenefits website, do you bookmark it or do you type it in?

**Veteran**: I have a document on my computer that has my passwords. I hyperlink the URL into that document. I normally click on the hyperlink that takes me to the URL

**Moderator**: Are there specific URL pages saved in eBenefits?

**Veteran**: No, just the title page.

**Moderator**: Have you noticed a time where you've been redirected from eBenefits to va.gov or vice versa?

**Veteran**: There has been a couple times, I'd have to get on and look through those occasions more specifically.

**Moderator**: Can you describe the transition? Frustrated? Easy? What was your general feeling?

**Veteran**: I don't remember any irritants or anything troublesome. On eBenefits, is that the website I’d get the VA identification card? 

*[Moderator shares screen]*

**Moderator**: So you said this is where you got your veteran ID?

**Veteran**: So the choose VA veteran identification card, would I have gone through eBenefits? I'm pretty sure I would have. I couldn't imagine why I would not have. As it relates to the identification card, there are a couple of gripes but that relates to that portion of the website. If I had a wrong, that would be it. It was frustrating, it kept taking you to screen that wasn't working or would time out. Again, this would have been a year and a half ago now. Then it took forever to get the card, but that’s a different unrelated issue. As far as the screen you're showing me now. It’s intuitive the links would work, no major issues with latency. I can't say that I used every hotlink under the left dashboard. I don't care about account activity I don’t think I’ve ever used. Didn’t have to do any major things in that regard.

**Moderator**: When looking at this page, what are some of the main things you're doing with eBenefits?

**Veteran**: Working on claims and appeals. I have a series of issues that's not related to the website but how the VA works and approaches certain issues. On this website I could do without many major issues

**Moderator**: What would you say are the main differences between eBenefits and va.gov website?

**Veteran**: Are they both designed by the same web verb? I don’t know any linkage between what you all do on this particular site. Writing the code or laying it out. I think the main thing, forgive me if I have this wrong, if I go to multiple websites for the same organization. I tend to like the sites to look the same. I don’t like seeing a site get designed by someone else. An hour from now, I know I’ll be saying oh shoot, I wish I told her that. If I look at a particular screen and I see certain links, I’d like to see consistency mostly. Once you have a feel for the web page, you wanna go to certain areas. If I want to search I click right, if I want to go home I click left, any info not on the screen itself I go to the bottom to see employee resources 
 
**Moderator**: What devices do u use to access VA websites? 

**Veteran**: Desktop computer at work or VA service center. When I had my desktop at home, I lost in a storm last year, I don’t use a tablet or phone, but I’m sure there’s an app. 

*lost info here*

From a health perspective, I use local medical entities around here used whether for my dependents or whether i get champused out. Now that I'm Tricare prime, I go to military service they provide me a place out of town requires more scheduling. Medical there’s 5-6 others I have used

**Moderator**: You mentioned dependents, do you have dependents for benefits?

**Veteran**: My wife and daughter

**Moderator**: Do you use eBenefits for that?

**Veteran**: Just to add information, but no nothing I had to do for them that I can recall.

## **Features**:
 
**Moderator**: Have you had a disability rating done?

**Veteran**: Yes

**Moderator**: Have you had to look up rating on eBenefits? How often have you done that?

**Veteran**: Not on routine basis. Last year probably a few more times than the norm
Believe it or not, some I’m seeing on the screen is what I’m chasing after. It’s episodic for those that went through the process and had a favorable outcome. You wouldn't come back unless checking if it hit the proces. Going in for the appeal process there are more times 

**Moderator**: I'm assuming you’d be checking the pending section then

**Veteran**: VA is good at notifying you by letter. I don’t know if I think for right now most of the service connected decisions that I got. I don't know what I say see the pending claim very often. There you got it and you certainly can't expect an answer overnight. I expect a couple more important ones as you will. Yeah I might end up checking it a few times. I expect if I had this 2008 it would have been a lot better. I don't recall this website being easy to navigate the system so you did everything by letter. So i can see major improvements than what I see in 2007. 

**Moderator**: Have you ever had to order any medical equipment?
Veteran: I probably should have but I did not. I wind up attempting to find it locally. Just a proximity to military treatment facility. There’s one that I found  as an alternative that worked just as well

**Moderator**: That’s all the questions that I have for this website. Any questions I should have asked?

**Veteran**: Last login shows up there, some people might find that important, for me it doesn’t tell me anything. I'm assuming it shows last login for me. If the issue is to show, privacy or there has been a stolen identity then it may need to reflect that differently.

**Moderator**: Do you use any of these links on top of the page?

**Veteran**: A couple like learn or directory. I would say..I got the national pass for national park service, but didn’t go through VA. It went through another organization. I went through directory. For example, those with a permanent disability, can get a free pass to national parks run by the federal government. It’s weird how you get it though, I can't remember the agency you get it through. You get it though office personnel management or something.

**Moderator**: Have you visited any of the parks yet?

**Veteran**: I visit the smoky mountains every year or the outer banks. Didn’t go this year because of the storm 

## **Post-Interview questions**

**Moderator**: What would you say is the least favorite part of eBenefits?

**Veteran**: Not getting the answers I want. Haha. An honest question, I don’t think there is anything I’m unhappy about. Again, it’s intuitive, laid out in a nice manner, I tend to like the word congruent, meaning not necessarily consistency but likeness or similarity. If I find an action button in particular area on the screen. I don't have to hunt around. I find no signs for latency or 411 errors, another website gives me all the time. It just seems to be glitchy in a technical sense. I have not noticed that with this website. Seems to work fairly well. I think the logging in pr
ocess is fairly easy. I think I can use my CAC card, to do it. Because trying to remember a 15 letter password is problematic. I really like department of treasury works there login process where you enter in your account and part of authentication process, it presents a keyboard with all the characters on it. You hot button on that keyboard. The keyboard changes how it’s brought up. Gives a photo you picked part of authentication process.

**Moderator**: What’s your favorite part of eBenefits?

**Veteran**: Good answers I get. If you do it right, you're probably not gonna hear about it. The expectation level is so high, I remember having to dial in the internet, seconds is incredible to me. I don't worry too much about how things appear to me. I won't tell you I don't like the color mauve and prefer the color purple I want to get what I need and leave. If I can get what I can and leave, then that’s success.
