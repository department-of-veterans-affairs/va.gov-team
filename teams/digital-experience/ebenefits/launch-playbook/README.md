# Launch Playbook
This will be where we will house documents that will lay the foundation for launching new products or features from within eBenefits to VA.gov.  
See [Checklist.md](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/452daf2b84b47994f7bd85d136fed30b31b9dbbe/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits/launch-playbook/checklist.md) for a list of things to check before launch or as devleopment progresses.  
See [Tickets.md](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits/launch-playbook/tickets.md) for a list of commonly created tickets.  

_Both are WIP and if you have any suggestions, please contact Jason Wolf (@Jason in Slack)_
