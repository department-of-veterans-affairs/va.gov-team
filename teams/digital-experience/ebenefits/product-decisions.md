# The Problem
We need to build a lot of stuff for Veterans and we need it to all be at a very high quality. To have the biggest impact we can as a team we also need to build things quickly. Our goal going forward is to achieve a pace of work that is both sustainable and is optimized for feature delivery quality and speed.

# The solution

Building software is hard, it required multiple disciplines working in concert. Each of the contributors involved comes to the project with their skills, their own experiences, and most importantly their expectations. We have decided to come to a few agreements as a team to manage expectations and make sure everyone is on the same page -

`Agreement 1` - Each discipline is not to focus on more than two features inside a single sprint. This is meant to make sure that we can 1. deliver the best quality experiences for Veterans. This is also so that we can 2. deliver at the highest speed we can without getting cognitively taxed too hard or burnt out.

`Agreement 2` - We are to spend as much time is needed per feature before moving on to a subsequent feature. We have a roadmap of what we will build in the upcoming future and the temptation is to start on all of it now. We have decided not to start on all of it now and to instead start on what is right in front of us and work on that until we either need to ship something OR we hit a complete blocker for the entire team. Some members of the team may hit blockers from time to time but this doesn't mean other disciplines should take their focus off the feature as well and further scatter our team's resources.
