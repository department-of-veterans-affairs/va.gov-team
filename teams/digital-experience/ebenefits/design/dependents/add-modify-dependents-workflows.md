# Add & Modify Dependents Baseline Functionality
Current functionality of Add & Modify Dependents is based on current implementation of Legacy eBenefits. 21-686c form implementation on VA.gov does not seem to include individual user paths or workflows; it presents an end-to-end Add Dependent process.

### Add & Modify Dependents Workflow

- Navigate to eBenefits website
- Click to log in (Home Screen)
- Enter Username and password (DS Login)
- View User Dashboard
- Navigate to Dependents (two links on-screen)
- More to follow...
