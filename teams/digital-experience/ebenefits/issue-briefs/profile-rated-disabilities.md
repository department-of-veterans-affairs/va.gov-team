Status	| Profile
Status Notes	| Migrate this feature to VA.gov user profile. This feature has not been migrated and is dependent on another feature (non-Veteran user type). In order for this to be *fully* completed, VA profile access needs to be expanded to additional user types. However, letting Veterans view their rated disabilities is not precluded by that requirement.
