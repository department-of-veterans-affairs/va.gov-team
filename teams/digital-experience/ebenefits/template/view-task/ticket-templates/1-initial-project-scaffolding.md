# { View Task Name } Initial Project Scaffolding

## Description

In order to get the initial folder and file structure set up for { View Task Name } we need to scaffold out the project in `vets-website`. This scaffolding will not include any of the custom functionality of the { View Task Name } and all of the content in this scaffolding is heavily subject to change.

### Tasks

1. Either run Yeoman generator as non-form app OR manually build out initial folder structure
2. Add simple component structure to match the basic structure of the prototype as it currently stands
3. Add content as it stands in the prototype to the basic component structure

### Acceptance criteria

1. The initial folder and file struture for { View Task Name } has been created
2. The { View Task Name } page contains the page content as it currently stands in the mockup
3. A PR for this ticket has been submitted and is awaiting approval
