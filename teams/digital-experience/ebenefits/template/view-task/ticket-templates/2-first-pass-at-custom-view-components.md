# First pass at custom view components for { View Task Name }

## Decription

The { View Task Name } contains { Custom functionality } function and a basic implimentation of this needs to be added to the app. This initial implimentation only needs to largely be static as the actual { Custom functionality } action(s) will be added in a subsiquent ticket(s). This ticket is mostly for building the intial structure for how the custom functionality will be built on the code side but any logic or data can be omitted at this point.

### Tasks

1. Build out file and folder structure for { Custom functionality }
2. Build out initial component(s) for { Custom functionality } with no data and a static render
 

### Acceptance criteria

1. The initial component strucrture for { Custom functionality } has been built
2. a PR for this ticket has been created and is awaiting approval
