## Background
When we set up the form fields for the [Form Name] we added a schema into `vets-json-schema`. All schemas in `vets-json-schema` need to be unit tested to ensure they accept the correct data as well as reject incorrect data. We need to add unit tests for our schema.

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up test file
- [ ] Write unit tests for the [Form Name] application schema in `vets-json-schema`
- [ ] Submit a PR in `vets-json-schema` for review

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] The schema for [Form Name] in `vets-json-schema` has been unit tested to 80% coverage
- [ ] A PR has been submitted to `vets-json-schema` for review
