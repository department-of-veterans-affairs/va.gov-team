## Veteran Support Crew Charter 

### North Star 

Ensure Veteran problems are quickly addressed through a seamless experience that connects users to support tools and channels and collects data to drive improvements. 

We imagine a support experience that: 
- makes the VA support bureaucracy invisible to the Veteran by surfacing the relevant content, tools and support channels so Veterans can decide how they want to get help.
- quickly identifies recurring problems or pain points through feedback and data, and empowers teams to quickly solve them.
- proactively informs and collaborates with VA support stakeholders to ensure the best possible process for resolving VA.gov user issues.  

### Description 

The Veteran Support Crew leads the digital support experience on and for VA.gov and the VA Health and Benefits app. We bridge the gap between Veterans & VA staff by providing tools, information, and coordination to product teams, the helpdesks, and the end users.

### What we are working on 

VA.gov Digital Support Experience 
- [Ask VA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/products/ask-va-phase-1-product-outline.md): The Ask VA VA.gov team (not to be confused with the Ask VA CRM team led by VES) is currently working on moving the current front-end experience on [ask.va.gov](http://ask.va.gov/) to VA.gov. This includes making updates to the form and dashboard to align with VA.gov standards, and developing API endpoints to connect with AVA's back-end CRM.
- [Contact Us page research](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1719251794794/aa0db9f68c23d8d38f10e49f39cad9f67665c5f5?sender=u44efa807e992cacf10cf3697): We're working on conducting user research on VA.gov's current Contact us page to inform future updates to the page and overall digital support experience for Veterans. 

[VA.gov Digital Surveys](https://vfs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Contact/pages/1794015358/VA.gov+Digital+Surveys): In partnership with VSignals and using Medallia software, the Veteran Support Team creates digital surveys on VA.gov that enable VFS teams to collect feedback for their products directly from users as they use the site. 

[Veteran Technical Support](https://vfs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Contact/pages/1791983795/Tier+II+III+Support): This team is responsible for working closely with VA contact centers to train agents on how to handle VA.gov Tier 1 issues and receive escalated VA.gov Tier 2 and Tier 3 issues for investigation into specific systems or code managed by VA technical teams.
