Report: Desk Research for Redesigning the VA.gov A11y Intercept Survey
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose of the Report
The purpose of this report is to present the findings from desk research conducted to inform the redesign of the VA.gov A11y (Accessibility) intercept survey. This research aims to ensure that the redesigned survey is accessible, user-friendly, effective, and aligned with industry best practices.
1.2 Research Objectives
Identify best practices in intercept surveys used by federal government agencies and private organizations.
Assess accessibility compliance and ensure inclusivity for users with disabilities.
Benchmark against similar surveys in other agencies to identify competitive features.
Determine strategies to improve survey engagement and data quality.
Align the survey design with legal, ethical, and privacy standards.

2. Benchmarking Best Practices in Intercept Surveys
2.1 Federal Government Agencies with Intercept Surveys
The following federal agencies utilize intercept surveys for gathering user feedback:
Agency
Survey Purpose
Survey Characteristics
Peace Corps
Measures user satisfaction with website experience.
Online pop-up surveys, concise questions, collects Net Promoter Score (NPS).
General Services Administration (GSA)
Evaluates service delivery and user satisfaction.
Uses Qualtrics, contextual deployment, minimal disruption.
National Park Service (NPS)
Collects visitor feedback at park sites.
On-site surveys, short-response format, targeted approach.
Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)
Gather insights from special-interest populations.
Uses in-person intercept surveys, accessibility-focused.
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
Collects data from recreational anglers.
Conducted in-person, focused on specific user groups.
USA.gov
Evaluates overall user experience and task completion rates on the website.
Pop-up surveys triggered based on user interaction, concise format, and plain language questions.

2.2 Characteristics of Effective Intercept Surveys
Concise & Relevant: Short surveys (3-5 questions) with clear purpose.
Accessibility Compliant: Designed for users with disabilities (e.g., screen reader compatibility, high contrast, keyboard navigation).
Well-Timed Deployment: Appears at key user interactions to maximize engagement.
Minimal Intrusiveness: Ensures users can easily dismiss or complete the survey.
Actionable Insights: Provides clear, measurable feedback for decision-making.

3. Accessibility (A11y) Considerations
3.1 Ensuring WCAG Compliance
To meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1/2.2), the survey must:
Be compatible with screen readers (e.g., JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver).
Have proper color contrast (at least 4.5:1 for text).
Support keyboard-only navigation.
Provide alternative text for visual elements.
3.2 Inclusive Design for Veterans with Disabilities
Use Plain Language to ensure ease of comprehension.
Offer multiple response formats (e.g., text, voice, and large buttons for selection).
Provide an option to enlarge text for better readability.
Ensure error prevention and correction in form fields.

4. Competitive Benchmarking & Recommendations
4.1 Lessons from Competitor Intercept Surveys
GSA & Peace Corps: Use unobtrusive, well-integrated pop-up surveys.
NPS & BTS: Collect in-the-moment, targeted feedback from specific users.
NOAA: Uses tailored approaches for niche audiences (fishermen, park visitors).

4.2 Recommendations for VA.gov A11y Survey Redesign
Use a Modal Pop-Up Format: Consistent with VA.gov’s design patterns.
Optimize for Mobile & Desktop: Ensure responsiveness across all devices.
Limit Survey Length: include a progress bar and a max 1-2 questions per page to encourage participation.
Trigger at Key Moments: Deploy when users complete an action (e.g., submitting a form, navigating a new page, exiting).
Ensure Full Accessibility: Meet WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and provide multiple input options.

5. Legal, Ethical, and Privacy Considerations
5.1 Compliance with Federal Regulations
Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA): Ensure survey follows OMB guidelines.
Privacy Act of 1974: Protect user data and disclose usage transparently.
Section 508 Compliance: Adhere to federal accessibility laws.
5.2 Ethical Considerations
Clearly state voluntary participation.
Ensure anonymous response collection unless explicit consent is given.
Avoid leading questions to maintain neutrality.

6. Implementation Strategy
6.1 Next Steps
Prototype Development: Create wireframes for the new survey.
Usability Testing: Conduct A/B testing with veterans, including those with disabilities.
Pilot Launch: Deploy on a limited scale for real-world feedback.
Iteration & Optimization: Refine based on feedback and analytics.
Full Deployment: Roll out the improved intercept survey site-wide.
6.2 Metrics for Success
Completion Rate: Percentage of users who finish the survey.
Drop-Off Rate: Users who abandon the survey midway.
Response Quality: Number of actionable responses received.
Engagement Rate: Percentage of users interacting with the survey.

7. Conclusion
This desk research highlights the best practices, accessibility requirements, and competitive insights necessary to redesign the VA.gov A11y intercept survey effectively. By implementing these recommendations, VA.gov can ensure a more inclusive, user-friendly, and impactful feedback mechanism that aligns with industry standards and improves veteran experiences.
