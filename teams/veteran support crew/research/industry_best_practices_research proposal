Understanding Industry Best Practices for Contact Centers:

A Comprehensive Research Proposal


Executive Summary
Objective:

This research proposal aims to identify, analyze, and synthesize best practices within the contact center industry. By understanding these practices,the veteran support team will strive to enhance operational efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and drive innovation in our contact center operations.

Background:
As the number of users signing into VA.gov for health and other benefits services increases, there is a growing need to re-evaluate our approach to providing support. The current technical support system for VA.gov presents several key issues:

Sign-In Issues:
Signing in is the major driver of support issues on VA.gov. While some problems are caused by systems managed by VA, the majority are related to third-party credential providers. Each contact center aims to limit the number of misdirected issues coming to their helpdesk. Currently, there is no efficient process in place to ensure that Veterans receive the answers they need as quickly as possible.

Health-Related Tools and Support:
As health-related tools are integrated into VA.gov, there is uncertainty about which groups are responsible for supporting these tools. For instance, while HRC is responsible for My HealtheVet (MHV) support, it is unclear if they will also support MHV on VA.gov. Ensuring that Veterans are directed to the appropriate call center without frustration is critical.

Recurring User and System Issues:
We have identified many recurring user and system-generated issues (e.g., lost MFA methods, missing information error messages). Although we have documented these issues and created processes for the Veteran Support Team, VEO Tier 1 Contact Center, and EVSS helpdesk, more can be done to keep all support groups updated. This ensures that users can find the right answers regardless of where they seek support.

Tier 3 Support for Health and Benefits App:
HRC is responsible for supporting the Health and Benefits App but lacks a Tier 3 process for resolving these issues. There is a need to collaborate with other contact centers to route Tier 3 VA.gov technical issues to the Veteran Support Team effectively.
Given these challenges, we believe it is time to conduct research to better understand what an improved phone support experience would look like for VA.gov users and the support groups managing these issues. We aim to validate our assumptions through both internal and external research, enabling us to make informed changes to enhance the support experience for all stakeholders.  This inclusive approach encourages feedback and innovation while benchmarking against industry standards.

Problem Statement:
Our contact center operations currently face challenges in keeping up with shared training processes, rapid technological changes (i.e. errors , new products,etc), and optimizing operational efficiency. Our ability to improve and innovate is limited without a clear understanding of industry best practices and  each contact center's process.

Research Questions:
What are the current best practices in our VA contact centers VS.  industry?
How do leading contact centers implement these best practices?
What impact do these best practices have on operational efficiency and
customer satisfaction at VA contact centers ?
How can our contact centers integrate these practices to improve outcomes?

Methodology:

Literature review: Comprehensive review of academic articles, industry reports, and case studies related to contact center operations
Benchmarking: Comparative analysis of leading contact centers to identify successful strategies and practices
Surveys and interviews: Gathering insights from industry experts, contact center managers, and frontline employees
Data analysis: Utilizing qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze the collected data and derive actionable insights

Expected Outcomes:
Identification of best practices: A detailed list of the most effective practices currently employed in the industry
Implementation framework: A step-by-step guide for integrating these practices into our contact center operations
Performance improvement: Enhanced operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and employee engagement
Strategic recommendations: Actionable recommendations for continuous improvement and future innovation in contact center operations

Implications:
The findings from this research will provide the Veteran support team with a clear understanding of what works best in the contact center industry. Implementing these best practices can enhance our contact centers service delivery, improve customer satisfaction, and maintain a competitive advantage. Additionally, this research will serve as a foundation for ongoing learning and development for support agents, ensuring our contact centers remain at the forefront of industry standards.
