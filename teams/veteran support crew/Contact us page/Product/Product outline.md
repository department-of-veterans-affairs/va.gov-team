## Overview
The Contact us page ([va.gov/contact-us](va.gov/contact-us)) on VA.gov helps people get answers to questions about VA benefits and services by connecting people to the following types of customer support channels: self-service, live agent, and asynchronous agent.

## Problem statement
We stood up the Contact us page quickly in 2020 and have made ad-hoc updates since then. It consistently gets the lowest customer satisfaction scores compared to other pages on VA.gov. As of 2024, its CSAT score is around 20%. VA.gov's overall CSAT score is around 60%. View these scores in the [VA.gov CSAT Score Dashboard](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/1545882322).
Many of the responses to the feedback button and intercept surveys through Medallia are related to people’s actual customer service experience (less within our scope to improve):
> I then tried to call your office at the number provided, and ran into a rat maze of menu options, none of which addressed my questions or offered a "something else" option to speak with someone who could help me.

However, some of the responses are related to people’s experience with finding answers and/or contact information (more within our scope to improve):
> i tried to [find] my Diagnostic Code Breakdown Letter but could not find it. i tried using the "help" but nothing was listed, so....??

First, we’ll conduct [usability tests](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/veteran%20support%20crew/Contact%20us%20page/User%20research/09-2024%20Find%20help%20on%20Contact%20us) for the current Contact us page. **Research insights will help us understand the exact challenges we should prioritize when redesigning Contact us.**

## Desired user outcomes
-	**Self-service channels**: People can find solutions independently through resources provided by VA. 
-	**Live agent**: People can find ways to talk to a person in real-time, through calling or chatting with a live agent .
-	**Asynchronous agent**: People can find ways to send messages or questions on their own time and review responses later .
  
## Desired business outcomes
-	People get quicker resolution because they're able to find support more efficiently and easily.
-	More people access VA benefits and services because they're able to resolve blockers through support.
-	People trust VA more because support channels, especially the website, can provide needed answers.

## Measuring Success
See more information in the [Contact us metrics Excel](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/OCTODEVeteranSupportCrew/EUlSMhje2WJDk1YoQvdQh6gBQJ_Gd7ATZh6JuaWYWmVgHg?e=cFgjDM).

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) help us understand how the Contact us page is meeting expected user outcomes. We primarily track the page's satisfaction rating right now. Below is our average satisfaction rating by year compared to VA.gov overall. 

"Satisfaction" scores are from the VFS survey (feedback button). "Experience" scores are from A11 survey (intercept).﻿

### Satisfaction rating by year
|Page|2024 (Latest date: 12/8/24)|2023| 
|----------|-------------| -------------|
|Contact us page|16% (1.1K responses)|12% (1.5K responses)|                     
|All VA.gov pages|30% (103K responses)|22% (96K responses)|

## Assumptions
1.	People will prefer different contact channels in different contexts. For example, if people aren't confident they know which phone number to call, then people will prefer online tools for support. If people feel confident that a phone agent will be able to answer their question, then people will prefer phone calls for support. 
2.	When people already have an expectation on what kind of support channel they want (ex: phone number), they'll feel frustrated if there are additional barriers to getting to that information. 
3.	People land on Contact us when they're already frustrated with a VA experience.

## Solution Approach
- Give people multiple ways to contact VA (calling, messaging, etc.)
- Give people an option to find help on VA.gov through help articles
