## Overview
The Contact us page ([va.gov/contact-us](va.gov/contact-us)) on VA.gov helps people get answers to questions about VA benefits and services by connecting people to the following types of customer support channels: self-service, live agent, and asynchronous agent.

## Problem statement
We stood up the Contact us page quickly in 2020 and have made ad-hoc updates since then. It consistently gets the lowest customer satisfaction scores compared to other pages on VA.gov. As of 2024, its CSAT score is around 20%. VA.gov's overall CSAT score is around 60%. View these scores in the [VA.gov CSAT Score Dashboard](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/1545882322).
Many of the responses to the feedback button and intercept surveys through Medallia are related to people’s actual customer service experience (less within our scope to improve):
> I then tried to call your office at the number provided, and ran into a rat maze of menu options, none of which addressed my questions or offered a "something else" option to speak with someone who could help me.

However, some of the responses are related to people’s experience with finding answers and/or contact information (more within our scope to improve):
> i tried to [find] my Diagnostic Code Breakdown Letter but could not find it. i tried using the "help" but nothing was listed, so....??

First, we’ll conduct [usability tests](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/veteran%20support%20crew/Contact%20us%20page/User%20research/09-2024%20Find%20help%20on%20Contact%20us) for the current Contact us page. **Research insights will help us understand the exact challenges we should prioritize when redesigning Contact us.**

## Desired user outcomes
-	**Self-service channels**: People can find solutions independently through resources provided by VA. 
-	**Live agent**: People can find ways to talk to a person in real-time, through calling or chatting with a live agent .
-	**Asynchronous agent**: People can find ways to send messages or questions on their own time and review responses later .
  
## Desired business outcomes
-	People get quicker resolution because they're able to find support more efficiently and easily.
-	More people access VA benefits and services because they're able to resolve blockers through support.
-	People trust VA more because support channels, especially the website, can provide needed answers.

## Initiatives

## Measuring Success
See more information in our [Product metrics for ‘Contact us’ page](🟡 need to add link) doc.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) help us understand how the Contact us page is meeting expected user outcomes.
We primarily track the page's experience rating right now. Below is our average experience rating by year compared to VA.gov overall. The experience rating comes from answers to "Please rate your experience with VA.gov today." from the page's intercept survey. See all intercept survey questions on the [VA.gov platform site](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/analytics-monitoring/accessing-and-utilizing-contact-center-data#AccessingandUtilizingVeteranSupportData-MedalliaInterceptSurveyQuestions).

### Experience rating
|Year| Contact us page | VA.gov all pages | 
|----------|-------------| -------------|
|2024 (as of 10/22/24)|24% (357 responses)|57% (56k responses)|                     
|2023|18% (518 responses)|52% (71k responses)|

## Assumptions
1.	People will prefer different contact channels in different contexts. For example, if people aren't confident they know which phone number to call, then people will prefer online tools for support. If people feel confident that a phone agent will be able to answer their question, then people will prefer phone calls for support. 
2.	When people already have an expectation on what kind of support channel they want (ex: phone number), they'll feel frustrated if there are additional barriers to getting to that information. 
3.	People land on Contact us when they're already frustrated with a VA experience.

## Solution Approach
