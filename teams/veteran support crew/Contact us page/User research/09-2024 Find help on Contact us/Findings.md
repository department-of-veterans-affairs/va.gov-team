## Veteran journey
The Contact us page can support Veterans at any stage of the Veteran journey because it connects Veterans to VA support channels. For example, Veterans at any stage could call the MyVA411 main information line for information about login issues.

Some support channels may matter more to Veterans depending on where theyâ€™re at too. For example, a Veteran at the Starting up stage might want to call the GI Bill hotline for questions about their education benefits.

## Research Goals
Our research goals are to:  
-	Understand whether people can find the right support (answers or channels) to resolve their issues
-	Understand how people choose phone numbers
-	Understand what people expect on the Contact us page

## Research Questions
Understand whether people can find support (answers or contact information) to resolve their issues:
-	Can people find the answers they need online before deciding to contact VA directly? 
-	How do people navigate within the page to find answers?
-	Do the headings help people find answers? 
-	Do the headings help people find contact information?
-	Do people know which links to select? Do they seem confused? 
-	Can people get their issues resolved on the pages theyâ€™re directed to from â€˜Contact usâ€™?
-	Which support channels do people prefer? Why? 
-	How does the order of contact channels on the page affect peopleâ€™s experience?
  
Understand how people choose phone numbers:
-	How do people find phone numbers on Contact us?
-	How do people decide which phone number they need?
-	What phone number details are useful to decide which phone number they need? Which details donâ€™t help people find phone numbers?
  
Understand what people expect on the Contact us page:
-	Why do people use the Contact us page? 
-	What information are they looking for?
-	What tasks are they hoping they can do on the page?
  
## Methodology 
This was a remote moderated usability study over Zoom for the current Contact us page in VA.gov's production environment at va.gov/contact-us. 

We asked users to consider how they would use Contact us to find answers or customer support in two scenarios in which they have questions about: 
-	Creating a Login.gov account
-	Increasing disability compensation for an existing condition

## Hypotheses and Conclusions
|Hypothesis|Conclusion|Explanation|Scope
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Most of the time, people will be able to find general answers to questions online.|Likely false|Most participants couldn't find answers to in each scenario.|7/10 doesn't support hypothesis|
|It will be more difficult for people to find personalized answers online.|Not enough information|Many people expected to sign in to find answers in each scenario. We didn't test the authenticated experience of searching for answers on VA.gov|6/10 neither support nor disprove|
|People will primarily use the headings to navigate to each section to find answers or contact information.|Definitely true|Almost all of the participants primarily read the headings aloud when scanning pages. They usually skipped over descriptions.|8/10 supports hypothesis|
|People will prefer different contact channels in different contexts.|Mostly true|Most participants chose different contact channels for each scenario. However, some participants also expressed strong preferences for specific channels regardless of context, like VA secure messaging or talking to a live person.|6/10 supports hypothesis|
|People will choose more direct phone numbers rather than general lines to avoid being transferred.|Definitely true|If they chose to call, most participants chose a specific number rather than the MyVA411 main information line. Some even expressed distrust of national phone support numbers in general.|8/10 supports hypothesis|
|People wonâ€™t be highly confident theyâ€™re choosing the right phone number with current phone number details.|Likely False|Most participants were able to choose a phone number with current details available. However, some still expected to be transferred after calling. And some were uncertain about the differences between certain numbers, like the VA benefits hotline compared to the VA health benefits hotline.|6/10 doesn't support hypothesis|
|People primarily use Contact us to look for ways to contact VA (like phone numbers).|Not enough information|We only briefly asked about people's previous experiences contacting VA. Some participants mentioned the Contact us page and some didn't.|7/10 neither support nor disprove|
|People donâ€™t expect to find answers to questions from Contact us.|Not enough information|While some participants ended up navigating to other pages from Contact us, we don't know if they expected this experience starting from the Contact us page. Some weren't surprised at seeing the FAQs section though.|5/10 neither support nor disprove|

## Details of Findings 
Labels that apply to all findings: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: Contact us`, `RESRCH: Remote`, `RESRCH: Usability Testing`, `VAT: Office Chief Technology Officer (OCTO)`

Labels below each finding apply only to the finding.

### Behavior and expectations
#### People scan for words related to their issue to find help and/or contact info.
Scope: 7 out of 10 people

Labels: `TREND: Content`, `TREND: Browsing`

In each scenario, people would scan the Contact us page for related keywords, such as "website access" and "request more compensation." 

> I don't see anything specific about website access.

> So unless it specifically says, how do I request more compensation? So it's not really giving me the question I'm looking for.

For the login scenario, many people gravitated towards the words "help desk" in the "My HealtheVet help desk" label.

>  Right now, I'm skimming for a contact for online support. And the closest thing I see is the My HealtheVet help desk.

For the claims scenario, many people gravitated towards the "Check your VA claim or appeal status" link.

>  I could do this, the claim or appeal... they could check the status of my disability. And also, they could probably update my my disability or give me information if I can apply for greater disability or greater payment.

#### People expected the jump links to direct them to another page.
Scope: 4 out of 10 people

Labels: `DSC: On this page jump link`

After selecting the links, some people would continue scrolling and miss the content of the original link they selected. Not everyone recognized when this happened.

> So once I hit the chat [the jump link], it opened up to learn more about it and ask a question, but it also opened up a 411 information.

> This is the headings for whatever everything I'm looking at now. I just figured that out.

When there are a lot of options on one page, it can be hard to focus and pause on a single section after selecting a jump link.  

> Y'all trying to cram all this stuff into one little thing, and that's what gets people messed up.

> I guess there's too many options. It needs to be more, here's your main thing to do to get to where you need to be.

#### People weren't sure about the purpose of "Helpful online tools."
Scope: 3 out of 10 people

Labels: `DSC: Link - Collection`, `TREND: Content`

People didn't understand how the "Helpful online tools" section would help them find contact information or help. Two participants said the section was "unrelated" and "repetitive."

> "Helpful online tools"... I don't see that as related to everything else... because I could come up with 100 different helpful online tools. This is only four. I don't really know how these are more helpful than any of the other links.  

> "Helpful online tools," just kind of feels repetitive.   

Some people just overlooked the "Helpful online tools" label and skipped to the links in the section. 

> When you get a hyperlink like this where it says, "Change your address," or anything like that, you click on that, and it'll take you right to the page that you need to go to the either change the address or change the direct deposit or you need to change your VA claim or anything.

#### People related "Contact us online through Ask VA" to chat support.
Scope: 4 out of 10 people

Labels: `TREND: Content`

While some people interpreted "Contact us online through Ask VA" correctly, some did not. Ask VA is a contact form. Some people thought it was related to chat. They focused on the label and less on the descriptive text below it. 

> I expect that in a timely manner, I'll get a reply back either confirming that they got the message or asking for a little more information, what I'm trying to say, or they'll give me an answer.

> ...probably be presented with a contact us form with lots of dropdowns to try and narrow...

> I'm assuming to be a chat, some kind of chat functionality.

> Now it looks like I may be able to get kind of a chat going. That's what I would think so. Because if it's online, it has to be some kind of chat, am I correct?... Oh, it doesn't say question and answer. I just put that in myself.  

### People misinterpreted "Resources and support" but understood "FAQs."
Scope: 4 out of 10 people

Labels: `TREND: Content`

"Resources and support" is a separate area on VA.gov. It provides more specific support-related content that doesn't fit under benefits hub pages. People interpreted the words "resources" and "support" differently.

> Resources would be other resources that are not affiliated with the VA, but the VA, you know, puts them out there because they're real and legit resources... Support, I would hope, would be an actual person. Either an actual person or an e-mail.

Because the label "Explore our FAQs and other resources to get answers to your questions" doesn't explicitly include the words "Resources and support," most people still understood the purpose of this section though. 

They understood what FAQs were. 

> One thing that does that stick out to me is the frequently asked questions. So I might look there to see if there are any topics that might be helpful. How to use VA.gov to manage your benefits, it might be there.

> Frequently asked questions popped in my head as something I should look at to see if it's something that could be of assistance.

### People weren't sure how "VA benefits hotline" and "VA health benefits hotline" are different.
Scope: 2 out of 10 people

Labels: `TREND: Content`

Some people understood there might be a difference, but they weren't sure what the difference between these numbers is.

> VA health benefits is again the same thing, similar to the one above. I'm not sure why you have it twice. There's a health benefits and then benefits. I guess they're different.

>  So I see the first VA benefits hotline, and I'm just going to go ahead and keep glancing just for grins and giggles. And there's the health benefits hotline now. Then there's a MyHealtheVet help desk. And now I'm kind of confused as they are three separate numbers.

### Preferences
#### People prefer more direct phone numbers.
Scope: 5 out of 10 people

Labels: `DSC: Telephone`

People overwhelmingly don't have high expectations for phone calls. They prefer more direct phone numbers to mitigate the risk of long hold times, generic answers, transfers, and unhelpful phone agents.

> At least if I call local, I can talk to somebody and say, here's my problem.

> I want a VSO. I want I want the phone number of a VSO.

> It's like, I wanna talk to the EPA and I've got the White House. I'm on the White House page. So I'm a little too high up in the chain, you know, to be looking for the best phone number to begin with.

> I like that it was split up where it's not one general number to call...I know way back in the dinosaur age there was one phone number, and you could be on there for days.

VA markets the MyVA411 number to [reduce the complexity of trying to find the right phone number](https://news.va.gov/82379/1-800-myva411/). However, people either don't understand 411 or have had subpar experiences with national numbers. They would still prefer a direct number in comparison to a national number.

> The 411 in there throws me, and maybe it's 'cause I'm in a rural [location] area... get rid of the MyVA411 and just have "main information" would I guess draw my attention more. 

> The further away from the locale you are in almost every institution, the more difficult. I mean, whether it's the Social Security office here in town versus calling a 800 number, 800 numbers are just not as successful for me, I would guess.

### People prefer using search, but searches aren't always successful on VA.gov.
Scope: 4 out of 10 people

Labels: `TREND: Search`, `PRDT: On-site-search`, `DSC: Search Input`

People tried searching for answers on VA.gov either through the main search tool or the search on the "Resources and support" page. Most people weren't successful with finding an answer. 

> And even if I take away all this and just say "create account"... [Reading results] VA prescription refill and tracking download letters, upgrade premium My HealtheVet, change your direct deposit. You know, nothing there fits what I'm looking for.

People suggested a better search to improve the Contact us page and VA.gov.

> I mean, it would be great to have a search bar and everything that would actually answer that on the main page.

> Search bar is my favorite thing. So I will usually search it unless I know exactly where I'm going.

> So it's just a matter of a search bar that is not limited

### People prefer talking to real people and online messaging (chat or email).
Scope: 8 out of 10 people

Labels: `PRDT: Secure-messaging`, `MHV: Secure Messaging`, `PRDT: AVA`

People like talking to real people and dislike automation, like phone trees and chatbots. Automation doesn't work as well (right now) as talking to a real person.

> if I know I don't know the answer and I'm not just fooling around on the, on the website, it's easier to just ask somebody.

>  sometimes even no matter how good the, the chat is, sometimes you just need a live person to, you know, to walk you through

Many people talked about their positive experiences with VA secure messaging. For one participant, VA secure messaging was their go-to support tool for all questions.

> I'm in contact with my providers quite frequently with the secure messaging, but I'm not aware of the "Contact us" or whatever you just said page on VA.gov.

>  I'm a big secure message person... Yeah, I can go do something and wait for the e-mail to come back. I would hope to have a response within 24 hours.

In general, people prefer online messaging because it's more convenient.

> A lot of times, 3:00 in the morning, I'm going to write an e-mail because by 7-8 o'clock the next day, I'm going to forget it.

> [Talking about Ask VA] If I put in a secure request, you know, that's going to take at least a day, depending on what day it is, which is super fast, you know, from my experience in the government, super fast and really like it.

## Additional Insights
Please see additional findings in [this separate GitHub doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/veteran%20support%20crew/Contact%20us%20page/User%20research/09-2024%20Find%20help%20on%20Contact%20us/Additional%20findings.md).

## Recommendations
### Add descriptions to phone numbers
- **Hypothesis**: If we add descriptions to better explain the purpose of each VA phone number, then users will read the descriptions and understand which phone number can help them the most.
- **Risks**: We know people primarily read headings to scan. Some people don't read body text. The Contact us page will also become longer if we continue added content to it.
- **Mitigating risks**: Consider the Contact us page as a multi-page experience. Or hide content through accordions, additional info, or other components.
- **Measuring impact**: Clicks on phone number links 

### Update "Contact us online through Ask VA" heading
- **Hypothesis**: If we update the heading to better explain what Ask VA is, then users will choose to send an online message to VA more.
- **Risks**: Any language around "messaging" may get conflated with VA secure messaging.
- **Mitigating risks**: Consider grouping VA secure messaging and Ask VA under a single "messaging" label
- **Measuring impact**: Clicks on Ask VA link

### Add VA secure messaging
- **Hypothesis**: If we add a link to VA secure messaging, then users will know where to send messages to their VA health care team.
- **Risks**: The Contact us page will become longer if we continue added content to it. People may think they can ask questions that their care team can't answer. People may choose VA secure messaging rather than Ask VA when Ask VA is more appropriate. 
- **Mitigating risks**: Consider the Contact us page as a multi-page experience. Clarify the distinction between Ask VA and VA secure messaging.
- **Measuring impact**: Clicks to VA secure messaging

### Update "Helpful online tools" heading
- **Hypothesis**: If we update the heading to better explain what users can use helpful online tools for, then users will choose to access online tools more. 
- **Risks**: n/a 
- **Mitigating risks**: n/a 
- **Measuring impact**: Clicks to online tools

### Add description to "Helpful online tools" section
- **Hypothesis**: If we add descriptions to better explain what users can use helpful online tools for, then users will read the description and understand helpful online tools.
- **Risks**: We know people primarily read headings to scan. Some people don't read body text. The Contact us page will also become longer if we continue added content to it.
- **Mitigating risks**: Consider the Contact us page as a multi-page experience.
- **Measuring impact**: Clicks to online tools

 ### Identify top-used online tools and add them to the page (possibly compare with what's in the VA mobile app)
- **Hypothesis**: If we identify top-used online tools, then users will be more likely find online tools that will help them.
- **Risks**: People may not find the tool they need in our list of tools. 
- **Mitigating risks**: Consider redirecting people somewhere else if they can't find what they're looking for.
- **Measuring impact**: Clicks to online tools

## Next Steps
- **Review recommednations**: On 10/31, Becky to review recommendations with Chante, Beth, and Danielle.
- **Update Contact us page**: Beth and Danielle can help update content on Contact us.
- **Further design exploration and research**: Becky can lead on further exploration and research.

## Further design exploration and research needed
### Reconsider order of Contact us page to be more topic-driven
One key finding was that [people scan for words related to their issue to find help and/or contact info](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/veteran%20support%20crew/Contact%20us%20page/User%20research/09-2024%20Find%20help%20on%20Contact%20us/Findings.md#people-scan-for-words-related-to-their-issue-to-find-help-andor-contact-info). We should explore what this might look like, and how it might align more with our Resources and support experience.

### Split Contact us page into multiple pages
The Contact us page is long and will get longer if we add more content. We should explore a multi-page experience using the one-thing per page principle ([see guidance from the GOV.UK service design manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/form-structure#start-with-one-thing-per-page)). This may also help us consider a helpful Contact us expeience on the VA mobile app too. 

### Add search directly on Contact us page
Another key finding was that [people prefer using search, but searches aren't always successful on VA.gov.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/veteran%20support%20crew/Contact%20us%20page/User%20research/09-2024%20Find%20help%20on%20Contact%20us/Findings.md#some-people-misinterpreted-resources-and-support-but-understood-faqs) The Content, Information Architecture, and Editor Experiences Crew is already planning on prioritizing a better search experience on VA.gov, so we'll share this finding with them. We should also explore how to leverage search directly on Contact us to help people find either information articles or contaction information more efficiently.

### Update "Resources and support" to something more recognizable like "Help" 
We learned that [some people misinterpreted "Resources and support" but understood "FAQs."](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/veteran%20support%20crew/Contact%20us%20page/User%20research/09-2024%20Find%20help%20on%20Contact%20us/Findings.md#some-people-misinterpreted-resources-and-support-but-understood-faqs) The Content, Information Architecture, and Editor Experiences Crew is also planning on revisting the Resources and Support experience, so we'll share our findings. We should consider if renaming Resources and support will make direct more people to this area of VA.gov and help them find answers.
