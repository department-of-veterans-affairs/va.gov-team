## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
Becky: And it looks like now we are ready to get started.

> P12: OK, Yeah.

Becky: And first, I'd like to learn more just about your experience with VA and VA customer support. So to start off, around how long have you been a veteran?

> P12: Oh, I enlisted in [year] in the United States Marine Corps and served [number] years active and [number] years inactive.

> P12: But obviously as a public school teacher, I wasn't eligible for VA benefits of any kind. OK, so I've only been, I was given VA medical benefits because I was a Marine stated at Camp Lejeune with the Water Act passed by Congress.

> P12: So once that became available, then I initially just kind of made some contacts. And the more experiences I had, the more positive I was. And short little note, to be honest, if I didn't have a wife, I'd probably use the VA exclusively, especially before I was [number].

> P12: I'm [number] now, but before I was [number], I retired at [number]. So there are some really expensive healthcare programs that you have to pay for until you get on Medicare. So, you know, you're not going to hear a lot of complaints from me about the VA.

> P12: I'll be honest. So I was in private medical care until Congress made me eligible. And then I slowly moved over different parts of my medical care to the VA to the point where virtually everything I do now is through the VA.

Becky: Yeah. That's really good to hear. You know, while while it is helpful to hear, you know, those negative experiences as well, I'm glad in your case, you know, it seems like things have have been working out pretty well. I'm curious...

> P12:  And also I will say the only negative is occasionally if things take too long.

[P12 discusses a health care experience.]

Becky: Yeah, no technology is really amazing nowadays, and I'm glad you know, doctors at VA are utilizing that. I'm curious in your experiences, too. So it sounds like you use VA mostly for health benefits.

Becky: And so have you have ever had the experience of maybe not knowing who to contact for something and then trying to look up contact information on our website before?

> P12: Yes. And generally what I have found is the easiest thing to do is I have one person, [name], I think his, I think I forget his name.

> P12: But in my emails when I go online, I see, I see a list of people I can contact. If I have to contact the pharmacy, ask a pharmacist, they may they reply.
 
> P12: But almost everything else, if I want something, I almost always just jot a note to the nurse and say, hey, I've got a weird question, what do I do about this?

> P12: They're very quick about replying, getting, you know, the weird things when you try to get like an eye appointment or something.

> P12: I don't know how effective the scheduling of that is, but they eventually have to call you back anyway. But no, they're always good about letting me know my own ignorance of a particular avenue that I've never been to.

[P12 discusses health care experience.]

> P12: But anyway, things like that, when you don't know what to do and you call somebody, you sometimes get an odd answer. But generally I'm very happy with them working out.

> P12: You know, me sending them a note to my primary care at the VA and them just saying, oh, you got to do this. And sometimes they're not on my list still of people I'm allowed to e-mail. It's not like we have a directory of anybody we can e-mail. We only get, we get a pull down menu on the website.

> P12: When you wanna slip a message, you get a pull down menu that says you can, you know, cardiology or pharmacy or whatever.

> P12: So generally, if I don't know who to call, I just call the main guy and they tell me.

Becky: Yeah. It sounds like, you know, you've been talking about, I think. Are you talking about VA secure messaging, like the messaging?

> P12: Yes. 

Becky: OK, great. I just wanted to confirm, but no, that that's great. I'm wondering, do you ever try to look for answers online first or do you go straight to maybe trying to contact someone?

> P12: No, I, I mean, I've explored the website. I used to design websites years ago. I mean, I've been on the Internet since [year]. So I mean published on it and things like that.

> P12: So I'm, I'm actually kind of fascinated with what things work well and what things don't. I would say I, I do some exploring, but I will say it's easier just to, you know, if I know I don't know the answer and I'm not just fooling around on the, on the website, it's easier to just ask somebody.
 
> P12: You know, it's like a plumbing problem. I had no school. I was a history teacher. So I have a plumbing problem. I'm beyond trying to fix it. I used to do that.

> P12: I had a few family, you know, plumbing was like something to explore, but, you know, it's just so easy because they're in it every day and they know what you're, you're not the first veteran who had that question. That's my thought.
 
> P12: So, yeah. And they're always so helpful. I I mean, they respond immediately if I, I mean, sometimes I'll be on a Saturday or Sunday and I'll send a note. Pharmacist works on Saturdays and replies right away.

> P12: My, my guy, [location] or whatever time they get to work, it's like I get a response and I need to see somebody and they're like, we'll call you and get you set up. So I have no complaints there.

Becky: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. That, that totally makes sense, especially if you can expect a good response from what you're using right now.
 
> P12: Right.

Becky: And maybe one final thing I wanted to ask before we move into some scenarios we'll go through is what information do you usually expect on a contact us page? What do you think you might find on a page that you know it?

> P12: It's like that contact information page on websites. The things I really want to know immediately are, is somebody going to get back to me soon? So in other words, if your hours are 8:00 to 5:00 Monday through Friday, then I won't expect to reply on Saturday.

> P12: But I have found, like with the pharmacy, there's somebody working there not 24/7, but there's somebody working there on Saturdays because they totally respond. So I'm like, oh, that's cool. I don't think they work on Sundays, but yeah, ours are a phone number.

> P12: If I really needed something, I, I fortunately, other than the stroke, I haven't had an emergency need that that quickly.

> P12: And, and to me, this is going to sound arrogant and I don't mean to sound arrogant, but I worked hard and I made enough money that if it's an emergency, I honestly don't care who's going to pay for it. Does that make sense?

> P12: Like there's no doubt that one of the reasons I'm using the VA is that frequently they pay for everything or they, you know, [name] [number] a month.

> P12: It cost me 8 through the VA. So not to use the VA pharmacy would be stupid. So on the other hand, if I can't breathe, I'm calling the life squad.

> P12: I'm not going to wait for the VA to find out whether it's covered or not because it doesn't matter to me. I want to stay alive.

> P12: So I may be in a different situation, which I don't like to say that, but I may be in a different situation that I'm not as bound by the restrictions of I have to use the VA, I don't have to use the VA, I use the VA because it's convenient, it's less expensive, and they seem to do as good or better work than anybody in the private sector.

[P12 talks baout health experience.]

Becky: Yeah, yeah, that does make sense. And it's really helpful to hear your your thought process through, you know, using your benefits too. So yeah, thanks for explaining some of those experiences with the A so far.

> P12: Sure.

## Scenarios
Becky: All right. Well, we'll move into the next part of the session. And I'll, I'm going to give you 2 scenarios where you, as a veteran would reach out to VA for help. And these scenarios are actually real questions that veterans asked us this year. They've just been reworded.

Becky: All right. So before we do that, though, I will send a link to our current contact Us page on va.gov and let me know when you've opened that and it shouldn't be in your chat.

[P12 screen shares.]

### Claims scenario
Becky: All right, so we can pause for a second here while I give you your first scenario.

> P12: All right.

Becky: All right. So in this case, you're a veteran and you currently get disability compensation for some shoulder pain. And you noticed your shoulder has been hurting more in the past couple of months, but you don't know if you can request more compensation than you're getting right now for this worsening pain.

Becky: So starting on this page, show me how you would find help for this scenario. And as you're showing me, tell me what you're thinking and noticing too.

> P12: Well, in looking at this page, I would probably first ask the chatbot a question because I find that fascinating because the tech, I'm a tech guy.

> P12: So because I did actually ask about this disability compensation for [condition]. And I was actually told by my, and, and I will tell you what exactly what I did.

> P12:I sent an E as I told you I do. I sent a note to my primary care. He's not a physician. I think he's a physician physician, but I'm in one team. So I sent it to the team and said is that something you can answer?

> P12: And she said no. We only deal with if you have a medical problem. There's a separate section for compensation. Here's the phone number. You should call them and they will have access to your files.

> P12: So I don't want to say I know the answer to the question, but I have recently asked that question of the VA and that's what I did.

Becky: So no, that that's helpful to hear that experience. So it sounds like they couldn't answer your question, but they were able to redirect you to maybe a different phone number you could call, right?

> P12: That that's what led me to they made a, they made an appointment for me for the [condition] and I sent them copies of all my recent [health info].

> P12: He looked them over. Then he did a video conference with me. I have not followed up yet with the people in charge of compensation. I have another meeting with him in the middle of [month] after [number] days with his new settings, and I was kind of waiting for that, to be honest.

Becky: Yeah, I'm curious. Maybe we'll learn something new here. But do you want to go ahead and click the chat bot link and and see and go through this as as you're in the scenario? So you said you'd use the chat bot and yeah, just show me what you'd do next.

> P12: I would click on learn about the chat bot, start the chat.

Becky: OK. 

> P12: And then it was I would say can my disability payment slash level be changed because I am in more pain.

> P12: And then I would to clarify, did you mean claims information ratings, I think it's called your rating depending on what you, you need to sign in to see your disability, you'd like to sign in now. So then I would sign in.

Becky: OK, Yeah. And why would you sign in at this point because it says would you like to do that?

> P12: So I would assume that's going to take me to see the disability ratings and maybe I can read something that would say depending.
 
> P12: I don't know what the disability is for a sore shoulder, but maybe it would say if your pain levels increase. I don't think they would. But like I said, it seemed to be easier just to e-mail the VA and they would say Nope. For compensation. You got to talk to these people. Here's their phone number, call them.
 
> P12: And I don't, I don't think that is a negative. I don't think they're like sloughing me off. I think there are people that handle the medical in the VA and they're probably people that handle disability.

> P12: I've never been on a disability, so I don't know. But.

> P12: Right. Yeah, the, the VA is quite, quite complex. Yeah.

> P12: Yes. And nobody can, nobody can know everything. But it is nice that it seems like my PA team knows how to redirect me.

[P12 talks about health experience.]

Becky: Look at looking at this page. You, you mentioned you would sign in. So we're not gonna, I'll, I won't ask you to sign in today. But let's say you sign in and you don't quite get the answer you need. What would you do next?
 
> P12: Well, like I said, I would attempt to find an answer on the web page 'cause I am kind of a self help kind of person. I want to solve my own problems.  
 
> P12: But then I would contact my they seem to my primary care seems to be efficient at solving problems. So I would contact them and I've never been unhappy with their way to resolve the issue.

Becky: OK, yeah. Can you show me how you would do either of those things or you find help or, or reach out to your, your primary care team. And again, you don't have to sign in to show me anything. Just like up until that point maybe.

> P12: Well, that's what I would do. I would sign into my VA account and send them a secure message and they seem to reply very quickly. I mean, I don't, I have no, they reply faster than my private doctor's reply.

Becky: I'm curious too, where are you? Where are you finding that link to secure messaging?
 
> P12: Oh, so this will sound weird. In a prior life when I was a high school teacher early at mid [number], I started working on website design. So I actually have my own homepage that I have designed with all the links for the Internet that I generally use. 

> P12: So I have Ava Health link, I click on that, it asked me to log in. When I log in, there's pharmacy messaging and I just compose a message from a pull down menu that says ask a pharmacist, [name]'s team, cardiology, whatever are available to me.
 
Becky: Got it. So you're, you've already, you know, you have experience with the link first already. So you've saved it and then you just select that that link that you've saved already.

Becky: Yeah, I guess for the sake of for the sake of the scenario, let's say you don't have that saved link. How would you go about finding that link from the VA.gov website?

> P12: OK, so I I never would type in VA.gov because I always so so under can you see my phone? So on my phone are my health apps all linked together?

> P12: One of them is VA connect and one's for [redacted], one's for my [redacted]. So I'm I'm I'm probably more technologically proficient than your average ex Marine, I'll put it that way.

> P12: How's that? That nicely said. So there is a, so I can, I can click on the VA on my phone and it'll bring up the app and will allow me to immediately then sign on at the VA.

> P12: So, I mean, if I were, if I were desperate, my wife was shopping and I had nothing better to do and was just exploring the website or something.

> P12: I mean, I don't know. But yeah, I it's, it's a link that's in all my browsers that I know where I'm going to go, when I'm going to go.

Becky: No, that, that's really helpful. Yeah, to see the the app as well, since we haven't really talked about the VA app too. But it sounds like, you know, in the scenario you would go to the app and then you know that you could message there.

> P12: Yes.

Becky: Great. All right, well, let's go back to the contact us page and I'll give you our 2nd and final scenario, which is a bit different from this one.

> P12: OK, let me click on contact us again.

### Login scenario
Becky: All right, so again, in this scenario, you're a veteran and this time your problem is that you can't create an account on va.gov.

Becky: So you're trying to create a login.gov account, but login.gov isn't letting you use your passport to verify your identity and you don't have your driver's license because you lost it recently.

Becky: So all is all you have is your passport and login.gov isn't letting you create an account with with just the passport to verify your identity starting on this page.

Becky: Show me how you'd find help for this scenario and tell me what you're thinking and noticing too.

> P12: Well I need to be redundant but literally if I can't figure it out by reading through this I would go back to my originalva.gov link and say this login isn't working again. I hate to be a broken record but I have had no trouble with the login.

> P12: Idi find it oddly and I would say madding, but it's almost like the VA has tried to change the way you log in for like 3 years and it's still offering me all three options when I log in. 

> P12: I don't know why it's still doing that other than maybe there's arguments about whether you should be allowed to do that or not. But I don't like there continually being choices to login because maybe I'm missing something or it's not being updated properly if you don't log in this way.

> P12: And I I generally don't choose login ID because it takes longer if I just choose the health health vet. So what's the word for it I'm looking for? I will show you. Hang on. Yeah, this is what my web page looks like.

> P12: I just made that few years ago and so there is a link on there that says VA Health.

> P12: So when I click on that, it always gives me 3 choices, right, to log in, right. The regular health, health vet. My health vet is the way I generally do it because it works faster, it's seamless.

> P12: I do a lot of downloading of the blue ribbon report just to see, you know, if I want to see my blood work or something a few days after I take it. I, I love the fact that you can see those notes on there and stuff like that.
 
> P12: So, but, but again, I would message somebody and say, you know, I'm not able to get on there with login ID, but you don't need login ID for my health vet. So that's why I use it.

Becky: Yeah, yeah, I'll throw a I'll throw a wrench in this scenario and yeah, let so, but you know, I totally hear you.

Becky: And this is what I'm going to take away too, that you know, your secure messaging through my healthy vet that's really working for you. You're getting good responses.

Becky: But in this case you, you don't have an account at all. So you can't even log into do that secure messaging.

Becky: And So what the problem is, is that you're trying to create an account and you can't. So what would you do to get help if you couldn't log in?

> P12: It's like 10 minute drive to the clinic. I would probably go up to the clinic and say what's the problem? You guys have told me I have to do this login ID and it's not doing it and somebody there would be helpful.

> P12: I'm not going to allow myself hours and hours of frustration of trying to. And I, I wouldn't do that immediately. I know with all technology, you know, restart the computer, give it 10 minutes.

> P12: The system might be down or there. There are a number of reasons. But I mean, eventually if it doesn't work, I would go up there and say, you all told me I had to use VA login ID and it's not working. So what are you going to do now?

> P12: And probably take my computer with me, 'cause I mean, I use pretty new computers and stuff, but maybe it's my fault. Maybe I click something. I don't know.

> P12: But yeah, I mean, we had to 1st. I mean, to get benefits, you had to go to the office. And I mean, they do, they will allow video conferencing on some things. And so I'm not up there probably as often as I might have been years ago.

> P12: But yeah, I mean, they're very helpful.

Becky: And yeah, so, yeah, I mean, no, that's so interesting to hear.

> P12: Oh, God, I will be honest, I don't think I would dial the 800 number as quickly as I would just drive up there only because, A, they're so friendly, B, they're so successful in helping me. And C, no offense, but you dial an 800 number and you have no idea who you're going to get.

> P12: I mean, it could be somebody in Washington and you got to wait 20 minutes to talk to them. And the further away from the locale you are in almost every institution, the more difficult, I mean whether it's Social Security office here in town versus calling a 800 number, 800 numbers are just not as successful for me, I would guess.

Becky: I would say yeah, that it is so fascinating to hear you, your expectations that you you expect a better response if you just go in person and like physically drive to your local location versus maybe staying at home and calling this number where you aren't sure what the response is gonna be. Is, is that a good summary?

> P12: I am sure that every time I walk into the local VA in [location], I'm going to be treated with respect.

> P12: They're going to be friendly. Nobody's going to say, well, you know, in the Army they could figure this out, but the Marine Corps apparently has trouble there. I'm never going to hear a remark like that.

> P12: So I couldn't be happier with the quality of care I'm getting or with the assistance I'm getting. But like I said, I'm also pretty technologically proficient. I doubt whether I don't want to say that won't happen to me, but I'm who people call when they have problems like that.

> P12: And I usually tell them, well, restart, let's click again, again, Let's, you know, restart the computer. Let's do these, you know, there's like 10 things you can do before you have to ask for help. That's why I became tech coordinator, I guess. But yeah.

Becky: That's good to hear. I'll just for the sake of testing this page, I will say like let's say you know you want to go to your local VA center, but you don't know where it's located.

> P12: So well I will tell you that we winter in [location] and so finding a VA location in [location] that was very helpful because it turns out there is a local office in [location], which is close.

> P12: The 1st hospital is [location]. And then, you know, if I ever moved to [location], certainly around [location] there seem to be a lot of Navy people. So they have a VA hospital down there.

> P12: So I, I have done some exploration of the website in terms of, we're not ready to move to [location], but access to care would certainly be among those things that are important when you're nearing [number] years old.
 
> P12: So, yeah, that contact your local facility, finding local VA facilities. Yeah. And my, before he passed my father-in-law, we found him a facility over in [location] so he could get some things. He didn't think he was eligible.

> P12: And I'm like, well, you don't even know if you're eligible. If they tell you you're not eligible, let's go ask, you know, 'cause I found the very helpful. So I don't know.

> P12: Yeah. And I, I do spend time, you know, kind of looking around, but yeah, I have no problems with with everything.

Becky: Yeah. Yeah, I guess I'm curious. Could you show me how you would maybe find a location in in [location] if you're didn't already know that or you know you or you can pick any put any random combination of numbers or location in.

> P12: So we winter in [location].

Becky: OK.

> P12: And then I know there's different kinds of facilities. It was a little bit, it was a little bit confusing because in [location] they seem to say that I think it's this a let me see, yeah, ER to you.
 
> P12: Like, I would like to know. And and it doesn't tell me on this web page if I had an emergency, is that where I'm supposed to go? Because it's like a mobile thing that comes to the condo. That seems to be a really expensive thing to do, but it doesn't. I guess it'd be nice if there were some way for it to tell me you could go there, but it's going to cost you more.

> P12: Or you could go there, but if you can drive to a facility, we'd like you to do that.

> P12: Now, of course, when I was [experience] and the woman said you could drive to [location], I was like, no, I'll just go in [location]. At the time there was a hospital in [location].

> P12: They've since closed it, but it, it there is a one, there is still 1 closed, a hospital closed. So I'd be like, no, I'm not going to drive anywhere. But yeah, that ER2U. I was, that was an odd one. But yeah, when I looked at that, I was like, wonder what that is?  

Becky: Yeah, yeah. And I see you, you filtered for urgent care. I see you're talking specifically just to confirm about your your [experience] and, and what you did. OK. Yeah. Does does the service type help you understand sort of what you're asking?

Becky: Like which which one should I go to? Like what am I...

> P12: No, that's what I'm saying. It doesn't really tell me it it seems to consider these all equal. Like I would think the closest one, if it's an emergency, you would go there. But that closest one is actually ER to you is a service where they I think they like come with an ambulance or something.

> P12: I don't know if that's, I didn't want to call an ambulance or, you know, I don't know that I was that confuses me and still does. Quite frankly, I'd, I'd probably still go to the hospital just because it's more traditional. I don't know.

Becky: Got it. Yeah, I I can definitely see that. You know, I, I read ER2U and I'm not quite sure what that means to versus like hospital. I know what a hospital is, so. 

> P12: Walk in the emergency room. So whatever I needed. But like I said, they they seem to cover, at least they did with my [experience].

[P12 discuss medical experience.]

Becky: But I guess are you saying to like on this page? It would be helpful to not have to assume that or like for that to be more clear, more upfront, maybe more direct.

[P12 discuss medical experience.]

Becky: All right, well, I think this brings us to maybe the end of our scenario. So you can go ahead and stop sharing your screen at the top.

[P12 stops screen sharing.]

## Review each scenario
### Contact us online through Ask VA
Becky: But I know that, you know, while we're working on improving the contact us page, I'm wondering if it'd be helpful if I showed you how some of these contact options work right now in case you're interested.

> P12: Sure.

Becky: OK, great. So I will share my own screen and I'll go through what you might expect if you had gone down the paths of of some of the other contact options we didn't go through.

[Becky reviews each option.]

> P12: Is that available now?

Becky: Yes, this is available now.

> P12: So that would probably be a place where when I am ready to ask them about a disability rating, I would probably go in there and start there. 

Becky: Yeah, yeah, since it would go directly to the the team that handles those sorts of questions and it can be complicated. So in your case, it's probably going to be disability compensation.

Becky: And then, you know, you can just select the right topic that fits there.

> P12: Yeah. Oh, that's cool.

Becky: Yeah. 

> P12: That's helpful.

Becky: Yeah. Do you have any other thoughts or questions, reactions to this first tool?

> P12: No, I like it that it in red says this is required. I like it when you do that so that you don't. If you miss one, they come back and say, no, you didn't fill this out yet.

> P12: It's required. I like it when it tells you you got to fill all those out.

### Ask our chatbot a question
Becky: But pausing here, did you have any thoughts or reactions to the chat bot when you first tried it?

> P12: No, I'm, I'm familiar with them. I I know how they work. And I know that they're, you know, canned questions and canned answers. And that's OK. It's a good place to start. Yeah.

### Contact your local VA facility
Becky: So that's what you might expect if you called your local facility versus going in person.

> P12: And I will say, I rarely would call them directly because it's not as effective as emailing you e-mail. You get somebody's going to e-mail back pretty quickly.

> P12: And then if they call you back, it's an irritating thing, but they're calling you from a number you can't call back to. They're going to give you a number to call back to, but then you're going to get the right person. So I wouldn't call when I'm given the number to call, not general numbers because you're, I don't see you're going to get the runaround, but you're, it's going to take a while for somebody to specifically.

> P12: Whereas if they're calling you back and they give you an extension or whatever, boom, you're right on their desk. And that, you know, with making appointments and stuff, they, they're very good about that. And you've got the schedule. You call them and you can schedule.

Becky: All right. It sounds like the more direct numbers have have been more helpful.

> P12: Yes. But they don't publish your directory. You gotta right. There's there's no, well, not to my knowledge, but there's no page with all of the direct numbers to any of these things.

Becky: Yeah, although, well, caveat to that, we do have another page just real quick of more specific numbers and it's not as comprehensive as showing like someone's extension, but there are more specific numbers for like specific programs like this one Champ VA or the foreign medical program.

Becky: So this would be the page I was talking about of more specific numbers of what we have publicly available right now.
