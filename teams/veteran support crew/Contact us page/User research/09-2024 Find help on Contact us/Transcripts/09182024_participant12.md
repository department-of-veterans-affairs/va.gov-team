## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
[ I enlisted in 1974 in the Marine Corps, served two years active and 4 years inactive, but I was a public school teacher and was not eligible for VA healthcare benefits. I was given VA medical benefits because I was stationed in Camp Lejeune. 
I was in private medical care and slowly moved some parts of my medical care to the VA and now all through the VA. ]
*Have you used Contact Us?- Yes, generally the easiest thing to do is, in my emails, if I want something, I make a note to the Nurse and ask her a question and they are quick at replying. They are good at letting me know of avenues to go. If I don’t know who to call, I call the main guy ( VA secure messaging).
*Do you explore for answers on the website? - I used to explore the website and I used to design websites. I do some exploring but it’s easier if I don’t know, it’s easier to ask someone.
*What information do you expect on a Contact Us page? – The thing I want to know are is someone going to get back to me soon. I have found that at the pharmacy there will be someone there and I will get a response on a Saturday. I haven’t had an emergency need that quickly. ]

## Scenarios
### Login scenario
[I would as Chatbot the question because I find that fascinating and I’m a tech guy. For example, I sent a note to my Team and asked them if is that something they could answer, there's a separate section for compensation, here is the number.
I would click Learn about the Chatbot, start the chat, then I would sign in. I would sign because it says if I would like to do that and see my disability rating. It seems it would be easier to email the VA and them to respond, “Here is a list of numbers on where to call”. No one can know everything, but my PA’s teams seem to know where to redirect me.
*What step would you take next to get your answer? -I would contact my primary care and I have never been unhappy at how they do that. I would sign into my VA account and send a secure message. 
How would you go back to find that link? I would not search the VA. I can click on the VA app and explore]
### Claims scenario
[If I can’t figure it out by reading this, I would go to VA.gov and type this link is not working. It’s almost like the VA has tried to change how to log in for the past three years. I don’t like that there is numerous ways to log in. If I choose VA Health, it gives me three choices to log in, I used My HealtheVet because it’s easier to do it.
It’s a 10 minute drive, I would just drive there and get help. I wouldn’t spend hours and hours on the internet. I don’t think I would dial the 1800 instead of driving to my clinic because they are always helpful. I couldn’t be happier with the quality care I’m getting at the VA. Finding a VA in Florida is very easy. I have done some exploration of the website and we aren’t ready to move to Florida but there’s a lot of VA’s in Florida. 
*Can you show me? – Typed Venice FL (Find VA location). This page doesn’t tell you if I had an emergency, it doesn’t tell you where I need to go. 
They don’t say this, I thought when I got VA care, I thought they would treat what I have and sometimes you pay and sometimes you don’t.]

## Review each scenario
[I like that in red it says, “this is required”.
*Any thoughts on the Chatbot? -No, I’m familiar with how they work. It’s a good place to start. 
It’s irritating that I’ll be on my computer and it will ask me for my phone for the multifactor. ]

## Cool down
[A way to get to your local directory if there were such a thing. In terms of Contact Us, I just contact my Team, it just works out better for me that way.]
