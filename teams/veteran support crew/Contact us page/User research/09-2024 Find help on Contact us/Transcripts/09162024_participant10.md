## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
Becky: And now we're ready to get started and we're going to start first by learning more about maybe your experience with VA and VA customer support. So firstly, how long have you been a veteran?

> P10: Oh, wow, I've been a veteran. Oh, over over what, [nnumber] years now?

Becky: Wow, that, that is quite some time. Yeah, Yeah, yeah, in, in that time. This is pretty new, but have you used the contact US page on va.gov at all?

> P10: I'm sorry, have I used what?

Becky: The contact us page on va.gov?

> P10: Yes.

Becky: OK. Can you walk me through maybe your most recent experience with using that page?

> P10: Yeah, Well, I used it because I needed to find, I needed to ask a question. So I I used it 'cause you can ask the chat bot a question.

> P10: I needed some phone numbers to be able to contact. What I was trying to get to get was I needed some questions answered and I needed someone to a few questions.
 
> P10: I needed to know where where some documents were. And it seems like, you know, I used to be able to go out to E benefits since things have moved around. And so now I don't know where things are anymore.

Becky: Right. And you mentioned using the chat bot. Were you able to find the information you were looking for by asking the chat bot?

> P10: No.

Becky: OK. Yeah, why? Why was why was that difficult? Or can you walk me through what you did to to try to find the information with the chat bot?

> P10: Well, you can. It says ask this, you know, like I'm, I'm doing doing it now just to it tells you what you can use the chat bot for, right? It tells you, OK, what are, you know, And it's like, so the things that it comes out with, I'm saying, OK, I don't want any of that kind of stuff.

> P10: I, what I want is something different. So that's, you know, so I, I, I would like it if they just, you know, I don't know, trying to think of the, the right words to say.

> P10: I I guess just to be when, when a chat bot usually opens up, you usually just can type stuff in.

> P10: So some of the stuff that they say you this is what you know, it's kind of misleading. I'm used to a chat bot, you know, opening up and then you just start typing what you want.

> P10: OK, you know, because when you know some of the stuff that they say to get you started, try entering questions like blood, you know, where is my decision letter or where is, you know, like that's not, you know, I just need, I need to find out where I can get a, a letter that has nothing to do with anything on here.

> P10: I need, I need, I need a number and and it's not good with that.

Becky: Yeah. I'm curious, do you usually contact the VA or do you usually try to find answers through chat bot or do you?

> P10: No, I went out. I was trying to find a number and I'm trying to remember what I was trying to get. It was a number I was trying to get. Oh boy.
 
> P10: I was trying to make a, I don't know if it was for Tri West or something. I I was trying to get a, a number to and the person I spoke to told me to call this number and the number she she gave me was, was a was a, I hit a dip.

> P10: You know, it was just it was, it was a bad number. Basically she gave me a bad number.

> P10: So I went to va.gov to and they give you like a, a toll free number and their toll free number was not good either. So I said, what am I gonna do now?

> P10:

> P10:

> P10: So I went to va.gov to and they give you like a, a toll free number and their toll free number was not good either. So I said, what am I gonna do now?

> P10: Because I'm trying to to reach someone and I'm. I wish I could remember what it was for now. Can't remember what it was for. Maybe it'll come to me as we.

Becky: Yeah. Maybe, you know going through through the page later in our session will will spark some memories. But that. That's totally fine. I think I I get the gist that you're, you know trying to find this number and it was it was difficult in that situation. Then maybe use the chat bot.

> P10: Yeah. That was that was futile. But I, it was like I, I, I received a call and the thing of it was, it seems like it just happened. Let me see if I see if I can bring up it.

> P10: It just, it was just recently just happened recently where I'm just trying to see if, if, if I can. Seems like it was just last week where I was trying to call a toll free number and I had been called and they told me, I'm sorry, we, we cannot put you through you on this number. And so they gave your number and the number they gave me was wrong.

> P10: And so, so I said, well, let me go out to ba.gov to see if I can get a number there. And and so I called the number thatva.gov and that number was wrong too.

Becky: OK. Yeah. I'm sorry you had to go through so many numbers for for one thing.

> P10: Yeah. I wish I could remember exactly what it was all about.

Becky: Yeah, Yeah. And it it's not a problem if you if you can't remember too and just wanted to say too, we have actually one more observer that might join us if that's still fine with you. She just had to come out of the meeting.

[Observer joins.]

Becky: And Stephanie, I just want to ask you one last question before we dive into the two scenarios, which I'll give you. But what information do you usually expect on a contact us page?

> P10: On a contact us, I usually expect an e-mail address, OK, a phone number where you can do, where you can call customer service and you know, and chat.

> P10: So usually some way to also, you know, maybe where you can get departments, departmental information. Yeah, sometimes, like I said, you know, a lot of things have been switched over from the E benefits.

> P10: I used to be able to go to E benefits and now they're saying you gotta go to va.gov to get that information. And I'm like, OK, well that's fine, but is it gonna be easy to find that information?

> P10: And that that's not always the case. So sometimes I, I, I like, I would like it if some I could call someone and they can walk me through something.

Becky: Yeah, yeah, that that makes sense. And I can see how if you're used to doing one thing, it might be difficult in certain scenarios to start using something else.

Becky: But thank you for giving me all that information and sort of walking through your experience there.

> P10: Yeah. Last week I had an issue. It was crazy. I would because when I normally, when I when I want to just go out to I, I use My HealtheVet to log on. Well, last week it was not allowing me to do that.

> P10: Normally I just go out and just click on login 'cause my stuff is already there. Could not do it. So I said I'm gonna have to use one of the alternate sites. You know, they have alternate sites like ID dot me, they have DS Logon. And so sometimes you can log into those.

> P10: So I said, well, let me try DS Logon because that's usually a one stop shop. You can get into everything through there.

> P10: OK, It was crazy because I get into there. I, I, I'm logging, I log in, but they won't let me go any further because they say my password has expired.

> P10: OK, so now I'm trying to put in passwords and it's telling me every time I put in a, a new password, it will not accept it.

> P10: And I'm like, well, who can I contact? I said I know va.gov. No, when you get, when you call that number on va.gov, you get run around.

> P10: So you don't get, they usually just transfer you to someone, someone else, you know, got it.

Becky: Yeah, yeah. And and I think one of the scenarios we'll go through will be might be familiar to you since it's a, a login scenario.

[P10 starts screen sharing]

## Scenarios
Becky: But yeah, next I'll I'll give you 2 scenarios where you as a veteran would reach out to VA for help. And these scenarios are actually real questions that veterans have asked us this year. They've just been reworded.

Becky: So before we do that, I will send you a link to our current contact us page on va.gov.

### Login scenario
Becky: And I'll explain the first scenario. So I'd like you to pretend that you're a veteran who can't create an account on va.gov right now.

Becky: So what you're trying to do is you're trying to create a login.gov account, but login.gov doesn't let you use your passport to verify your ID, your I to as a form of identification. And you don't have your driver's license because you lost it recently.

Becky: So all you have is a passport and login.gov isn't accepting that. So starting on this page, show me how you would find help for this scenario. And as you're showing me, tell me what you're thinking and noticing on this page too.

Becky: All right. And I see you're just scrolling down the page. Do you mind me asking what you might, what you're trying to look for right now?

> P10: You said login.gov, and I was just looking to see if there was a link for login.gov.

Becky: OK, OK.

> P10: So helpful online to change your address on file VA changer. So nothing.

Becky: Yeah. And and just pausing there. Why did you choose helpful online tools rather than the other options up there?

> P10: OK, well, it's because it's online. I thought, OK, so contact us online, ask VA. OK, well, let's see that.

> P10: So I'm, I'm used to usually if there were a login, like when I go to My HealtheVet, there is all these sites on the site.

> P10: Have you ever been to My HealtheVet?

Becky: Yeah, yeah. On that website. 

> P10: When you go to that website, it gives you all these alternative sites. And I was thinking, I was wondering, does that is that something that that you have here? No.

Becky: OK. So you'd be looking for links to maybe other sites that could give you more help specifically around login.gov maybe .

> P10: Yeah, like a like a, I mean if you if you go out to like, when I'm when I'm when I go to login to My Healthe Vet. Like I said, they have all these alternative sites. They have ID dot me, you know all the sites and they have DSO dot login on this.

> P10: You know, there's a place where you can go if you Scroll down or something like that, you see them. I don't see anything like that here.

> P10: So that's one of the reasons I was scrolling down to see if you had some other, you know, other links to get me to login.gov.

Becky: OK, yeah, thank. Thanks for explaining that. And it's really helpful to see, you know, you gravitated towards the two links that had online in the title because you thought, OK, maybe these these links can help me. And, you know, you clicked on both of them.

Becky: I see you scroll back up to the top. So what would you do now if you read things and you weren't sure quite how to proceed?

> P10: I would go to I would go to MyHealtheVet.

Becky: OK, OK.

[P10 types in MHV site in address bar, waits for autofill.]

Becky: Yeah. And and tell me what you would do next.

> P10: OK, so here is my healthy, but I'm going to hit sign in and then it has all these places where I can sign in and, you know, choose a secure login partner option 3.
 
> P10: And there, there goes a lot. And there it is right there. That's what I was telling you.
 
> P10: See how you my healthy bet login.gov ID dot me so that's what I was, you know, choose a secure site is that, is did I miss that where I was before?

Becky: Yeah yeah, I think I'll I'll walk through the scenario one more time.

Becky: It's the problem is you, you can't sign into, you can't create an account on login.gov right now because yeah

> P10: OK, so, OK, so let me go back and click on that link again in in the chat just in case I missed it, because yeah.

Becky: And again, it's you can't create an account on login.gov because you only have your passport to verify your identity. And so login.gov doesn't accept that.

> P10: So what I want to do is to find another secure site domain, OK? And so where is there other secure sites like I could find at the other place?

> P10: So that's the first thing that that's what I would in my mind, I'm thinking, OK, if I can't get in to this one, maybe I can get in doing something else. So now I'm gonna go to so I'm gonna look for alternate sign insurance.

Becky: OK.

> P10: And so that's the thing that I was telling you that My HealtheVet has. It has other secure, you know, so when I went back to my healthy vet and hit the sign in and you go down and it says choose a secure sign in partner, choose a secure. So now I have other options.

> P10: Since I can't use login.gov, more than likely what I'm going to do is to sign in with DS dot logon because this is like a one stop shop.

Becky: Yeah. And what from your past experience makes you think it's a one stop shop? I'm, I'm curious since I haven't heard that before.

> P10: OK, well, let me see if I can. Let me see if I can log because once you do, once you log in, it will tell you when you get there. Let me see if I can do that.

> P10: You must have logged off. OK, let me see. So normally it will tell you all of the different sites and this one, this time it doesn't.

> P10: Not on. Not on this page, but normally let me see let me let me stop sharing for a minute and go back to my other Yeah, and maybe I'll I'll throw a because it'll tell you it will it will tell you all of the sites that it's so let me sure again.
 
> P10: OK, so sign in and do DS dot log on. Can you can you see?

Becky: Yeah, yeah, I can see this right now. I might, I might stop you there and add another part to our scenario.

> P10: So what I what I what I what I was trying to get to was was this this site when you get to it, it tells you all of the sites that it that it allows you to you're being direct.

> P10: Yeah, yeah.

Becky: Yeah, yeah. And I think I know what you're talking about.

> P10: It may not, it may not accept because it probably recognizes that I've got something that's going on. But it it has a list of all of the sites that you know that you will that you can that once you log into DS log on, you now can get into this site, this site, this site.

> P10: So it's like a you know, it, you can, you can get it. Let let me see for a minute. If I you, you unless you don't need it.

> P10: I was just gonna show you 'cause when you get when you log into it, it tells you how we we get you through ebenefits.va.gov. My healthy E vet ID dot me. It just goes the gamut of the different federal sites that it helps you get through.

Becky: Yeah, yeah. And I don't think you have to show me since I am, I see the screen in my head right now. I think I know what you're talking about where it gives you those or it shows you those different options.

Becky: But no, it's still helpful to see and hear sort of why you would choose DS log on 1st as an alternative. Yeah, Yeah.

> P10: That's why I would do that.

[P10 leaves for a few minutes and comes back.]

### Claims scenario
Becky: I'll, I'll walk through our second scenario for you right now. So again, you can just you can share your screen after I talk through the scenario too, just on the contact us page.

Becky: But in the scenario, you're a veteran and you currently get disability compensation for some shoulder pain. And you notice that your shoulder has been hurting more in the past couple of months, but you aren't sure if you can request more compensation for your shoulder pain because it's worse now.

Becky: So that's what you're trying to find out if you can request more compensation for worsening shoulder pain. So starting on the contact us page, show me how you'd find help for this new scenario.

Becky: And as again, as before, as you're showing me, tell me what we're thinking and noticing too. And you might have to share your screen again, since I don't see it right now.

[P10 shares screen again.]

> P10: So what I want to do basically is to see if I can upgrade my compensation.

Becky: Yes. Because you aren't sure if you can.

> P10: Yeah. So, so I Scroll down here to see check your VA claim or appeal its status. So that's the first thing I wanna do is is to find out how or you know, how can I, let's see check your VA direct deposit how schedule maintenance.

> P10: So it looks like I want that sounds like I wanna put in a new claim. And in my case, I I would more than likely try to find the the first person who I went through would probably like did I go through DAV If I went to DAV, I would probably try to find who could I go to, which is what most people would will try to do.

> P10: Is it like when you So if I have if I have compensation and pension already, who was the person who got me that compensation and pension?

Becky: OK. So yeah. And I see what what did you just click on there?

> P10: Resources and support.

Becky: OK. And and what do you think that means or what does that mean to you?

> P10: Well, it's a resource. So that means that more than likely I'll be able to find a resource which is what I'm looking for is a resource that will help me.

> P10: So here we have here disability non compensable disability combat related special. So that intend to file a claim.

> P10: So that's what I'm gonna do is that I wanna be, I wanna file a new claim and this will tell me find out how to notify use of intent to file a claim for via disability pension or so I'm gonna read this here, submit an intent to file online.

[P10 goes to Your intent to file a VA claim article.]

> P10: And that's, so that's where I that's where I would start right here. Submit an intent to file online.

Becky: Yeah, yeah. And pausing there. What do you think an intent to file is? Oh, sorry. What do you think an intent to file is? Or why do you think this is the the right method to to go down or the right path to go down?

> P10: Well, this is this gets the this gets the ball rolling. This is, you know, this is this, this is going to be a like the stamp date. So when they get the actual, this will be this gets the clock going.

> P10: In other words, so the so the date that you complete this and put it in they when they when they go back, if they have to pay you retroactive, they'll pay you back from the date that you submitted an intent to file.

Becky: Got it. OK. And do you know this just based on your past experience or what you just read here?

> P10: Past experience.

Becky: OK, gotcha. So that makes a little bit more sense to me. So you're you're thinking about your past experience and you're thinking, OK, I need to do this as a first step maybe for for the scenario.

> P10: Yeah, Yeah.

Becky: And just for the sake of the scenario, let's say, you know, you fill out this form and you know, it's not quite the, it doesn't quite give you the right answer that you need. What would you do in in that case?

> P10: Well, I would probably want to find someone that could help me.

Becky: OK, yeah, I know you mentioned getting back in touch with the original person who approved your claim. How would you do that?

> P10: Let's see if they have a, I would search bar see what comes in.

Becky: OK, so you're using the search.

> P10: Let's see what can and how many. Well is that showing 10 one to 10? OK, so the disability compensation, current veterans, you know, change your debt dependence service, disabled life insurance for your survivors.

> P10: I'll file a disability claim. Wow, got quite a few current MM.

Becky: OK, you see, you're adding more words to the search. OK, now you're putting in.

> P10: Let me see if yes, let's see DAV.

[P10 types in 'DAV and phone number']

> P10: OK, there we go. DAV the DAV Mod. OK, so then I have to put.

Becky: All right, so now you're, is it that you're wanting to find a phone number now for a local area?

> P10: Yeah, I wanna see, I wanna get. So DD transport the disabled veterans organization, so maybe they could help me out. I I what I wanted to get was the actual number for the disabled vets.

Becky: Yeah. And why does this organization or the Disabled American Veterans come to mind for you?

> P10: Because they actually were the ones that helped me with my.

Becky: Oh, OK, Got it. Yeah. And what are you seeing on this page right now? Is it helpful right now or?

> P10: No. [On DAV vans: Transportation for Veterans]

> P10: No, I'm just, you know, transportation to appointments. Nothing like no, Yeah. So this is not, you know, at this point here, I would just, I would just leave. I wouldn't even.

> P10: Is it I, I expect better than this. I mean, I probably at this point I'm thinking, OK, it's time to use Google because if I do this and search, search Bing.

> P10: So this is what I'm, I'm gonna get more help. If I go here, see what I see what I just got when I did that. So it, you know, I'm done with va.gov already. I'm like, OK, you can't help me, but I can Google or Bing and probably get more help.

> P10: So here the I Googled and this takes me right to the site. So. So that's terrible.

Becky: Got it. Yeah, I see. You know, Bing pulled up your search result right there. So you were maybe just looking for that specific website, but you weren't finding it in the search results, right.

> P10: So why you know, that's and that's the thing with with va.gov. I mean, why it it's all over the place?

> P10: I don't understand the, you know, the use of it something, you know, what is it? What is it for? It seems like, and I imagine some people would need this, this, this, but it's like it's all over the place.

> P10: So, you know, it seems like maybe there's a certain keyword that you have to know in order to get. Let me see if I put in DAV website, what comes up. No.What about and service?

> P10: No, yeah. So this, this is not the place to come to if you need help.

Becky: Got it. Yeah, yeah. No, you've, you know, you showed me how the process can be difficult, especially, you know, starting on the contact us page. Then you you've used search, you've clicked around and still haven't found what you're looking for.

Becky: So it's clear that you know you would go to maybe Google or Bing to try to find what you're looking for. 

> P10:  And let's see if I put help with help with the disability claim.

> P10: Let's see what I do here. Hopefully this see what kind of upload evidence to support your deed, how to follow a disability claim. So your intent to follow is playing beer.

> P10: OK, let me say see if I put customer service help because I don't want to do it myself.

Becky: Right right. You're looking for someone else

> P10: And it's you know, so let's see what this says. This may come OK, find, learn about eligibility, learn about fully learning goals. I need to whatever it is, do I need.

[P10 goes to How to file a disability claim.]

> P10: So this is not you can file a claim and file for this online, online by mail, in person, by fax with the help of OK, here we go with the help of a trained professional.

> P10: Option five OK, so getting help following the claim.

[P10 selected Get help from a VA accredited representative or VSO.]

Becky: OK, so now they have oh, then what are you looking for right now?

> P10: As you're so so I want a VSO. I want I want the phone number of a VSO. So get help from.So here's what it tells you on this page.

> P10: Types of of accredited fine and accredited a point in the credit how to contact us if you have questions OK find an accredited representative OK let's see what that is and that seems to be OK so so you just clicked on that yeah so.

[P10 is on Find a VA accredited representative or VSO site. Skips to the bottom to the phone number.]

> P10: And there is the same number, Yeah.

Becky: Do you feel like going through these steps that you found maybe an answer or someone to help at at this point or no?

> P10: OK, so let me, well, let's let's compare. OK, 'cause so like what I did before when I, you know, went up to search and I said this enabled and what I, what did I do?

> P10: Click here and hit search and let me write to the DAV.

Becky: Got it. Yeah, 'cause you're looking for the DAB.

> P10: Uh huh. SO now...

Becky: It looks like you landed on a page for or. What do you see on the page?

> P10: OK, so join us to get to know how we have contact your local DAB office. That's what I want.
 
> P10: OK, fine DV. So this is what I want and got it now I put in my zip code and that's what I want right there. That's that's basically what I wanted to get.

> P10: I wanted a number of a person that's that can help me and it tells you here assisting veterans and following clinics with the Department of Veteran Affairs for compensation. [Similar tool on DAV to the facility locator tool on VA.gov]

> P10: That's it.

Becky: Great. Yeah. You know, even though you did not find your answer on va.gov, I think just seeing the whole like how you would go through this process, use Bing to find the answer on another website really helps us understand what maybe our our page is missing right now.

> P10: Yeah. So let me see here, if I just, if I keep going here, you know, sometimes I'll click on something just to see how close it will get me to what I need.

Becky: And yeah, I see you're in the the bottom section now.

> P10: Uh huh. Get help from uncredited. And this is to me, this is what I call a run around.

Becky: OK.

> P10: It's like when you want help, you don't want all of this stuff here, especially if you know partially what you want.

> P10: Maybe you know, you know, you know that you spoke to someone. Maybe you can't remember. You're trying to jog your memory and it's taking you through all of this.

> P10: Get help. Fall in Department of Veteran Affairs intake. So no phone number, just just a PO box in Wisconsin, right? OK, so this this just seems like, you know, it seems like they put something up there just to have something up there.
 
> P10: So I'm in I'm in [location]. I've got only a PO box number. I don't have a phone number, you know, because of just to make sure that this is still up to date information. You know, phone numbers and even emails work better than a PO Box.

> P10: That's really, that's when I see APO Box that, that just tells me that they put something up there just to have something up there that was just, that's like a placeholder.

> P10: And you gotta do better than that.

Becky: No, I'm definitely, you know, taking notes on what, what you're doing and you know, the information you're encountering. And I, I do agree, just seeing APO box would be very unhelpful in this situation.

Becky: So, yeah, thanks for thanks for walking me through that. And I think just for the, the sake of time, we'll skip down to maybe doing a little bit of reflection just on what we, everything we went through. So if it's helpful, you can keep your screen up.

## Review each scenario
[BP skipped this section for time.]

## Cool down
Becky: But yeah, I wanted to ask, what did you think of using the contact us page in those scenarios?

Becky: So the first one being you can't create an account using login.gov with only a passport. And the second one being, you want to know if you can increase your compensation for worsening shoulder pain.

Becky: Is there anything you liked about the contact us page or anything that could have been easier from your mind?

> P10: Well, for one, you know, there's I, I look for workarounds, OK, There was no workarounds.

> P10: So knowing what I do know that there, you know, if login.gov is telling me one thing, I do know that there's another site that may give me the same thing that login.gov, you know, it's like, it's like like the DSO.

> P10: So that's what I'm gonna go to because DSO will probably help me. So, you know, now if, if it's only so sometimes DSO will even get me once I can get into DSODSO will put me into login.gov because DSO has this authentication thing that I have to go through.

> P10: And after you authenticate through DSO, it's like you that you passed because it's you know, and so I noticed that after I passed the DSO, it will let me into other sites that I could not get into before.

Becky: Okay, that makes a lot of sense regarding the...

> P10: Because DSO uses your phone number, it uses your e-mail. So it's gonna send me a one time passcode and I have to put that passcode back in and it'll may, it may do that twice it don't you know. So it's got like A2 authentication factor.

Becky: Got it. Yeah. The what's it called? Multi factor authentication.

> P10: So, so once I pass that multi factor authentication, I'm in and now it when I click on login.gov, I'm I'm immediately put through.

Becky: Got it. Is there anything else that could have that you think could have been easier on the Contact Us page from the start? Anything that you felt was missing or could have been changed from the contact for the contact us page on the page that we initially looked at so well?

> P10: Well, of course, like I said, the, the partner resources, so #1 and just just to have, you know, I'm trying to think of it a phone number for tech support.

Becky: Oh, OK.

> P10: Because that, you know, like that's what I was saying the other day I was having difficulty with the DS login site and the, and the difficulty stemmed from the password.

> P10: It was not accepting, you know, I was there for one hour trying to log in because he was not accepting passwords. And I'm like, I'm still, you know, I'm not even aware that how the time did not look.

> P10: I'm like, Oh my goodness, I've been here on this site for one hour trying to get a password that it will cause now it's up to they've really made it hard to they, it used to be you could do, you could keep the same password that you used before and just add a one to it.

> P10: Not anymore. Now it wants, it says at least 8 characters have to. So I'm like OK, I've got 8 characters now why are you not accepting and at least 8 characters have to be different now And that's it was stuck on that and it turns out I was right.

> P10: I had eight, at least 8 characters different, but the website, but the website was not refreshing. And finally it refreshed and accepted.

Becky: Got it. Yeah. I can imagine how that can be so frustrating for especially an hour just because of the the website not refreshing.

> P10: So that's the point when you call tech support and you say, so you call tech support and you say, I don't, you know, nothing I'm doing is correct. And I, I used to, I used to work tech support for people who couldn't get passwords in and they were like, they would call me and they say I'm, I'm locked out of my account.

Becky: Got it. So you have a lot of experience there. And I noticed you are, you know, you're pretty resourceful or you start with trying to find answers. But then I, I hear you're saying, you know, if you can't figure it out yourself, then you will contact someone.

> P10: You need to have a tech support because the you get locked out and sometimes you just don't have time to, you know, so tech support can do an override and, and, and get you get you in.

> P10: They can tell you what you why it wasn't doing. And sometimes it's not the customer's fault as as it was in this case, I was putting in the correct passwords, but it was not accepting them because it it it wasn't, but it wasn't refreshing.

> P10: It was still, it was still on the old passwords. And so once I hit the refresh button, it said, oh, look at that. It accepted it.

Becky: Yeah. Well, I'm, I'm glad you figured it out. At the end of that long process.

Becky: I do see we're at time too. So I wanna be respectful of your time if you do you have any final questions for me or is there anything else that you want to share with me about this, this research process? Like I know the phone call was helpful. Is there anything else you wanted to share or any other questions you have?

> P10: Yeah, take that post office box. I don't, you know, that really just smacks of of placeholder. I'm like, I'm why is that there? You know, is it because it's a government site? Is it is it there for protection? Why aren't, you know, and but you know, I've come to, I expect that from from government sites.

> P10: I I don't, I think that's one of the reasons why I rarely, there's not a lot of trust in government websites because of things like that, that it's like they someone told somebody to put up a website and then it's done.

> P10: And you don't really, I don't find them that that helpful.

Becky: Yeah, yeah, I definitely hear you on that with the address.

> P10: I, I wonder why is that right? Do you know why that is?

> P10: Well, with this particular one, I'm not asking you to address all government websites, but just with this particular one, can you tell me why they have a post office box?

Becky: Yeah, I, I think the, I think what might have been happening was like on that page in particular, there were different sections like contact us by X, contact us by phone, contact us by mailing address.

Becky: And you were looking under that section, but that section was the only one that had accordions or that had that button that you could press that would show the address.

Becky: So I think like because that was so prominent, that's why you might have been drawn to that section.

Becky: But what was in smaller text was the different contact options. It was just less easy to see.

> P10: OK, Yeah. All right, then that's all I have.
