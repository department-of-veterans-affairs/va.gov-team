## Before showing ‚ÄòContact us‚Äô page
[I have been a Veteran for over 50 years now. 
*Have you used the Contact Us page? -Yes. I used it because I needed to ask a question. You can ask the Chatbot a question. I needed to know where some documents were. I used to be able to go to E-benefits, but things have moved around. Not able to use Chatbot to help what I was looking for. The things that came out of Chatbot were not what I was looking for.
Do you try to get answers through Chatbot? No, I was trying to get a number for something. The person I spoke to told me to call this number and it was a bad number.
I expect an email address, and phone number where to call customer service. Maybe where you can get departmental information. 
Normally I use My Healthy Vet log on and I couldn‚Äôt so I used the alternate and I used DS logon and I couldn‚Äôt access it because every time I put a new password, it won't accept it. I called the number on VA.gov and that did not work, they just transfer you somewhere else.]

## Scenarios
### Login scenario
[Looking to see if there is a link to login.gov.
*Why did you choose helpful online tools? Because it‚Äôs online. I‚Äôm used to usually seeing all these alternative sites and I was wondering if they had that here. 
*What would you do next? -I would go to My HealtheVet. ]
### Claims scenario
[I would scroll down here and click, check your VA claim or appeal status. I would like to go back to the person that originally got me. I would click on resources and support. I‚Äôm looking for a resource that will help me. Here in disability, click on ‚Äúintent to file a new claim‚Äù. Click, ‚Äúintent and submit to file‚Äù
Search and type DAV and phone numbers, What I wanted to get was the actual number for disabled Vets. Because they were the ones that initially helped me. 
*Is this page helpful? -No. At this point, I would just leave and search Google/Bing. I would get more help if I go here. I‚Äôm done with VA.gov. I don‚Äôt understand the use of it, its‚Äô all over the place (search button).
Now, I‚Äôm the VSO page. I want the number of a VSO. 
*Do you feel like going through those steps helped you? -No ( Now the participant is in the DAV website) This is what I call the runaround. You just want the answer right there.]
## Review each scenario
[I look for workarounds. Knowing what I do know, Login.gov tells me one thing, and looking at another site will tell me another and DSO will put me into Login.gov because of the authentication thing. I noticed that once I pass the DSO, it will get me into sights that I couldn‚Äôt before.
TIME OVER.]
