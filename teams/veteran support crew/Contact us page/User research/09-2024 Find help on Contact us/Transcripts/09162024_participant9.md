## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
[Veteran 30 years ago this month. 
*Have you used Contact Us? -Yes, two years ago. When they went to the logon. Com I was on a test for that but after the session, that login has not worked. I still have not been able to get it to work. 
I clicked on the link on the website. I tried to go first on reset my ID but there were too many steps and I called and they were supposed to send me a link but I still have not heard back.
I tried to do email or any method. The phone is a last resort. I’m not an area where cellphones is not the best. To me, a phone call is a last resort. The people I talk to do, don’t always know. 
Yes. Through the website or help page. 
Finding out, I received a benefits letter. I kept typing in on the search button on the VA website and didn’t work and I googled the exact words on google and it led me to the exact page I needed.
I went to the home page, my information page.]

## Scenarios
### Login scenario
[A lot more links than I would expect, which is good. I would click on the Check your VA claim or appeal. I would log in and, looking for questions on claims or benefits that shows what I would do next like on the FAQ’s page and see where I can get additional assistance. 
Without logging in, I’m at a standstill because I can’t log on. I might click “What your claim status means”. There is another link there taking me back to check your claim status. My first page, and FAQ’s from the top of my head, I thought that would be where I can find what I’m looking for.
*Why would you go to a VA Regional office vs the phone number there? -I would try to find the Regional number because the National might take me to another number instead of the Regional, which might help me find a local number. 
I don’t have a VA hospital near me, and the VA is horrible for travel claims. They refuse to give me a letter, instead, I get a travel denial letter when they are the ones that make the appointment. I have a lot of problems with dealing with any support from the VA. 
I would choose VA health, it’s not really clear, but it’s not urgent, emergency, it’s not community providers, then I would do a search, and of course, no area is found. I don’t see I have an option where I can expand the area, like 50 mile radius but I do see a map. I’m trying to click on the one result, but I can’t do anything with it even if I click on it. Now, I go to view listing but it should of taken me automatically. Great, I have the address and main number. I would call the main number and see if I can get an appointment for my shoulder.]
### Claims scenario
[Again FAQ’s to see if that would give me a closer look. Second, click, Contact us Online through VA. I’m assuming there's some sort of chat functionality and I would get a number to the right facility. I could do the Chatbot and they may give me a live person. 
I would do the FAQs first. Then Contact Us online.
We will try the Chatbot next, I see there an area it says, things Chatbot cannot do the following. I can’t sign in and I would start my message without signing in. I’m trying to click on the box to see if I can sign in and nothing is happening. I selected the question mark which I should do, I should be able to type it. Sign in and technical issues, question mark, I’m going to click on sign in.
I would do the call if this page didn’t work. I don’t like this on this page that I have to click on something and drop down that is not very clear. 
I would do the call us. I would do the VA help desk, it might help me with that. I would choose the 411 number.]

## Review each scenario
[Why is everything a drop-down except for that one, and that is very confusing, can’t do anything.
A phone call or text messaging is frustrating because I don’t have the best service and that is a limiting factor and I would not be able to get help because, through multifactor authentication, I don’t have the best cell service. I have to use my ID.me for almost everything. I’m stuck with it for now.]

## Cool down
[Map page, and putting my issues didn’t work. For the most part, it did have options and answers but not for everything. Search bars on everything would be great.]
