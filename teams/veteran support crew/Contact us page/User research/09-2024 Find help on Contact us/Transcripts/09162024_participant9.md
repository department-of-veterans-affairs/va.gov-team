## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
Becky: Well, it seems like we're ready to get started and first, we're just gonna take some time to learn more about your experience with VA and VA customer support. So starting off around how long have you been a veteran?

> P9: We're technically a veteran with when I joined, so [number] years ago this month.

Becky: Wow. OK, Happy happy anniversary. That's quite a long time. In that time, have you ever used the contact us page on va.gov?

> P9: Yes, I want to say two years ago was the last time I did when they went to the new I think it was log on dot, log on dot, ID whatever was called the new format.

> P9: I was part of a test part for that to do, trying to work on it and to get the ID, ID to work.

> P9: But it after the session it didn't work. And then I kept trying to contact the VA through Contact us and then try to get that that log in to work again and I still haven't gotten it to work right since.

> P9: So I have to use other logins other than the new version of it that they have.

Becky: Oh, interesting. OK. How did you try to contact the VA in that instance?

> P9: So I clicked on the link on the website and then 'cause I tried to do first, you know, reset your IP, you know, getting a new password and everything else, trying to go through the process, but it's got so many Dang steps.

> P9: It kept timing out and then it kept screened up. So I finally got it to try to get a phone call. So I finally got a phone call with them to try to work on it.

> P9: They said they're supposed to give me a call back and they sent me a link, but it didn't work. So I just like, it's just not worth it, worth an hour of the time.

> P9: I was, I just was waiting for the glitches to stop. Hopefully one day it would work better so I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore. But still not that.

Becky: Yeah, sorry to hear about that. I know, you know, we definitely hear a lot about login issues with our veterans too, you know, even depending on if they live overseas or if they're here, that sort of thing.

Becky: I'm curious too. So you mentioned you contacted VA by phone. Is that how you usually contact VA by calling or like, do you try to do e-mail or do you have a preference?

> P9: I try to do e-mail. I try to do or anything or whichever method e-mail or like the chat if it was available, but phone's kind of last resort just cause it's, it's a hit or miss and you never know.

> P9: And I'm, I'm not in an area where the cell phone signal is the best, which is part of the problem too.

> P9: So it's always an issue, especially if you have to worry about receiving a code to your phone, stuff like that, that's always a pain.

> P9: So it just, it's just, it's a hassle. So to me, a phone, a phone call's almost a last resort.

Becky: OK, Can you explain, I guess you talked about, you know, your, your cell phone signal. Is there any other reason why it might be a last resort for you?

> P9: 'cause the people I talk to don't always necessarily know what's going on. And again, without having the best signal, it's hard to hear them. And then constantly repeat for everything else. It's just more of a hassle than than it's worth. 
 
Becky: Yeah, yes. I'm wondering do you try to find answers online first? 

> P9: Yes.

Becky: OK, how do you do that?

> P9: So if I can't find it on the website itself to the help page or I'll go to Google and then type it in there or try to find other like some of the forums I'm part of just to see if if anything, if anybody else having the same issue or how do they way to fix it.

> P9: I try I might put the question out there if it's, you know, really troublesome, but again, we don't always get quick answers there either.

> P9: So I don't really have a quick way to get anything done just because of the fact of where I live, but it is what it is.

Becky: Got it. I'm curious, can you maybe walk me through like your most recent attempt at finding answers online and, and how that went with VA or like Ava related question.

> P9: So actually we end up being, finding out what my, actually I had to get, actually last week I had to get a benefits letter to show because my my VA benefits have been updated. So I wanted to get a letter for it.

> P9: But I kept typing in for the search function on my health, the vet or my Hilda vet, whatever it is. And then on the main VA page, it wouldn't work.

> P9: So I finally had to go to Google, type in the exact same words. And gosh, it took me right to the V as link right there.

> P9: But for some reason the VA itself, the VA.gov or the My HealtheVet would not let me find that page. That's really that was very frustrating.
 
Becky: Got it. So it sounds like you are trying to use this, that search tool, but you just had to use the Google search tool which brought you to the same page anyway?

> P9: Yes, 'cause it wouldn't let me. I couldn't find it under my own, like under myself, I couldn't find claims, I couldn't find anything where it was would go specifically to those letters that I, I'd only seen the page before.

> P9: So I have, like I said, having to go to to even when I put in the search the exact words, it wouldn't do it. But when I put into Google the exact words, it gave me a link directly right to it.

Becky: Got it. Yeah. That's, that's really frustrating. I know the, the differences between search on a website and just Google search can sometimes be very different and you just end up going to Google anyway.

Becky: Yeah. But it's really helpful to, to hear that. I'm, I'm curious too, when you went to the search on my health event, did you go to like the contact us page first or did you just, you know, search from the home page?

> P9: I went to the home page. I went to my, my information page. I went to like everywhere I could possibly 'cause I'm trying to find it, 'cause I'm like, I know I've been to that page before.

> P9: So I got to say something 'cause I like to know I can get to it without having to really, you know, have to go having to resort to Google to go on a page I'm already at or what should be available readily. And it was not.

> P9: So I tried, I tried both times like My HealtheVet and the VA.gov, just to see if I'm missing something that, you know, 'cause I'm logged into both, it shouldn't be an issue. Why I can't find this Dang thing.

> P9:  And then again, why do I have to go to Google to click on the exact same link that should be available under my profile?

Becky: OK, so that, that clarifies it a bit more. So you're trying to you're looking around different pages or just clicking on different links on the website 1st, and then you had to search and then that didn't work and then you had to do Google search.

> P9: Yes.

Becky: Yeah, that that's a lot of what we'll talk about today too. So I think we can move along to the next part of the session. And first of all, it's been really helpful to learn about your experiences.

## Scenarios
Becky: I think you might find the next scenarios relatable, but next I'll give you 2 scenarios and where you as a veteran, you would reach out to VA for help. And these scenarios are actually real questions that veterans have asked us this year and they've just been reworded.

> P9: OK.

Becky: So before we do that, I will send you a link to our current contact us page on va.gov and they're gonna be in the chat.

[P9 starts screen sharing.]

### Login scenario
Becky: All right, so you're on the contact us page and the scenario is, imagine you're a veteran and you currently get disability compensation for shoulder pain. But you notice your shoulder has been hurting more in the past couple of months and you don't know if you can request more compensation for your shoulder pain because it's worse now.

Becky: So you want to know if you can request more compensation for a worsening existing condition. So starting on this page, show me how you would find help for this scenario. And as you're showing me, tell me what you're thinking and noticing too.

> P9: OK, so actually a lot more questions that I would expect or links, which is good because it and, and so I'm, I'm just going through the entire page.

> P9: Make sure with that thought in mind, of how to to possibly ask for a increase in my shoulder issues.

> P9: So actually explains what each one of these are [scrolling past Ask VA and chatbot], which is good, OK VA benefits hotline.

> P9: I'm still scrolling through, so I guess I would click on the on this page by going through all these, check your VA claim or appeal status just to see and make sure that again, verifying my shoulder as part of it.

> P9: That would probably be my first click, but if you want me to do that click on that one or not.

Becky: Yeah, yeah. Go ahead and click and then tell me what you'd do next.

> P9: I'm sure I'm gonna have to log in. That would be my main thing. Yep.

Becky: OK. And no worries about logging in too. We can, we can stop at that point.

> P9: Right. I gotcha. So no, I would. OK, so I would log in and then go from there because take me to the page I would, would think I would be at, I would need.

Becky: Yeah. And what are you what are you looking for in particular as you're scrolling down this page?

> P9: Well, one one again for questions on this one, either claims or benefits to show what I would need to do next.

> P9: If there's a, like, on that previous page, I have frequently asked questions, which might be one, I might click on to see if I need additional assistance. Or you know, where I could get, you know, submitting a claim like, right there claims [looking at more information section at bottom of claims page], well claims status tool, frequently asked questions, choosing a decision review option, which could be one again, I might click on just to get information on it.

Becky: Yeah. And, and are you finding, finding anything on this page that might be useful or?

> P9: Not necessarily because the fact I would, I probably want to log in and see what it comes up for myself to make sure I can verify my, again, looking for my shoulder status. And then I might look on that page to see if there's an appeal.

> P9: Like, OK, how do I submit an appeal or a request for increase of benefits? See if that was a tab I could click on for that specific issue.

> P9: Or I would, at that point might look for a, is there a link to a veteran service officer or, or something like that to go start the process for a claim?

> P9: So those would be, those are my thoughts in my head for this one. OK, there's a claim decision or appeal type.

Becky: Got it. Yeah, and you listed off a couple of things that so it sounds like you have some experience with this already. So are you're, it sounds like you're going off of your previous experience with benefits and looking for those sorts of keywords.

> P9: Yes. 

> P9: Got it.

> P9: So I don't see without, again, without logging in, I'm, I'm, I'm kind of at a standstill on this page just for myself in my mind, because the fact that again, without having to log in, then could look For more information and then see what you know, go from there.
 
> P9: Possibly the claim status tool frequently asked questions might help us. Either one of those.

> P9: [Clicks on Claim status tool FAQs] I already kind of know what it is 'cause I already had a shoulder injury. It's already been, I've already been seen, let's say 10%. So I already kind of know where I am with that. But it's starting to get worse.

> P9: So now I would need to get looked at, have I already been seen by a doctor to make sure that's already, is there some documentation there searching through my medical records, make sure I have anything that could be assist with that.  

> P9: So I, so I clicked on the claim status tool, frequently asked questions. And then there is the another click link there taking me back to that. Check your claim status.

Becky: And sorry, just pausing here. What made you click on this link versus all the other links on the page?

> P9: So my very first, on the very first page when I first clicked on that, the link that you gave and then frequently asked questions popped in my head as something I should look at to see if it's something I could be assistance.

> P9: So that's why I clicked on that one 'cause that one I thought would might answer what I'm looking for,

Becky: OK.

> P9: And then right here is explaining kind of what you see or what you can find. There's decision letters.
 
> P9: OK, OK, so now there's new evidence which might be part of it. We may have to upload things if they ask for it.

> P9: But again, that according to what, if I understand correctly, what we're doing for this specific part, the claim is already done. I've already got 10% hypothetically, so that I'm now wanting to increase.

> P9: I've already got 10% hypothetically, so that I'm now wanting to increase. I'm trying to start a new claim which I may have to upload evidence on. So it's good to know that that's there.

> P9: So at this point I might do the find a regional VA regional office near you might be my next step just cause the fact I'm not seeing start a new claim on here.

> P9: So I like I said, either find a VSO or make appointment at my local clinic, VA clinic or click on that one for find where my closest regional one.

Becky: Yeah, I'm, I'm curious to, you know, I do see a phone number here and, you know, for the sake of the scenario, I'll ask why, why would you go towards finding a VA regional office versus, you know, calling the phone number there as your next step?

> P9: Because I don't like, you know, 100 numbers are great, but it, it usually puts you to a national line, not a specific area.

> P9: So I would try to find my area, my regional. Like I said, my regional area number would probably be a quicker way to get an appointment than a national, which will probably send me to that same exact place I'm looking for anyway. So trying to cut out the middleman and just go to the my region to make an appointment.

Becky: Got it. OK. And what has your experience been typically with your regional offices?

> P9: Not very good because they're understaffed and they unfortunately had a lot of turnover lately. So they're doing the they're doing the very best they can.

> P9: I have not I don't I'm not complaining about that. It just sucks because we're in a very small area in the middle of nowhere. So getting assistance is very hard.
 
> P9: I rely on community care for almost everything. So I have to I would have to then. OK, call, for me in my area. [Location] is my area. And then they put it to my my part of [location] who then tries to find something local.

> P9: Like right now, I'm waiting six months on a evaluation right now because I can't find anything anywhere close to near me. And I'm we're talking 250 mile radius.

> P9: That's ridiculous that mind you, I do, my choice live in [location], but that's ridiculous that I can't find something that, you know, closer.

> P9: I can't. I don't have a VA hospital anywhere near me. And that I'm like, you know, gripe on this one. A little side sidebar, whatever else want to call it side complaint.

> P9: the VA is horrible about doing travel claims because they refuse to add my location to where I where they sent me to to their list so I can do a travel claim.

> P9: They refuse to tell me when I need additional documentation. They just give me a denial letter where I used to be able to take my exact letter. The exact one they asked me to fill out, take to my my VA to my clinic, give it to them and I get paid within a week.

> P9: Now I have to send it to hire and they disapproved every single thing I submitted and because, well, we don't have that in our system.
 
> P9: You made the appointment. So OK, but I digress. So I just have a lot of problems with dealing any kind of support with the VA.

Becky: No, no, I mean, that's why that's why I'm here to hear and I work with a lot of our other VA teams too that work on these tools or these processes.

Becky: So I'll definitely relay some of this feedback since, you know, it sounds like such a frustrating experience to, you know, not be able to do your travel pay or even find a location around you too. So I'm sorry to hear that.

> P9: Me too. Yeah, especially, Yeah, the VA can't seem to. They'll tell me I can't go to a VA hospital 'cause they can't run an appointment. So they'll give me community care.
 
> P9: They'll give me a facility pretty much near the VA hospital, but cannot. But I cannot find it when I do the travel claim.

> P9: And they will not reimburse me for it because it's through, not even even though the VA made the appointment. So again, there's stupid things that should not be stupid, right?

Becky: No, it's like the the rules don't quite make sense.

> P9: Yes.

Becky: Yeah. Oh I hear that.

> P9: But I do not have, I will say this. I'm not bashing on the VA entirely. They are great about trying to find appointment and make you through and you'll go doing the their due diligence on that.

> P9: It's just the end part is the problem.

Becky: So no, absolutely, which is still part of the the process too, that you have to go.

> P9: But I'm glad that the community care reps I talked to you, all of them are very nice. They're very helpful. They try to be very supportive. So that part I am thankful for. It's just pretty frustrating.

Becky: Yeah, no, I'm glad that you're still getting a good, I guess like a good customer service interaction, I guess with with the actual people that you're talking to.

> P9: I I do not dread calling them. I dread calling the travel people, but that's it.

Becky: Got it. Yeah, I guess like going back to the scenario to let let's say that you, you don't know what office is near you.

Becky: So I'm wondering if you would go ahead and click on find Ava regional office and, you know, try to find your, how would you use this to find your facility that you'd go to?

> P9: OK, so it has the, so it says find VA locations. It's got the use my location facility type, whichever else.

> P9: So I the use my location doesn't always work, but we'll try it facility type that's got VA health, urgent care, urgent care, community providers.

> P9: I'm not just sure what it would actually be considered. I guess VA I'm gonna try VA health and see what happens there and then all the health services.

Becky: Sorry, pausing there quick second, what what made you hesitate a little bit and then LED you to choosing VA health at the end?

> P9: It's not very clear, but I'm, 'cause I'm looking forward to make an appointment for a claim, you know, to be, to get my, nothing on there says regular appointment or I just it's, it's not urgent care.

> P9: I don't need that kind of, you know, that that's I'm not sick or anything else. It's not emergency care community providers.

> P9: It's not necessarily the case because if I was being seen from my shoulder like just for to get that, I would probably look on that the community. Committee provider in the VA's network, I might try on that one.

> P9: But since I'm starting to look at the possible new claim, I would want to go directly to it if I possible at VA facility and not try to add steps to this process.

Becky: OK, yeah, thanks for explaining that.

> P9: Yep. And then I'll do a search.

Becky: All right.

> P9: And of course no areas found. What I don't see is something to expand the area, like, OK, 50 miles, 100 miles, 250 miles, whatever else. I don't have that option so far.

> P9: So I see the view map. So I'm gonna try that and then try to zoom out and see what it says, 'cause right now it's showing me the whole map of the United States. That's not very helpful to me.

> P9: So I get, shouldn't have to do. But then I'm a zoom in to work kind of near my area, OK And where there should be a clinic, there is nothing because I got to do the search the serious let me see.

> P9: OK, so we got two things there. It looks like the [name] and the [name] clinics. So that's good. Someone else zoom in there apparently. Apparently it's not giving me an option to show what's there.

> P9: One option. How do I? So I'm trying to click on the place itself but it doesn't do me any good. It says it shows 1 result but it doesn't show me where that is.

> P9: So I'm gonna try to Scroll down the page again. It it. That's great. It shows me one location but I cannot do anything with it so I'm not saying.

> P9: Right now I'm getting frustrated 'cause I don't understand why if I click on the A which should be the one location it shows. Why is nothing happening?

> P9: All it does is change where the location on the map. So now I'll go to view list again. OK, there we go.

> P9: Now I go back to view list, which should have automatically taken me when I clicked on it, I would think.

> P9: And there's the OK, there's the directions, there's the main number and the mental health number. OK, so that is what I'm looking for.

> P9: That is the place got the address, which is great. And it's got their main number. 

Becky: Great. Yeah. What would you, what would you do with this information?

> P9: Well, at that point, I try to call the main number and see if I can get an appointment for a seeing the my primary care provider and make an appointment for in that for my shoulder to be evaluated to see if it's what further steps have to happen.

> P9: And then let them know that I might be more maybe possibly submit a claim for an adjustment on this one.

> P9: You know, can they look at my past history to it to see where it currently is and then it has it gotten worse and then get evaluation done on that.

> P9: And then if they, that's part of the problem too, gotta understand what the claim process is that they probably want me to go get, let's say extra.

> P9: I'm just being, I'm going down the rabbit hole here. They want to probably get X-rays, MRI, whatever else on that spot. And then I'll spin a claim and they'll want me to get X-rays, MRI, everything else, 'cause they don't want, they're not getting the same thing to be a used.
 
> P9: So again, just constantly adds to this. Then I'll finally see their position or whoever's making that rating and then go from there.

Becky: So, got it. Yeah, I think you explained that, or at least the whole process you'd expect really clearly since, you know, we're not gonna call the main number right now.

Becky: But yeah, very well, I appreciate you going through the whole steps for me. You can go ahead. And if you scroll the way to the top and press the menu button on the upper right, see it? 

Becky: Yeah, go ahead and go back to contact us, and I'll give you our 2nd and final scenario.

### Claims scenario
Becky: All right, so in this scenario, you're still a veteran. And this time you can't create an account on va.gov. What you're trying to do is you're trying to create a login.gov account, but login.gov isn't letting you use your passport as a form of identification and you don't have your driver's license because you actually recently lost it.

Becky: But you still need to make an account with just your passport. So again, starting on this page, show me how you'd find help for the scenario. And as you're showing me, tell me what you're thinking and noticing too.

> P9: OK, so without having my ID and so if my password doesn't work, my thought would be again, frequently asked questions.

> P9: That would be my first thing, just to see if it actually has anything on there to get me a, a more closer look.

> P9: There's nothing quickly that I see that helps me with that specific issue 'cause we're not in the log on page, we're just on the contact us page.

> P9: So otherwise I could do the my second thought would be the Contact us online through the Ask VA and see if they can assist me with that.

> P9: I'm gonna contact. I'm gonna do the contact us online and see what it says.

Becky: OK, And what do you think Contact us online means?

> P9: So I I'm assuming to be a, a chat, some kind of chat functionality and then where somebody would at some point come on there and then I would be able to briefly ask my question and they kind of point me in the right direction of what I would need or support.

> P9: Give me a ticket if it's if they think it's gonna be something more higher reaching or you know, that they can't support would not be able to be fixed quickly or for what they could direct me to.

> P9: OK, I mean, I could try the chat bot and see that, you know, that's something works too because you use a lot of like deal with Amazon.

> P9: You're doing the chat bot chat anyway. And then they may put you with a live person. So I I might try that to see if it helps me out.

Becky: Got it. Yeah, and just pausing here. You mentioned three things that the FA QS contact us online and chat bot. What would be the first thing that you would do?

> P9: Like I said, probably do the the contact us. I'm not sorry the frequently asked questions 'cause that's kind of like let's see what's there 'cause sometimes it might trigger something else.

> P9: But that would be probably my first guess. And then if I didn't find it there, I would probably go to the contact us online.

Becky: OK, do you want to go ahead and go to the FAQs and see see if that would help you.
 
> P9: Let's see, frequently asked questions... OK, Change your address, change your direct deposit, check your blank class or schedule a manage appointment.

> P9: So none of those things are are what I'm looking for right now. OK, so I'm gonna go back the next second, do the contact us online.

> P9: I can try that way or I can try the chat bot. So that would be my next two steps, right?

Becky: Do you wanna try one of those steps out for me?

> P9: Sure, we'll try the chat bot and see what happens. Just cause anybody we're doing testing in about chat. One last question, let's see what it says.

> P9: We're currently in beta testing. OK, reading as it's as it goes Scroll down.

Becky: OK, looking for anything in particular or just trying to see if there's anything useful?

> P9: I'm looking for the disclaimer, especially since it's in beta mode. So I'm trying to make sure there's anything that's saying OK, this may not help you or want I'm just looking to see what it what they say what to expect from using chat bot.

> P9: OK, OK, so, well, I'm, yeah, it's a termination of words. But one thing I first noticed, our chat bot cannot do any of these things. It cannot help you sign in to va.gov.

> P9: So that probably means crap. It's not gonna work. So I would then go back, 'cause it looks like it's not gonna help me. I don't wanna get frustrated where it's something that didn't work.
 
> P9: And then I'd go back and try to do the the online the online chat. OK, You want me to try to click on the chat online?

Becky: Yeah, Yeah, you can click through it. Yeah, if that's something you would do in again in this scenario.

> P9: OK, so create account sign in to start your message. Well, no, I can't do that. That's the whole problem.

> P9: So I would do the start your message without signing in.

Becky: OK.

> P9: And then I don't have a reference number inquiry, so I would start the what happens when I start my message without signing in?

> P9: OK, that has your questions. OK, which category? I'm gonna type in sign in. Let's see what happens here. Maybe. Is it not going to? Why is it not working? It's not showing me.

Becky: Tell me what you're trying to do.

> P9: Right now I'm trying to click on where it says required, like, oh, sorry, what category best describes your question. So I'm clicking on the box to see if I can type in sign in and nothing's happening.

Becky: Got it. And what did you just select there?

> P9: I just selected the question mark, which I shouldn't have to do. I should have you able to type in something I shouldn't have to go, then get frustrated and click on something else.

> P9: It should say click on this first to find what you're looking for.

> P9: OK, So then saying, OK, choose one record and selected to use subject of education, disability compensation, healthcare, veteran affairs, decision reviews, sign, sign in and technical issues.

> P9: OK, that's what I'm gonna click on just like that. All right, then I'm gonna do, I guess.

> P9: Apparently click on the arrow this time the question mark, 'cause I don't know why I have to do that. 

> P9: Let's see. So it's saying either the insurance theva.gov signing in to va.gov and managing your VA profile or technical issues.

> P9: So I'm gonna click on the signing in.

Becky: OK.

> P9: And then what subtopic best describes your question click I clicked on that changing your address, claiming claim status signing in.

> P9: So I'm gonna click on signing. What's what else we got other. So signing in. OK.

Becky: OK. Great. And, and we can pause here since I guess spoiler, this is a, a multi step form, so we don't have to complete the whole form since we're focusing on the contact us page. But I guess pausing here.

Becky: So you know, let let's say you've tried, you've tried three things. The FAQ, you didn't quite find an answer. The chat bot, you didn't want to try because you know, it said it couldn't answer your question. And now, now you've landed on this contact form.

Becky: So let's say you you fill it out and you get an answer and the answer still doesn't really help you with your issue. So what would you do next?
 
> P9: In this case, I would do the call. So I'd go back 'cause this doesn't work. So let me just go back. Yeah, let's go back.

> P9: And I really don't like this on this page where I have to click on something. So I just why do I have a box there where it doesn't say it does do a drop down thing? It's not, it's not very clear. So I just hope that's just my thought, Right.

Becky: Right. I can definitely see the confusion there. Yeah.

> P9: OK, so back to that contacting us there, call us. So I do the the call us.

Becky: All righty. Yeah. And what are you seeing here?

> P9: So it says the main my VA 411 main information line. There's the number to call being an interpreter. That's good.

> P9: OK, VA benefits hotline, GI Bill hotline, national call for some, be a health benefits hotline, My HealtheVet help desk, which possibly I could do.

Becky: Yeah. Yeah. Why do you think that one is could be a potential number?

> P9: Because the fact it still requires a login to in order to get there. So that could be part of the problem or part of the situation or Yeah. So it might help me with that.

> P9: But let's see. I'm still scrolling down.

Becky: Got it.

> P9: There's nothing else. So the only thing would would you click on that?

> P9: What's the number, the 806 three, 86982411 number.

Becky: OK. And why did you choose this number and versus all the other numbers?

> P9: Well, I don't need an interpreter. I don't think I do speak quickly, but I don't think that warrants its own one.
 
> P9: I'm not sure. I don't need a teletype or the telecommunication relay service. VA benefits is not what I'm calling about.

> P9: If it was a va.gov thing, maybe I might choose that, but VA benefits not necessarily what I'm calling about.

> P9: GI Bill hotline, definitely not not for this thing. National call center definitely not VA health benefits is again the same thing, similar to the one above. I'm not sure why you have it twice.

> P9: There's a there's health benefits and then benefits. I guess they're different.

> P9: My HealtheVet help desk and like I said, that's probably the one I would a second option if I didn't you know, but the va.gov covers all

> P9: My HealtheVet is a sub of that, so it makes me think that I would still probably call the main number first.

Becky: OK, yeah, yeah. And I noticed as you're scrolling, you know, you're reading, it sounded like you're reading the the bolded titles more just to to get that information.

> P9: Yes, 'cause that's what sticks out. So that's why I'm trying to narrow down what I need and what that number would help me with.

> P9: So OK, so I'm OK, I don't. So I'm going scrolling through those. OK, None of that's not really sounds like it sounds, does not sound like what I'm trying to do, does not sound like what I'm trying to do So great.

> P9: I scroll over to the bottom [scrolls to the footer], it doesn't have it. They do have to contact us again, link again, but I'm running on the page where that would be helpful, where I think I need to be at.

> P9: So I would then click on that 800 number.

Becky: Great. All right, Well, I think that that explains how you would handle that scenario. We went through a couple of different options and it sounds like, you know, if all else fails, you would call the call phone number, but that would be the last choice some in the scenario for you.

> P9: Yes.

Becky: OK, great. Well, that that does bring us to the end of the scenario. So you can call, you can stop sharing your screen right now and we'll move on to the next section.

[P9 stops sharing screen.]

## Review each scenario
Becky: OK, All right, So thanks for going over the scenarios with me. And, you know, it's it's quite clear that the page isn't very clear right now or, you know, it's just a bit difficult to find information. So while you wait for us to make updates and while we're updating the pages, is it helpful if I show you how some of these contact options would work right now?

> P9: Sure.

Becky: All righty, so let me share my screen and let me know and you can see this, all right?

> P9: OK, Yep, I can see it.

Becky: Great. And I will pull this page over. So what we're gonna do is we'll go over the login scenario, which is the one that we just went over, which is you can't use your passport to verify your identity and you're trying to create a login.gov account.

Becky: So I'll just walk through each of these and then pause for, you know, some of your reactions or any questions you might have.

[Becky reviews each section on Contact us]

### Contact us online through Ask VA
Becky: And yeah, just, I guess just pausing here for just any initial reactions to this option or if you have any questions about what you might expect from this option.

> P9: Almost everything's on there. What I would expect except for again, that very first one, what, which category best describes your, your reading?

> P9: Why is everything else a drop down except for that one 'cause that makes me think I need to type in something by the way that box looks and you can't do anything when you click on it.  

> P9: So that's, that's a very frustrating thing. So to me, the way most websites work, when you see that kind of box, you start typing in a keyword and then you push the, the, the arrow, the, the, a magnifying glass and then it would start showing everything that comes up similar to that thing. So that's an incorrect box in my opinion. And it does not do what it's supposed to be doing.

Becky: Absolutely. Yeah. And we, we are working on updating this tool in particular and moving it over to, to va.gov to, to have this like a similar styling to what else is on there.

Becky: But I do see how it just like when you click on the box, I'm doing this right now. Nothing's happening.

> P9: And then why do you have the boxes below, let's say select, but the top one doesn't? So again, makes you think there's something else that should be there. So that's just my thought.

Becky: Absolutely. No, it is. It's a great thought. As you were doing it. I was like, oh, no, that's not the right one. Like I totally, yeah, I totally got it. All right.

### Ask our chatbot a question
Becky: Do you have any questions or reactions to this option?

> P9: Scroll, scroll up a minute slowly. Where's it at? Yeah, there's something if I Scroll down, but do you want me to scroll up?

> P9: Yeah, scroll up, please. Yes.

Becky: OK. [scrolling up the chat]

> P9: OK, so one thing that's frustrating is exactly right, right there, like a phone call or text message. So if you have one thing I, I really don't like multi factor authentication because it, it's, it's too limiting for those of us that live in an area where we don't get service most of the time I do not have service on my cell phone.

> P9: So I cannot get a phone call or a text. So I can get in my e-mail, but it won't let me do that. It says I need a phone call or text and you can't change it or the number or anything else.

> P9: So that's a very limiting factor that I, I do not like with these multi factor authentication things. So I still wouldn't be able to get help at this point if I was in where I normally am at. I just want to point that out.

> P9: So which could be an issue with this is where you're 'cause you're trying to get your passport and it's not accepting it.

Becky: Yeah, and and I'm curious, how are you or are you able to access your account right now with this multi factor authentication issue or...

> P9: I have to try to go around. I use my, I cannot use login.gov. I have to use my ID dot me for pretty much everything because I don't have ADSI don't have my card anymore, so I can't use AD the DS login.

> P9: So though I just, I'm stuck with ID dot me until I figure what the heck's going on.

Becky: Got it. Yeah, that that's definitely useful to know. And I'll, I'll definitely relay that to our login team since, you know, we've heard some other feedback from veterans during these sessions around logging in. 

Becky: That's why I asked this the scenario because I know, you know, it's a big challenge right now

> P9: And there's way too many steps. That's part of the problem too. And that where you have to with login.gov of going through the process to make sure that you're right, but then it might change in 5 minutes.

> P9: So it's, it's just very, I don't know. I don't, I do personally do not find that a useful alternative. And sure as heck isn't better and sure as heck isn't faster.

Becky: Got it. Yeah, I, I've been through the, the whole verification process too. I understand it is many, many, many steps. Yeah, well, thanks for pointing this out around the two factor authentication though.

Becky: That's why we're, you know, we're talking with veterans from a variety of, of backgrounds or, you know, it sounds like you live in a more rural area, maybe with less service. So that's really helpful to know.

> P9: Yeah, 'cause if you'll like for us, you might have Verizon in the city, but if you're anywhere else, it's like ATT. But well, if you don't have, you're not gonna carry both phones.

> P9: So it's kind of hard to, so you can't do anything with it. So it just gets kind of, and you can't change.

> P9: There's not a if you do have two phones, you can't add 2 phones. So you can't multi multi factor. OK, why don't we use this phone number, not this phone number. So that's just kind of a limiting thing too.

Becky: Absolutely. Yeah, there are there are definitely a lot of limitations, like you mentioned. 

> P9: We are the minority. I definitely agree with that, that you know that there it helps people live in cities or near that, you know, that's great. But for it's just it's not it's not helpful or does not make sense for those of us that live in a more rural area.

Becky: Yeah, absolutely. Like these tools should, you know, work for all folks and include everyone. So yeah, your input's really, really helpful for us to understand that.

Becky: I'll, I'll continue moving us along.

### Call us
Becky: Do you have any reactions or questions to that whole experience with VA411?

> P9: So login.gov, tried to work with the customer service was not helpful. That that did not solve my problem.

> P9: IE dot me always worked, which is great 'cause they told me that was going away. I'm glad I didn't and that's always I've never had an issue with that one.

### Contact your local VA facility

> P9: With my local VA center that's over two hours away. So it doesn't do me any good to go there and go, hey, I need help with my, you know, thing.

> P9: I can't even get a secretary sit there because there's no there is no secretary. So the same people are trying to do everything.

> P9: So and they really they don't have time to they do, but don't have time dealt with that kind of of small thing. So very limiting on the choices there for assistance.

Becky: Yeah, yeah. It really shows how, you know, you really would just have to choose the option that works for you and your scenario on it.

Becky: OK, well, that's the that's for that's what you would expect when you call the phone number contacting your local facility.

[Becky transitions to facility locator tool, since we were already talking about it.]

> P9: I thought I'd be a little bit more intuitive like I like, I did not quite understand the going. I, I didn't like going having to go back and forth between the two tabs without knowing it because like when I clicked on OK, it showed me two facilities.

> P9: I clicked on the map. All it does is change my position on the map. It did not actually tell me that there's another I need to go back to the other tab to see what those are.

> P9: I thought if I put if it shows me the icon for it, that I should be able to click on that. That should give me either direct me back to the tab with the information on it or direct me to, you know, to the contact information for that place.

> P9: That's my only complaint about that one.

Becky: Yeah, no, absolutely that. I definitely flagged that in my mind too. Relate back to our team that when you selected the like the pin, it didn't show you the option. You had to go back to the tab. Yeah, I definitely saw that too.

[Becky reviews conversation with local VA center.]

> P9: OK, so actually then goes back to OK, go go back to your main tab, your contact us tab.

Becky: Yeah.

> P9: So Scroll down. Yeah, right there. Right. Go up, go up, go up right there. So you could click on the My Healthe Vet to as a, as a potential way, possible way to get an answer by, you know, calling that number that 877-327-0022.

> P9: So that could be no other one besides theva.gov on the top there or the my VA 411, right.

Becky: Yeah, that's what the that's what the local Medical Center said.

> P9: Yes, that's good to know. Just curious that I said that before that that that was a possible option for me to pick as the number to call because either way we deal with logins.

> P9: Because I mean, mind you, the va.gov is the main one. That My HealtheVet is a smaller, you know, a lower level of it.

Becky: You're right. I noticed you mentioned that too. Like this would be your second option to call if the first one didn't work out.

Becky: Yeah. All right. And I think real quick, I think we have one more time for one more section to review.

### Explore our FAQs and other resources to get answers to your questions
[Becky reviews FAQs.]

Becky: Oh, go ahead.

> P9: Well, there's a managing VA profile could possibly for login or that bottom right. If you go down, there's that one that, you know, helpful VA numbers. I think it's more down other topics like that one right there [referring to Helpful VA phone numbers link under Other topics and questions].

> P9: So like those something that could help you, you know, might help you figure out what you're trying to do.

Becky: Yeah, yeah, that that I see. I see why that would why you'd gravitate towards those two things. Let's go to managingyourva.gov profile and see if the answer is on here.

[Becky reviews Verifying your identity on VA.gov [page]

Becky: So while it's not answering my question directly, it's telling me, OK, maybe I should try id.meinsteadoflogin.gov.

> P9: Well, it kind of does mention that. I mean, to me that does answer the question.

> P9: OK, Oh crap. I can't use my passport for login.gov. I can only use my driver's license or state issue ID. So I, if I want to use my passport, I do ID dot me. So that's that is helpful.

> P9: So that's that is helpful. I mean, like the answers that question.

Becky: Yeah, yeah, that and this shows you, you know how you you can go through all the links and land on this answer here. Any questions or comments on that whole process, the FAQ process?

> P9: No, go back one page, please. Yes, scroll up. Keep going, keep going. Stop right there, OK, The click on no, the step by step the, the very first link right below it, that one right there, What happens if you click on that? [How to verify your identity for your Login.gov account link in search results]

> P9: So keep going, OK, Slowly Scroll down, please. OK, so, OK, so right there, there, there you go.

> P9: So that actually answers my question right there, 'cause you're trying to use your passport and then it shows you can't use it.

> P9: Yeah, it's saying, I see that it's saying, you know, you can only use your driver's license or state issued ID.

## Cool down
Becky: Yeah. All right. Well, I'll, I'll stop sharing right now and give us just a quick two minutes to maybe reflect on a little time just reflecting on everything we went through today.

Becky: And so is there anything that you liked on the contact us page? Anything that could have been easier?

> P9: Sure. Easier on that one page, you know, Well, both pages, the the map page, where to try to find my location on that one for the again, that putting my what issues do I have of trying to collect?

> P9: You know, I kept trying to push in the box, but most part of me, it did answer my questions. It was, you know, I was able to find different options, not necessarily what I was looking for. But again, you can't have the answers to everything.

> P9: I mean, it would be great to have a search bar and everything that would actually answer that on the main page.

> P9: Hard to say if that would, if that would work or not, but that would be where I would try to go for and look, look to, to use.

> P9: But I mean, definitely we were able to find what we're looking for for the sake of this demonstration, but still that. And then I learned more 'cause I do. You can't, I did not know you can't use your passport for login.gov.

> P9:  So it's good to, you know, I, I learned something from them.

Becky: So, Oh, great. Well, I'm glad you you learned something new there.

[Map page, and putting my issues didn’t work. For the most part, it did have options and answers but not for everything. Search bars on everything would be great.]
