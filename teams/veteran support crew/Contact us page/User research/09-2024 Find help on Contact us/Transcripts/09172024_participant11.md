## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
[*How long have you been a Veteran? -Since 1982. 
*Have you used the Contact Us page? It just came out, I have, Yes, during COVID-19, I had to have my appointments and was given an iPad from the VA. When I would lose my password or have technical problems, I would call them and I also use My HealtheVet. I know E-benefits will be going away soon and it’s all confusing to me.
So many things are changing and so many ways to log in. Verifying my identity and login is what gets me. It’s a bit much.
*How did you find the right phone number to call them? – It’s on the back of my tablet. 
*Would you say calling by phone is your preference? -Yes. The secure messaging was through My HealtheVet. 
*Are you familiar with finding information on the Contact Us page? -Yes, that’s frustrating. I expect to get a live person when you’re spending your money. You have to go through all this trouble to get a live person at the VA. Having to go through so much artificial intelligence instead of a live person right away. 
It’s traumatic because it triggers my PTSD because it's so frustrating when it shouldn’t have to be.]

## Scenarios
### Login scenario
[The first thing I would do is press, “call us” and explain why I can’t log in and all I have is a passport. Because hopefully, I can speak to a live person, eventually. You try to cram all this information and it’s frustrating.]
### Claims scenario
[🟡notes]

## Review each scenario
[The VA 411, I did not know that there until today.]

## Cool down
[I don’t care about the Chatbot, they have so many issues.
TIME OVER.]
