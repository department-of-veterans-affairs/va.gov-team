## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
Becky: And first, I'd like to begin by learning more about your experience with VA customer support. So starting off around how long have you been a veteran?

> P6: I've been a veteran since [number]. I joined in [number], I got out in [number], so [number] years, something like that.

Becky: Yeah, that's very impressive. Remembering exact exact year dates. I know I struggle with that.

> P6: Well, I turned 18 into service, so, very easily.

Bcky: Yeah, that's awesome.

> P6: And, and in your time as a veteran, have you ever used the Contact us page on VA.gov or, or maybe reached out to VA for customer support, anything like that?

> P6: I have. And sometimes I get frustrated because I'm either not finding what I need or I'm not. Maybe I'm not asking in the right way. So I'm not sure if it's the program or it's me. 

> P6: So I usually just try to call somebody. I'm like, am I calling the right place? I always get the answer one way or the other, but sometimes I struggle a little bit.

Becky: Yeah. I'm, I'm curious, can you walk me through the most recent experience you've had with maybe using the Contact us page or reaching out to VA for help?

> P6: Well, I was trying, I do travel, you know, expense, you know, travel pay.

> P6: So I was trying to get that started again, 'cause I, you know, I, I, I wasn't qualifying for a while because of my, you know, with the, my, my, my income.

> P6: But then now I think it was two months ago, whatever I, you know, became eligible again.
 
> P6: So I wanted to go in there and I did and I was able to go on there and do my, you know, in, you know, put in for my pay or whatnot.

> P6: But some of them were saying, I don't remember that word, but it wasn't approved for whatever reason, it was right.

> P6: So I said, well, I gotta call somebody to see, you know, what should I do? Am I doing something wrong?

> P6: So I went into the page and like contact us, call us and I wasn't getting anybody. I wasn't getting to try to get a travel expense.

> P6: I wasn't I was like going around in circles. I said, just gotta something gotta be wrong. So then I went and I tried because I don't give up on anything.

> P6: I called and they gave me a number, called this number and nobody was answering the number. I was frustrated.

> P6: I said, you know what, I'm gonna give it a rest. Maybe I'm just being frustrated so I'm not getting what I need.

> P6: But in a couple of days I said, you know what? I think maybe if I go to the, you know, the app, maybe if I send a message, you know, secure messaging, maybe that'll work.

> P6: So I went in there and I went through secure messaging and I don't remember the exact. I think it said travel something. I don't remember what it was.

> P6: I went in there and I said, well, I'm not sure if I'm getting the right person, but this is what I need to do.
 
> P6: I think within an hour I got an answer back. I think within an hour I got an answer back. And he says, oh, walk me through it.

> P6: Look through this, look through that. Fantastic. Apparently I had, I had signed up for direct deposit, but when I did it, it didn't look like it took.

> P6: Does that make any sense?

Becky: Yeah.

> P6: It didn't give me like, hey, OK, congratulations, whatever, something like that. So I thought I didn't do it, but I was just seeing my checks coming in because they were going directly into my account and I it's only a few dollars that you really don't really notice, you know what I mean?

> P6: Your, your account goes up and down. So that was it. But yeah, I was frustrated. But I, I, I just can figure out a way, 'cause I'll go back and forth or I'll get a number to call. I'll call somebody. So yeah.

Becky: Yeah. You really persisted and found the right person at the end. But yeah, it's really frustrating. It took you, you know, so many tries.

Becky: So you started with phone. And then lastly, the secure messaging on the app was was where you could find your answer.

> P6: Yeah. I didn't think I would find it there. I thought that was just like, you know, the doctor's or maybe a pharmacy. Then I said, you know what, let me just look in there.

> P6: Maybe, maybe it'll take me somewhere. And it did. It really did. I was really, really impressed.

Becky: Yeah. Oh, that's awesome. Well, not awesome. You know, you had to call.

> P6: So no, that's why. Live and learn.

Becky: Oh, well, it's so helpful to learn about that experience that you've had just trying to contact support. 

## Scenarios
Becky: In the rest of the research session, I'll give you 2 scenarios where you as a veteran would reach out to VA for help.

Becky: So these are actually scenarios that are real questions veterans asked us this year, just reworded.

> P6: OK, Yeah.

Becky: And before we do that, I'm going to send you a link to our current Contact us page on VA.gov, which which may look familiar to you.

Becky: So I'll send it in the chat right now and let me know if you can open that link.

> P6: And you want me to do it right through the chat?

Becky: Yes. Yeah, open the chat and then you can click on the link.

> P6: Oh, you're assuming I know what I'm doing, right?

Becky: That's no worries, on the bottom...

> P6: Oh you see here it goes. OK, chat. OK, so I see something there. Oh, here it goes. So I'm just going to go click on it.

Becky: Yes.

> P6: OK, so I see it's is it going? It's not doing anything though. Oh, there it goes. OK, I see it says Contact us, get answers to your question, blah blah blah blah. Yeah, I got it.

Becky: OK, perfect. The second question and I can definitely help out with this next one is if you have you ever shared your screen on Zoom before?

> P6: I believe I did it last time I did, I did do it.

> P6: It actually, do permission. I did, I did, I have done it.

Becky: OK, Could you share your screen with the contact us page shown up at the bottom should be a share icon. It might be green. And then if you select that, it might ask you what you want to share, which is your screen. And then you'll have to select the page that's open.

> P6: Now I have to go back to where you're at. I have to go back to your picture.

Becky: Oh, yes, yeah. So go ahead and go back to the Zoom app.

> P6: Oh, did I kick you out? OK. You said at the bottom there should be a share. Let's close this. Is it being... OK. It says share contact content. Is that what you want?

Becky: What are the other options there?

> P6: It says it has a mute star video, share contact participants more. It doesn't give me...

Becky: Share content should be right. So you can go ahead and click on that share content.

> P6: Then it says screen photos, iCloud website, whiteboard, you want screen, right?

Becky: Yes, screen.

> P6: OK, screen it says everything on your screen, including notifications will be recorded. Enable do not disturb to prevent unexpected notifications.

> P6: OK, So start broadcast.
 
Becky: Yes, you can start your broadcast.

> P6: OK. It says start broadcast.

Becky: Oh, perfect. OK, I can see what's on your screen right now. And now what you need to do is just you can either navigate to the page you opened or just go back to the chat and select the the link I sent again.

Becky: So whatever is easiest for you there.

> P6: You could tell I'm not a expert on this thing, right?

Becky: No, no worries. I think you're doing great.

> P6: Yep there I go.

Becky: Perfect.

> P6: I'm probable with technology.

Becky: No, you know, you're doing great.
 
> P6: Are you good there? Can you see? I see you at the top, right? That's my mother going in and out. Yeah, that's my mother going in and in and out of my my house.

Becky: No worries.

> P6: Can you see my screen? Yes, I can see your screen right now.

> P6: OK.

### Claims scenario
Becky: All right. So we're ready to to go ahead with the first scenario. So again, you're, you're a veteran in this scenario and you currently get disability compensation for shoulder pain.

Becky: And you notice that your shoulder has been hurting more in the past couple of months. And you want to know if you can request more compensation for your shoulder pain because it's worse now.

Becky: And so starting on this page, show me how you would find help for this scenario. Yeah. And as you're showing me, tell me what you're thinking and what what you're noticing out loud too.

> P6: Well, you said I'm getting compensation for, So I'm getting what that is that, that's social security, disability or something, right? Am I correct?

Becky: Yeah, compensation for a VA-related condition.

> P6: OK. I would probably do a couple of things and see which one leads me in the right direction. I would probably start a a a chat and say hey this is the scenario.

> P6: Do you have a number I can call or I didn't even try to go Contact us online through ask VA and see if they already have that question being asked and answered.

Becky: OK, is there a reason why you'd want to do the Well, I noticed you said chat, but are you referring to the chat bot?

> P6: The chat bot, yeah, the ask the question. Yeah, 'cause usually, usually when you go through not only getting through the VA, but anything I, I do a lot of the chat that way and they usually the guide me in the right direction.

> P6: Or he had called this number or I'll have a live agent call you and, you know, and that's, that seems to work pretty good for me.

> P6: Or there's even a call us. I may even call, do a call us. There might be a number there.

> P6: So I may do a lot of different things to see which one, you know, puts me in the right direction.

Becky: Yeah, Yeah, that makes sense. And since you mentioned doing chat first, I'm wondering do you want to go ahead and and show me how you would do that?

> P6: OK, I would go. It should give me a little option there. OK.

> P6: So once I hit the chat [the jump link], it opened up to learn more about it and ask a question, but it also opened up a 411 information.

> P6: So I'll read through that to see what's going on there. And then it says, it says VA benefits hotline. There's a number right there. Boom. I can call that number.

> P6: It gave me a 800 number right there. I don't even have to go anymore. I don't believe so.

Becky: Oh, OK, So maybe are you saying you would you'd maybe skip the chat bot 1st and go straight to the number since that's the next thing you see?

> P6: Yeah, and that's the next thing I did. It just popped up. So I see an 800 number and they're open pretty late. They're Monday through Friday till 9:00. So that's pretty good.

> P6: So I do, I'll assume that's right. There is a, it says be a vendor, but you can't get any better than that.

Becky: Yeah, yeah. Why that phone number and not any of the others that you're seeing right now?

> P6: Because I need, I need to know about benefits. OK, that's what I'm thinking. I may be wrong, but this is and I call them, they say, hey, no, it is benefit related, but you should this is a better number.

> P6: Then they might give me another number. They might be able to help me.

Becky: OK, OK, so you're expecting maybe they can help you, maybe they'll give you a number, but it's really that word benefits that's drawing you to the number it sounds like, right?

Becky: OK, you know, let's say you call the number and they don't quite answer your question. What would you do next in the scenario?

> P6: Well, if they don't ask my question and I and I and they can't tell me further, I'll go right back on here and somebody's going to answer my questions.

> P6: I'll go right back here. Oh, there's another number here. It says VA health benefit hotline. I can call them as well too. There's another number.

Becky: OK. And I noticed you like before you mentioned, you know, you might do some of the online options, but when you see the phone numbers, you're, you're drawn to them first.

Becky: And so I'm wondering why, why would you call rather than any other option? Like what What draws you to calling first?

> P6: Two reasons. First of all, when when you call, this is some, even with regular, when I do that even to my kids, sometimes I call them and I want to say something to them.

> P6: I text them and they're like, but I'm like, no, if I call somebody, I can express myself better rather than to and I can give them like the whole scenario rather than to like it's blue.

> P6: Oh, but why is it, you know what I mean? It's too much back and forth and it just to me, it's like, I can't do it. I can't type that fast.

> P6: And if it seems like, you know, sometimes when you text someone and you and the text doesn't sound the way you want it to tell you, does that make sense?

> P6: So I think if I speak to someone, I say, Hey, let me this is what I have. And sometimes they, you don't even have to get out the whole story and they know exactly what it is.
 
> P6: So this is what you want. Or they have to write words that you need to say, you know what I mean? Does that make sense? Like I'm doing right now to you?

> P6: So that's why. So that's why I think to me it's easier if I can call someone and then, you know, they may say, hey, you have to do this online.

> P6: Then I said, OK, then I'll then they'll either send me a link or say, hey, you know, go online. It should be pretty simple.

> P6: But if you have questions, you know, feel free to call or not. So I think that's why I would prefer a number.

> P6: But if I, I, I am still, I'm learning how to get better at just trying to maneuver the online stuff 'cause that's where everybody's going.

Becky: Yeah, that, that totally makes sense. Like there's maybe there's you're more comfortable with phone call right now and it's just seems easier to be able to express yourself rather than, you know, type something out and then be missing.

> P6: Yeah, yeah. You lose your train of thought too. It's like, you have to write a whole paragraph and it's like, no, it's just can I just call you?

Becky: Yeah. Oh, that makes sense. I guess for for the sake of the scenario, you know, you call the VA health benefits online.

Becky: It doesn't work out. What's your next step here?

> P6: Well, I saw at the top, I believe it was it says contact online. We have, there's an online question and answer, but I don't know if that's just question and answer that you're, you know, already formatted or let's see if there's anything else.

Becky: And just pausing there. What what do you think contact us online means? Like I know you mentioned question and answer. Is that what you think contact us online would mean?

> P6: Yeah, I think, yeah. Because, oh, it doesn't say question and answer. I just put that in myself.

> P6: No, wait a minute. I may, I may get something. I may get a where like a spot where I can ask questions because it says contact online through contact us online through  Ask VA.

> P6: So that's not AQ and a type thing. I it might be a, a regular, you know, regular check type thing.

> P6: Huh. I think I read it wrong.

Becky: Yeah, yeah, no worries. And the reason why I ask is because we know that this tool in particular can be a bit confusing.

Becky: So it was just helpful for to hear your initial reaction too, since, you know, that's what other folks might see if you're you're quickly skimming.

> P6: So yeah, that's what I thought it was a already pre answered, you know, Q&A type things. Yeah, yeah.

Becky: So what do you think it means now after maybe pausing a bit to review it?

> P6: Well, now it looks like I may be able to get kind of a chat going. That's what I would think so. Because if it's online, it has to be some kind of chat, am I correct?

Becky: Yeah. What do you think? What does a what does a chat mean to you?

> P6: It's where. Well, we go back and forth like, you know. Hello. My name is [name]. And how can I help you today? No, [name], I need help with ordering, you know, supplies.
 
> P6: Oh, OK. Thank you. This is what you need. You know, back and forth. It's like a like a text like type thing.

Becky: Got it. Great. Thanks for explaining that.

Becky: All right, I, I think I'll move this along to our next scenario now, which is our our last one. So go ahead and just scroll all the way to the top or you can refresh your page so that we we're acting as if we're landing on the page again for the first time.

> P6: OK, yeah.

### Login scenario
Becky: And in this scenario, this time you're still a veteran and you're, you can't create an account on VA.gov and you're trying to create a login.gov account, but you're finding that login.gov doesn't let you use your passport as a form of identification.

Becky: But you also don't have your driver's license because you've lost it recently. So all you have is your passport again, starting on this page. Show and tell me how you would find help for this scenario.

Becky: Yeah, And I see you're scrolling. Are you reading through just the headings there or?

> P6: Yeah, I'm, I'm reading the headings in a little description.

> P6: The ones that do have a description. OK, that one sounds like it might be able to help you help. This benefits, My HealtheVet.

Becky: OK, so you're looking through the numbers now.

> P6: Mm Hmm. I'm trying to choose, change, change your as you change your VA claims schedule. Is that all there is?

> P6: There's something more. There's more at the bottom. Resources...

Becky: Yeah, on the footer now.

> P6: Yeah, just to see if there's any. Sometimes these little things are helpful. OK, My help from the credit representative with VA apps Tune career outreach.

> P6: You're welcome. K, news release.

Becky: Are you just reading by, by each of the columns there?

> P6: Yeah, I'm reading the. I'm reading the columns to see if there's anything that'll get me.

Becky: What are you looking for?

> P6: I'm gonna guess, anything that clicks that you're just telling me that it's gonna be able to help me with my create a login and and I'm not finding anything specific for a login, but I am finding resource and support contact us.

> P6: So I'm not sure about that.

Becky: Oh, what are you not sure about?

> P6: I'm not sure if that's going to get me where I want.

Becky: Ah, OK.

> P6: So I might start there. But then there was something else that I saw earlier.

Becky: So you're scrolling back up to Explore FAQ section.

> P6: Yeah, this is what I do. I'll go up and down. I'm like, maybe I missed something. OK, see they have an explore our resources and support and support content.

> P6: So I'm not and here I would just start playing around till I hit something that bases I might have to go back and forth and if I don't find what I need then I'll find a phone number that's gonna help me.

Becky: OK and you can go ahead and go ahead and explore too if you want to click on anything. This is a totally live page, so I should be connected to everything.

> P6: OK, Yeah. OK, let's let's go into supported resources. See what this does.

> P6: You can't find blah blah blah. It's just the best of instructions for using Oh, this white Oh, let me see you can't find.

> P6: This is not Q&A about better risk blah blah blah step by step instructions for using VA government tools.

> P6: That should help, right? Huh. It says search research and support articles or all of VA.gov.

Becky: What what do you think that means there?

> P6: Well, if there's a lot like if you need some kind of homelessness group or some kind of support where they can get you or it says or allva.gov.

> P6: So that should be able to answer logins or benefits or anything like that or medical or that's what I'm thinking.

> P6: So if I put in here help with log on, help with creating a log? No. How would I word it? 

Becky: Yeah, yeah. I'll give you the scenario again. You're a veteran. You can't create an account on va.gov and you're trying to create a login.gov account and you only have your passport creating log on.


> P6: Let me see what this gets me. It could be nice if I could spell it. Log on. [Types in `Help with creating log on`]

> P6: Let me see what that does. Yeah. Oh, Where did that put me? Oh. Created an account for va.gov. There we go. It's getting started in 2021. You will need. OK. I know I need. I know that's what I need, but that's OK.

> P6: Let me see if I hit it. How do I reset? No. No, I don't want to reset. I don't want to find. No. It might have to be the top one.

Becky: So you're just scrolling down the the list of articles here.

> P6: Yeah, see here goes creating an account for VA log log. Let me see what that gives me huh creating an account.

> P6: So I didn't remember it's going into to help me create a log on. OK, let me see step by step choose your account blah blah blah blah blah blah and create a log on if you want to learn more about between choosing your account.

> P6: Yeah, but I don't have all the information. That's where it's not giving me that. How does it mean?

> P6: Wait, what does it mean to verify my identity and why do I have to do it?

> P6: I don't think it'll log on. Hmm. Trust me, if If I don't have a mobile phone, how does multi factor authentication, for from ID verification preparing.

> P6: I don't see anything where it's telling me that I don't have to. If I don't have the right credentials that I need, I'll create a lot. 

Becky: Yeah. What would you would? Would you stay on this page? Would you try to find something else? Would you do? What would you do next?

> P6: After reviewing everything, I would try to stay on here. What type of account should I create? I would try to stay on here, see if I even try to. But I already did that, so I already know... Apply for a printed card...

> P6: I think I'm going to have to call somebody. I'm going to think I'm going to have to call that four VA 411. Yeah, I think because I think anywhere that I go in here, it's going to make me give them what I did that I don't have would be a lot.

> P6: 2 accounts. How can I get more support? Can I get log on? I don't have a mobile phone whatever. Not sure if I have a log on. How do I create an account?

> P6: Let me see what this is. You can create an account, an e-mail. OK an e-mail and a unique password that will not use up account. You need to multi factor authentication. Learn more about learn more about the factors blah blah blah.

> P6: OK the first time you use the account you benefits information you need to verify ID and here you go phone number Travis OK OK, what happens if I don't OK, what if I am not sure if I ready OK that this should be verifying my account.

> P6:  There are more about how about here for VA on if I go to ID let me see where is a parent ID dot me.

Becky: Yeah and just as a a reminder in this scenario you're trying to you are trying to create a login.gov account.

Becky: But yeah, what are you Why did you I'm curious why'd you click on this one in particular

> P6: Cecause it's actually been a good do an ID and maybe I can somehow I remember I did mine.

> P6: That's where I log into everything. I don't know it's so long ago. I don't remember what I did.

> P6: I'm trying to find, to create it, trying to ID myself without using what I, you know what I mean, 'cause I was create an Id, I think I would try to go in there and try to create it and have them, 'cause I know they verified.

> P6: I believe when I did mine, they verified like the the day that I went in or the day that I left or something like that.

> P6: Don't remember quite. So maybe I would try it that way and have them maybe say, hey, no, this is what we need. And if that don't work, I'm gonna call somebody. But I would still try to link into one of these.

Becky: OK. Are you saying you'd, what do you mean by look into one of these?

> P6: I would click on one and try to start create an ID that way without just logging in with the ID dot me.

> P6: It should be I, I, I believe when I did it, they asked me for the date thing was my social and the date I went in.

> P6: I might be wrong, but it's, it's so long ago, I honestly don't remember, but I, I, I even if I have to be here 2 hours, I would figure out how to find my how to find those. I don't know.

> P6: See this driver's license. See, it's telling you to upload. You know, it says upload a driver's license or state ID passport or huh.

> P6: See, you could do you, said I had a passport, right?

Becky: Yeah, you only have a passport, but you can't create a login.gov account.

Becky: So what what are you reading here?

> P6: It says to verify who I am. It says it's it's I can upload a license ID, passport or, or passport card.

> P6: So if I click on that, it should let me do it with that. That's what it sounds like it would let me do it because it does it, it does tell me that I can use that.

> P6: So I think I would go in there.

Becky: Great. Yeah. That sounds right. So you're, you know, you're reading through some of the screenshots and you're seeing that you can use it. I forget what it says, driver's license ID, passport.

Becky: So you're thinking, OK, this sounds right.

> P6: I got a passport. Yeah, that sounds kind of right. I would go, I would go through there.

Becky: Right. It looks like you're able to find your answer there.

> P6: I, I, I that's one thing I do, as long as I'm not hurting anything, I'll click on and on and on and go back.

> P6: And like I said, if, if I'm feel so frustrated that I can't find even though I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, then I'll find a phone number and I'm like, OK, somebody lead me in the right direction.

Becky: Yeah. I'm curious, Do you usually read so thoroughly through each article and just sort of Scroll down the whole page? Is that what you usually do?

> P6: Yeah, I try to look sometimes, usually depending on how you search for something. Like if you go to the top, I believe there was a search button on the on the home screen.

> P6: I believe there was a search button there already. So if you would put something like create log on without with just passport, it might just zoom you straight into there.

> P6: So sometimes I do that, sometimes I ended up and and The thing is when you're when you're trying to do something like that, and I found that that if you word it a certain way, it gets you there a lot quicker.

> P6: So, so that I know that not here. It's on the back on the home screen. I don't remember where the whole screen is at, but that's where it's at.

Becky: Yeah, great. No, it's helpful to hear. You know, you also, it sounds like you also utilize the search, the search tool.

> P6: Yeah, the top.

Becky: Great. Well, that brings us to the end of the second scenario. So you can go ahead and if you can't stop sharing your screen, if you see that option anywhere, maybe here we go.

> P6: I think I did it. You see.

Becky: That's right at the top. If you press the screen once.

> P6: There it goes.

Becky: Perfect.

> P6: Oh, there I go. OK.

Becky: All right, Well, thanks for reviewing the scenarios with me.

> P6: And sorry, what was that? Something happened. It says screen broadcasting. Oh, this is just enough. OK, You hit. OK here.

Becky: What is the what's it asking you? 

> P6: It says screen broadcasting. Live broadcast assume has stopped due to attempt to start an invalid broadcast session.

Becky: OK, click OK and see if does anything happen after that?

> P6: Nope. We go back to you. That's it.

Becky: OK, great. No worries. Thanks for thanks for checking in with me.

> P6: Yeah.

## Review each scenario
Becky: All right, so, so we went through the contact us page. I know in, in some ways it's helpful, in some ways it's not. So while you wait for us to make those updates and improvements to the page, do you think it'd be helpful if I showed you how some of these contact options work right now?

> P6: OK, see. And you know, you know, you know what the hard part of the of, of fixing the contact, the contact us page.

> P6: I mean, this is my, because it also depends on the user.

Becky: Exactly.

> P6: Because I mean, I'm pretty resourceful and I'm like, I'll go back and forth and I'm like, blah, blah. You know, I'll go play with it and read a little bit, go here and here.

> P6: But sometimes you'll get somebody that if they don't find what they want right there and they're like, oh, this, this doesn't work.

> P6: This is no good. You know what I mean?

> P6: You want something and it depends like like here in [location], you know, and, and a lot of the population that, you know, veterans are a little on the older side, you know what I mean?

> P6: So that's, that's hard. But to make it that broad when anybody can actually do it, you would have to ask each person, well, how do you need it? Then we'll personalize it for you. You know what I mean?

Becky: Yeah. Huh. That's, sorry. Before I share my screen, I guess you bring up a good point. Like you talked, you just mentioned personalization and how, you know, there's such a I've heard this phrase like a diverse range of folks and in the veteran population.

Becky: So how do you, what do you think about when you think of personalization? What do you mean by that?

> P6: That you would know exactly how I think. So when I open up the screen, it would say, hey, [name], you're looking for this.

> P6: OK, you know what I mean, where where you would say, OK, this is this is a a veteran that's they just got out the service.

> P6: They're mid 40s. So that means they've dealt with technology. So they know how to in out re go, you know, open up the screen like me.

> P6: I'm having a hard time just going back and forth with this with you. So this is something that they know where or maybe they have online classes and I, I see my daughter do it.

> P6: She does like 3 different screens and I'm like already doing Jay and it goes from one page to the other and one computer to the other.

> P6: I'm like, I would be lost. And so you would have, you know, when somebody that's using it, you know how to do it.

> P6: This little format for let's say a 40, 35 to 40 year old person. And then you would need a format for 45 to 50 year old person who hasn't, maybe he had that most exposure, you know, to, to that's just learning how to use the Internet or how to go in and out or it's scared to do it.

> P6: Maybe that's even another word. Like, I don't care. I'll go in there and I'll, I'll find what I need.

> P6: I will definitely find what I need. If I don't find it, I, I call my kids.

> P6: Hey, [name], this is what I need. I'm doing, what am I doing wrong?

> P6: I got her on the phone and she was like, wait, man, do this, do that, do this, do that and we'll figure it out.

> P6:  So it would, you would have to have a few different formats. Did that make sense?

> P6: Whereas somebody that actually says somebody that's really savvy and, you know, knows how to do 3 different screens, they're like, OK, does that make sense?

> P6: So I know that's hard. I know that's hard to do and I understand.

Becky: Yeah, no worries. And you know, it's, it's our job to, you know, take the feedback and figure out how to make it happen. So this is this gives you a lot of good ideas.

Becky: I guess I'm curious like in your you as a as a person, as a veteran, what would be the like ideal contact us page for you?
 
> P6: Oh wow. I guess the search bar because like I said, I have been trying to learn how to word it so I can get to where I need to go faster.

> P6: Like for instance, I was looking for those are those little reachers that reach when you try to change a light bulb and it's and it's and it's too, it's too high.

> P6: They have these extender pole Reacher thingamajiggies.

Becky: Yeah, yeah.

> P6: OK. Right. So you can't put thingamajiggies in the search bar. So I was looking for one the other day in Amazon and I put a light bulb.

> P6: Well, that put light bulb Reacher bulb reaches something like that. And he gave me all kinds of stuff that had nothing to do with light bulb. Would I need it?

> P6: I said, I'm wording this wrong. So then I stopped and I thought, woman, and I said, this is what I did.

> P6: And I put, you know, highlight bulb Reacher boom, gave me the extender pose and all that.

> P6: So it's just a matter of a, a, a search bar that actually that is not limited, you know, does that make sense?

> P6: Where if I put light bulb extensions, they would know what it is not one of those electrical extensions that you use, you know, when you need, but a light bulb changer extension. Does that make sense?

Becky: Yeah. No, this, this is totally making sense. Like to, in order for right now, a search to be really useful, you have to know exactly what to search or else the wording.

> P6: Yes.

> P6: And you, and you gotta remember that there's a lot of us out there and I mean us, like here, I'm in [location]. So this is, you know, [name], like they say.

> P6: So we're a little on the, you know, a little older side and a lot of stuff they, you know, people won't use like when we go to like, I know, like I, when I go to the doctor, I check in on my phone and I do my travel thing right there.

> P6: Boom, boom, boom, you know, 'cause I've already learned that, but I have my kids to teach.

> P6: A lot of people don't have that privilege of having somebody teach them how to navigate, you know, a, a, a, a cell phone.

> P6: And then I'm, and you see, I'm still learning. I'm still pretty, you know, but I can navigate it. [word], when I want to pretty decent.

> P6: And like I said, I'll get what I want, even if I have to go back and forth and hey, here and they'll just put it away.

> P6: I do figure it out, but then you have to see use it when somebody that's just going to have an app, you know, the VA app or you know, VA.gov and say, hey, I want to hit this and I want it to just set me to where it was.

> P6: So it has to be a little more, I guess age appropriate. Maybe that's pretty probably a better word. So that, that's just my thinking, Yeah.

Becky: And, and for the record, I think you, you know, you found the answer eventually through the search or not through the search or through the FAQ section. So I think you, you did really well there.

Becky: And you know, what I'm hearing is definitely to take into account just the varying levels of digital literacy that that folks have.

> P6: That's the that's the one. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Becky: And I guess Speaking of that, just right, right before we end, maybe this is a good segue, but maybe it'd be like I mentioned before, I asked if it'd be helpful to maybe just walk through some of the tools on here as just a demonstration, you know, as we're working on improving this page and you mentioned the chat bot at the beginning, so I'll, I'll focus on this one since you might find it interesting.

> P6: Is that you talking to me now?

Becky: Yes, it is.

> P6: OK. I'm like, what happened?

Becky: No worries. No worries. Can you see my screen in the the page?

> P6: Oh, yes. This is what I was talking about earlier. Yeah.

[Becky does walk through. See this section in the conversation guide]

Becky: Do you have any questions or I'm curious any reactions or thoughts to, to this?

> P6: No, that's be exactly what I would have done. Try to go with that.

> P6: Yeah, 'cause sometimes they'll, they'll, they'll pinpoint, but sometimes they're not sure what you're asking at the same time.

> P6: So they're like, OK, what's going on? Do they, do they want to log on? Then they don't.

> P6: So that's, that's why I say sometimes even no matter how good the, the chat is, sometimes you just need a live person to, you know, to walk you through what it is or tell you, you know what I mean?

Becky: Yeah, absolutely. That totally makes sense. All right, well, I'll stop sharing my screen since we are we're sort of running out of time, but let me pull up this page again for myself.

## Cool down
Becky: All right, And in our last five minutes, I just wanted to spend a little bit of time reflecting on some of what we went through. And we started doing this a little bit before already.

Becky: But I'm curious about what you, what you thought about using the contact us page in both of those scenarios where, you know, you are wondering if you could get more compensation for worsening shoulder pain or how to create an account.

Becky: Is there anything that you liked or anything that could have been easier?

> P6: I think like I said, I'll, I'll go back to the to the search bar. I mean, I would like it to be I guess the word would be broader so that it understands what I'm saying.

> P6: Does that make sense? Like if I would you like, why would you put trying to can't create a a log, can't create a login with with just my passport where they would say, huh, OK, this person only has a passport.

> P6: Let me put him towards says, hey, you know, that's why I think if you would have gone into that ID where it says you can verify yourself with a passport, I think that would have helped better than that login thing that you did. Maybe, I may be wrong. That makes sense?
 
Becky: Yeah. I see what you're saying, maybe if I, or in this scenario, creating the ID dot me account would have been easier since you read you can use the passport.

> P6: The passport. Yeah, Yeah, I think that would have probably gone in there a little bit better.

> P6: You never know and that's the way I did it because my is what I DI do everything for ID me and I I had no problems with it and I I love it.

Becky: Got it. OK, I see what you're saying. So like typing in the search ID dot me or something.

> P6: Yeah, right, right.

Becky: OK, yes, thank you for for that. Is there anything else you wanted to share with me maybe about this, this research process or just the session in general?

> P6: No, I'm yeah, you guys are doing it 'cause like I said, when I when I had when I did my coming back to the travel, I mean, I was just going frustrated, frustrated.

> P6: I don't know if I was just approaching it the wrong way, but and then when I said, when I said with a little bit long, I'm like, let's try this.

> P6: Maybe this is what I need. So I don't know. So that that's sometimes that's what it is. We just go about it the wrong way because we, we think about the first thing that we think and that the first idea that comes to us and we act on it.

> P6: Now sometimes we don't, we can't do that. So, so I did, but I think it's been very helpful. Now I, I know I can go what I can do now a little bit better too. So thank you for that.

Becky: Yeah, I'm glad it was, it was a bit helpful too. It's definitely helpful for me for just learning from you.
