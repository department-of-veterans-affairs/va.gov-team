## Intro - 5 minutes
> Start transcript: `LIVE TRANSCRIPT` > `ENABLE`.

Thanks for joining us today. How are you? My name is Becky, and
I’m a researcher from VA. I'll go over a couple of things before we get started. I work on improving VA.gov to make it easier for Veterans to find answers to their questions and VA contact information.

**What I hope to do today** is learn how to improve this process by understanding your experiences better.
**What I don't want to do** is add to any frustration you’ve had with VA in the past. I want to be up front and say that I don't have a way of fixing those past experiences. But, I do want to know about your frustrations in case they're things we can improve in the future.

So before we get started, when Perigean set up this session, they asked if you’re okay with a couple of observers joining us. This helps my team members learn from our conversation as well, and they also help me take notes, so we capture everything you share.

**I want to confirm now, are you okay with a couple of my teammates joining us to observe?**
- `IF NO` Use Slack to let observers know.
- `IF YES` They're in the waiting room, so I'm going to let them into the meeting now.
> Let in observers from the waiting room.

Welcome. Can everyone say hello? This is `PARTICIPANT`.

**Thanks everyone, now I’ll ask you to turn off your cameras and mute yourselves for the rest of the session.**

There are a few other things I want to mention before we start:
- **This session should take about an hour.** I’ll make sure we finish on time, so I may occasionally move us along during the session, so we can cover everything.
- **We’re here to learn your honest opinions.** Negative feedback is helpful too, because it helps us learn how we can improve.
- **I also want to make it clear that we’re not testing your ability.** So, for example, if I ask if you understand something, it’s because I want to make sure writing is clear.
- **I’m going to share a live page on VA.gov with you today.** You'll be able to interact with it as you would any other page on VA.gov.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, you just have to let me know.** And that might be a pause to get some water or to stop the session completely. You'll be paid even if we don't complete the full session.
- Last thing is about recordings. We can record the session to help us confirm we captured your opinions accurately. Sometimes, we also share video clips with our colleagues at VA. If we do this, we remove your face and your name from the videos. We don’t link anything you share in the session to any information that could identify you.  **Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - `IF NO` Don't record
  - `IF YES` Once I start recording, I’ll confirm again.
    
> Start recording: `RECORD TO CLOUD`.

I’ve started recording. I'd like to confirm again: **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

And **Are you comfortable if we share video clips with our colleagues at VA if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

## Before showing Contact us page - 10 minutes
It seems like we’re ready to get started. I'd like to begin by learning more about your experience with VA customer support.

- How long have you been a Veteran?
- Have you ever used the Contact us page on VA.gov? 
   - `IF NO`
      - Why might you use the Contact us page? 
      - What would you expect to see on it?
      - How else have you found contact information or answers to your questions?
   - `IF YES`
      -  Can you walk me through that experience of using the Contact us page?
      - Did you find what you were looking for?
      -  Did you try to find answers online first? 
      -  How did you find the right contact information?
      -  How do you usually contact the VA? Phone, online? Why?
      -  How was the support you received?

</details>

Thanks, it’s helpful to learn about your experience with VA.

Next, I’d like to give you two scenarios where you, as a Veteran, would reach out to VA for help. These scenarios are actually real questions Veterans asked us this year, just reworded.

Before we do that, I'm going to send you a link to the current Contact us page on VA.gov.

> Send link in Zoom chat.
- https://www.va.gov/contact-us
  
- Can you open the link in the chat?
  
- Have you shared your screen on Zoom before?
  - `IF YES` Great. Can you please share your screen?
  - `IF NO` I’ll walk you through how to do that…
    
Thanks! Now I’m able to see your screen too.

> Screen: Contact us

## Scenarios – 30 minutes

### Login scenario – 15 minutes
I’ll give you your first scenario now. We’ll review two scenarios in total in this session.

> IMPORTANT: Explain scenario.

**I’d like you to pretend you're a Veteran who can’t create an account on VA.gov. You're trying to create a login.gov account. But Login.gov doesn’t let you use your passport as a form of identification. You don’t have your driver's license because you lost it recently.**

**Starting on the Contact us page, the page you have open right now, show me how you would find help for this scenario.**

As you’re showing me, tell me what you’re thinking and noticing too.

### Claims scenario - 15 minutes
Let’s go back to the Contact us page for our second and final scenario. You can select ‘Contact us’ at the top of the page to get back to the page.

> IMPORTANT: Explain scenario.

**Imagine you're a Veteran who currently gets disability compensation for shoulder pain. You notice your shoulder has been hurting more in the past couple of months. You want to know if you can request more compensation for your shoulder pain because it's worse now.**

**Starting on the Contact us page show me how you would find help for this new scenario.**

Again, as you’re showing me, tell me what you’re thinking and noticing too.

## Review login scenario - 10 minutes
Okay, we’re finished with each scenario now. So you can stop sharing your screen now.

> Stop sharing screen

Thank you for reviewing those scenarios with me. Your input has been really helpful.

I know this page isn't very clear right now. While you wait for us to make updates, is it helpful if I show you how some of these contact options work?

> - If `YES` Share screen showing Contact us page
> - If `NO` Skip to **Cool down**

We're going to review the login scenario, which was: You can’t use your passport to verify your identity while you’re trying to create a Login.gov account.

> Review each section

#### Contact us online through Ask VA
You can send a message to VA through Ask VA and get a response within 7 business days. 

> Walk through first page of Ask VA form.

#### Ask our chatbot a question
Unfortunately, the chatbot doesn't answer this question right now. But it would provide more contact information.

> Walk through chatting with chatbot.

#### Call us
I called the MyVA411 number with this login scenario, and the agent was able to answer this general question. I'll walk you through my experience.
>- The agent will ask you for your name, callback number, an optional email
>- Then they placed me 2 minute hold to look up information
>- There are different options they would suggest if a Veteran called in with this question:
>    - They would provide a number to call Login.gov customer support
>    - They would advise you to try ID.me because you could verify your identity without a passport
>    - They would advise you to reach out to your medical center for help with verifying your identity

#### Contact your local VA facility
I found my local VA medical center and called them with this login scenario. The patient enrollment agent ended up directing me to the MyHealtheVet help desk. Your experience might vary dependning on your local facility. I'll walk you through my experience.
>- The operator asked me what I was calling about, then transferred me to the patient enrollment line.
>- The patient enrollment agent couldn't answer my question, but they directed me to the MyHealtheVet help desk.

#### Explore our FAQs and other resources to get answers to your questions
Lastly, if you wanted to try to find answered on VA.gov, you could search in our 'Resources and support' section. Here's what I would do.

>-	Select ‘Explore our resources and support content’
>-	Search ‘verify identity’
>-	Select ‘Verifying your identity on VA.gov`
>-	Scroll down to ‘How do I verify my identity online?`

Do you have any questions or reactions to what I just reviewed?

## Cool down - 5 minutes
Okay, I’ll stop sharing my screen now.

> Stop sharing screen

I’d love to spend a little time reflecting before we finish.
-	What did you think of using the ‘Contact us’ page in those scenarios? Is there anything you liked?
-	Is there anything that could have been easier?
-	Is there anything else you want to share with me, about this process?
  
<details>
  <summary>Key things to notice</summary>

-	What did they like and what would they change?
</details>

I want to circle back and ask if **you're comfortable if we maybe share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** We’ll remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing. And we’ll only share the videos with VA partners to help improve VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - If ‘YES’ Is there any part of our discussion you wouldn’t want us to share in a video clip?

Well, I think you've answered all of my questions.

Thanks again for sharing your time with me. It’s been so helpful to learn from you.

Do you have any questions for me?

Okay, well thank you so much for the time.

Perigean will send you a thank you note with some information that you can pass along to other Veterans if they’d like to participate in future research sessions.

I hope you have a lovely rest of the day.

## Pause or exit strategies
We can use these strategies to prepare for difficult situations.

### If the participant isn't feeling well
I'm sorry you're [not feeling well]. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.
> If they choose to continue...

Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

### If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress
This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?

> If they choose to take a break and come back...

Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about [topic you left off on]. Are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

### If the participant decides to stop
Thank you for your time today, I completely understand your decision to stop.

> If they seem distressed...

Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

### If the participant is fine to continue, but you aren't 
I hear that you're okay to continue. Before we do, I realized that I need a minute. I'm going to turn off my camera and microphone, and get a glass of water. Is that okay with you? I'll be back in 3 minutes.

> If you're still not able to continue, after you pause...

Thanks for letting me take a break. You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm realizing that I'm not going to be able to continue this session. You will still be paid for the full time. I really appreciate you sharing with me today. Is it okay with you if we stop? Thanks very much.
