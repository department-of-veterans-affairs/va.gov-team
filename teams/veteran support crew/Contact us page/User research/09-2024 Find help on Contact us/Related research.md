## Key findings
- **Preference for live agent and self-service**: People prefer live agent chat and other online self-service support because they think they'll get answers quicker.
- **Calling as a last resort**: People call as a last resort if they can't find answers online.
- **Confusing phone numbers**: People aren't sure which phone number to use.

## Quotes
**Preference for live agent and self-service**
> I prefer to do things online or with a virtual agent because it feels things online or with a virtual agent because it feels faster.

**Calling as a last resort**
> I went through all modes… 

> I looked at the website and didn't get the response I needed, then sent the information through VA ASK, which is their messenger service, and didn’t like that answer, 

> so as a lasts-ditch resort, I called in to try to to get an explanation.

**Confusing phone numbers**
> Honestly, I don’t really know [how I knew to call the NCC number], it's just calling numbers...it's just trial and error.

## Opportunities for Contact us
**Preference for live agent and self-service**
- HMW make it easier to find these options? 
- HMW make self-service options a better experience? 
- HMW measure the self-service experience to measure what's working for users and what isn't?
- HMW present people with self-service options before they decide to escalate to calling? 

**Calling as a last resort**
- HMW help people get to phone numbers who prefer calling first? (This is something I've heard during an Ask VA user research session) OR who can't get their questions answered by available self-service support?

**Confusing phone numbers**
- HMW help people choose the right phone number? 
- HMW lead people to the right phone number? 
- HMW explain what each phone number is for?

## Ideas for Contact us
**Preference for live agent and self-service**
- Group content by type of channel (self-service, contact VA directly..., etc.)

**Calling as a last resort**
- Move phone numbers to bottom of page

**Confusing phone numbers**
- Add short description about what each phone number is for

## Research question ideas for Contact us
**Preference for live agent and self-service**
- Are the recommended links what people would expect to see?
- Does grouping content by type of channel help people find what they're looking for?
- Can people find the information they need on existing pages from Contact us?

**Calling as a last resort**
- Where are people in VA.gov when they decide to call as a last resort?
- How do they try to find phone numbers? Do they go to the Contact us page? 

**Confusing phone numbers**
- Does a short description to the phone number help people know which number to call?
- Does a short description make it harder to find a number? Because the page is longer and/or info is hidden in an accordion?
