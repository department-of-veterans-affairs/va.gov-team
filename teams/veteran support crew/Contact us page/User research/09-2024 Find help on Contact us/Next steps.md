## Key takeaways from Oct 31 meeting
### Add descriptions to phone numbers
- Because the descriptions would be brief, we'd just add text to the page. We don't need to use a component like the additional info component. 

### Ask VA & VA secure messaging
- For VA secure messaging, we need to update content to deemphasize "secure." We don't want to imply that other VA messaging tools aren't secure. 

### Update "Helpful online tools" section
- Hold on updating tools listed until we get link click data from GA.

## Next steps
