# Overview
[View our study in the VA.gov Research Repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/661)

## Background 
The Contact us page ([va.gov/contact-us](va.gov/contact-us)) helps people get answers to questions about VA benefits and services by connecting people to the following types of customer support channels: self-service, live agent, and asynchronous agent.

We stood up the Contact us page quickly in 2020 and have made ad-hoc updates since then. It consistently gets the lowest customer satisfaction scores compared to other pages on VA.gov. As of 2024, its CSAT score is around 20%. VA.gov's overall CSAT score is around 60%. 

- View these scores in the [VA.gov CSAT Score Dashboard](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/1545882322).

## Research Goals	
Our research goals are to:  
-	Understand whether people can find the right support (answers or channels) to resolve their issues
-	Understand how people choose phone numbers
-	Understand what people expect on the Contact us page

### Outcome
We already know there are different ways other websites and mobile apps have approached effective support experiences. We’ll use this research to inform how we’ll update the Contact us page.
