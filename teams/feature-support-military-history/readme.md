# VA.gov Feature Support Military History Team Repository

The VA Flagship mobile application “VA Health and Benefits” serves an authenticated
experience to millions of Veteran users. This product was launched in 2021 and has been well
received by the Veteran community. 

Now that the product has passed its Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage, we need to methodically expand the features and experiences available to Veterans within this platform. Due to the nature of Government software development, it is very difficult for a centralized mobile team to understand the stakeholder landscape, dependent systems, and business rules which enable the functionality of each VA.gov application or feature.

OCTO has determined the best path for successfully expanding the VA flagship mobile application is to find talented mobile technologists, give them the opportunity to work with the teams building web features, and create mobile appropriate versions of those experiences.
