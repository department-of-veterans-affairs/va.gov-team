| TIMELINE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE DUE TO THE FOLLOWING KNOWN RISKS AND POTENTIAL IMPACTS: 
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
| **Discovery work** - there is a lot to be determined about the integration and impact on the user experience. As more clarity becomes available better estimates of the development effort to implement will be possible. |
| **User Research** - It is imperative to test the experience and functionality before we launch the product. Recruiting available Veterans for research can take time and may delays.                                      |
| **Development Complexities & VA System Integrations** - The complexity of development can impact the timeline. Including establishing connections to VA services can be an involved process. As solution(s) is(are)  fully explored and as requirements emerge the timelines may shift.                                                                                                                                           |
| **Research Discoveries**  - As a result of research production errors or refinements may be identified and require further development                                                                                    |
| **VA.gov Platform Approvals**  - Through the collaboration cycle launch blocking issues can be identified and will require development team to address before launch.                                                            |
