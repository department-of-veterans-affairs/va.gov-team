On August 6 2025 we were told that vaNotify was going to start rotating its keys every 180 days.

They are building a self service portal that will allow us to generate our own keys.  

The process will involve generating a key, and updating the params in AWS param store.

  Will update here with specific details once we have access to the portal. It will be accessed through VA slack cag

Format of the key should be `keyName-serviceID-secret`

Once a key has been obtained you will need to
  - Log into AWS
  - Access the Param store
  - Navigate to the staging/prod keys (they should look like /dsva-vagov/vets-api/staging/env_vars/vanotify/services/dmc/api_key)
  - Update them both
  - Next deploy verify that the tokens have updated in prod
  - Test the key by sending a test email in staging
