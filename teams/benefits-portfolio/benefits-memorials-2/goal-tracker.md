  - **Goal "ENG: Complete at least 5 FE Digital Dispute tickets (66% of the remaining FE tickets for the initiative)."** Due to a change in approach mid-sprint from DMC (JSON to PDF), the scope of the tickets originally pulled into the sprint changed, causing additional ticket requirements and resulting in not all of the anticipated items being closed. These are currently in progress and expected to close early in Sprint 10.
  - **Goal "ENG: Define, request and begin setup for any provided credentials from pay.gov to be added to the portal environment."** Engineering requested and began the setup process; however no credentials were able to be provided from pay.gov this sprint. The team completed their portion. However, additional work will be needed once credentials are provided.
  -   **Goal "ENG: Implement the ability to use international phone numbers in the portal."** This work is currently blocked by the Authenticated Expereince Platform team. They reported they need to update the Front End form component before we can proceed with this work.
