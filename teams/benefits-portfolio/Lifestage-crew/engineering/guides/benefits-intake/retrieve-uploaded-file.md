## Instructions
This guide is for taking a confirmation number that a user will see have seen on VA.gov and retrieving the form submission PDF / status from the Lighthouse Benefits Intake API

### Getting the `benefits_intake_uuid` via DataDog
1. Navigate to [this](https://vagov.ddog-gov.com/dashboard/s5j-ddd-kb8/benefits---income-and-assets---0969---benefits-intake?tile_focus=3106620964428565) DataDog dashboard widget:  
**NOTE:** Make sure the `env` for the dashboard and the time frame are set correctly (staging -> `eks-staging`, production -> `eks-prod`)

2. You should see a list of logs similar to the image above. The second column (outlined in **RED**) should contain a UUID that matches the confirmation number that the user would have seen on the confirmation page on VA.gov. We are interested in the `benefits_intake_uuid` (outlined in **BLUE**) as that will allow us to retrieve the form submission PDF / status from Lighthouse

### Retrieving submission information from Lighthouse Benefits Intake
**NOTE:** You will need an API key for the Lighthouse Benefits Intake API. If you don't have one already, you can get a new one [here](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/benefits-intake/sandbox-access)

#### Current host mapping (as of 07/25/2025)  
**NOTE:** This may be out of date, so if you get a corrupted ZIP back, it's possible the host needs to be updated
- VA.gov Staging: `sandbox-api.va.gov`
- VA.gov Production: `api.va.gov`

#### Retrieving the form PDF
1. Open a terminal
2. Enter the following command (make sure to replace the variables wrapped in `{` with the correct values):  
**NOTE:** Make sure that the host (eg. `sandbox-api.va.gov`) is correct and maps to the correct one for the environment in VA.gov you are interested in

```sh
# benefits_intake_uuid: The UUID we got from DataDog column 3 (outlined in BLUE in the screenshot above)
# apikey: Your API key for use with the Lighthouse Benefits Intake API
# filename: This is the name that the ZIP will assume when it's saved to your computer
curl -X GET 'https://sandbox-api.va.gov/services/vba_documents/v1/uploads/{benefits_intake_uuid}/download' \
  --header 'apikey: {apikey}' \
  --header 'accept: application/zip' \
  > {filename}.zip
```

#### Retrieving the current status of the submission
1. Open a terminal
2. Enter the following command (make sure to replace the variables wrapped in `{` with the correct values):  
**NOTE:** Make sure that the host (eg. `sandbox-api.va.gov`) is correct and maps to the correct one for the environment in VA.gov you are interested in

```sh
# benefits_intake_uuid: The UUID we got from DataDog column 3 (outlined in BLUE in the screenshot above)
# apikey: Your API key for use with the Lighthouse Benefits Intake API
curl -X GET 'https://sandbox-api.va.gov/services/vba_documents/v1/uploads/{benefits_intake_uuid}' \
  --header 'apikey: {apikey}' \
  --header 'accept: application/json'
```

#### Retrieving the form submission JSON payload
1. In a browser, navigate to:
   - Staging: https://argocd.vfs.va.gov/applications/vets-api-staging
   - Production: https://argocd.vfs.va.gov/applications/vets-api-prod

|-

2. Mouse over one of the green boxes with a white checkmark and you should see a popup:

|-

3. Each green box represents a node that is running for the vets-api application. You will want to find a node that starts with either `vets-api-web` or `vets-api-sidekiq` as those node types will give you access to a rails console

4. Once you find a node running the correct process, click the green box and then click `Exec` from the popup menu

|-

5. In the command line on the terminal, enter the following: `bundle exec rails console --sandbox`
6. Once the rails console loads, type the following command: `IncomeAndAssets::SavedClaim.find_by(guid: {confirmation_number}).form` (make sure to replace `{confirmation_number}` with the actual confirmation number
7. This should give you the form submission JSON

|-

8. If you want to clean up the formatting, copy the output from the rails console and open a console in your browser. You can then type `JSON.parse()` and insert the JSON output you copied earlier in between the opening and closing parenthesis. This should return the JSON in a more recognizable format that you can then copy
