# [DRAFT] OCTO Benefits Portfolio Lifestage Enablement Team Charter
---
Welcome to the OCTO Lifestage Enablement Team Charter! We wrote this as a way to align as an Enablement team and with the product delivery teams we work with.  Our aim is that this is a living document that provides a reference point of how we see our role, responsibilities, and ways of working. As always, feel free to ask us questions.

## How we work
### Very important things to keep in mind
- Be thoughtful, generous, respectful. 
- Every single person on this team is here for the right reasons and we aim to promote collaborative and supportive culture.
- No mansplaining. No cutting other people off.
- Assume past decisions by OCTO teams were made thoughtfully and with difficult tradeoffs in mind. Everything is harder than you think it should be so we're often forced to go with the least shitty solution. However, new people often bring a wonderful new perspective so don't hesitate to ask questions -- just approach from a neutral and inquisitive place. Alex Talyor's rule of thumb = if you find yourself thinking "why don't we just...", it's probably time to adjust your attitude. And remember, one day you'll be the old timer on the team that some new person is wondering why _you_ did some weird thing!



### Enablement Team working with contract product delivery teams
- We (enablement team) focus on outcomes not outputs, and we avoid being prescriptive wherever possible.
- We respect teams as self-managing teams that have their own internal processes and cultural norms.
- We guide high level strategy and support decision-making that takes into consideration the greater VA ecosystem. Especially VA.gov.
- We support the relationship with VBA with a focus on using requirements as guideposts, but recognize that it's our responsibility to infuse HCD and modern development practices into the end-to-end service design.
- Ensure what we design and develop iterative solutions that work towards the long-term goals _(TBD)_ of the product and organization.
- We recognize that the VA is HUGE and we're here to help navigate it.

### What the Enablement Team expects from contract delivery teams
We expect you to feel ownership of your work, your products, and deliver high quality work.


**Vision, strategy** _(TBD)_

* Determine the product direction and goals in collaboration with the enablement team. 

* Work with the team to create a high-level, agile, roadmap that is manageable and realistic 

* This looks like 

  * Collaborate regularly with Enablement team and team members to define roadmap priorities 

  * Define and document OKRs with the team 

  * Review OKRs against product direction and goals to determine if the product needs to pivot strategy or direction
 
  * Keep VBA informed of strategy and ensure that their needs are reflected on the roadmap. 

**Prioritization** _(TBD)_
* Prioritization should be based on the Benefits Portfolio prioritization framework and data.
* Contract delivery team owns product delivery prioritization process.
* Enablement team provides timely guidance on priorities, goals, and desired outcomes.


**Managing up, stakeholders (enablement team and at times, VBA)** 

* Practice leads should take responsibility for ensuring alignment of high level strategy with enablement team and the greater delivery team.

* Resolve or escalate blockers that impede the success of the team, involving (or deferring) the team as needed 

* Defend product decisions using evidence gained from research or analysis 

* Lead stakeholder relationship strategy and cultivate key relationships 

* Explain technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences 

* Influence without authority 

* This looks like 

  * Participate in user research and invite stakeholders to observe 

  * Make sure each team member and stakeholder are aware of the expectations and are set up to succeed 

  * Gain commitments from leaders and team members who are not direct reports 

**Team leadership** 

* Motivate individuals to form cohesive teams 

* Lead the team to stay on track for delivery while prioritizing team health 

* Reduce or eliminate unnecessary government bureaucracy to create a healthy and productive environment for teams to focus on shipping products over processes. 

* This looks like 

  * Maintain a bias towards action by understanding the current work and actively anticipating and preparing for future work. 

  * Enable cross-functional teams to work together effectively by empowering them to do their best work and protecting them from unproductive external demands 

  * Continuously ask yourself, “What problem are we trying to solve?” and then ensure the team is focused on delivering a minimum viable product 

  * Don’t make the perfect the enemy of the good
 
**Communication & documentation**

* In general, default to text-based tools for internal communications for ease of finding and updating (ie. choose github markdown over Word files and PPTs; only use slack posts for temporary or private docs)

* Aim for a medium level of documentation (not exhaustive and not minimal). Document key information that will be useful to our future selves and our wonderful future team members who may need to look back to understand project goals, key research findings, what areas need additiona attention, why we made some weird decision, etc. 

* Leave things better than how you found them (it’s everyone’s responsibility to improve documentation).

* Communication goals: transparancy now, paper trail for future version of the team

* All communication about the work should be done in OCTO slack, defaulted to public channels. This greatly helps teams keep a pulse on the work.

  * Slack
  -  use for conversations (threads for micro convos)
  -  Only use DMs when it truly needs to be private or you’re just working out logistics for a meeting or something no one else needs to see
  -  Channels shouldn't be private 
  *  Github
  -  most of your work (or requests to others for work) should be connected to an issue or product folder
  -  Decisions made in slack conversations should be documented in GH
  -  Planning, notes, documentation should be in an md file
  -  Research documentation and design decisions should be stored in appropriate research folder within product folder. 
  -  Cross-link any research to the research history
  * Email
  -  Ideally only used when communicating with people outside the OCTO team, such as VBA

*** **Note: all 3 above communication tools are subject to FOIA**


### How we prioritize
- We set priorities based on Veteran impact. 
- We recognize that sometimes there are "emergencies" in policy and/or tech in which case we document the ideal state, and make concrete plans to come back to it.
- We identify the ideal. When we skip steps, the reason should be documented with a plan to followup in place.

Reference: [Benefits Prioritization Framework](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1705375308356/7e8c7aa4102f88511e577cf51f9092cc1f8bba8a?sender=u67935c4c785a0d511b462873)

### How we solve problems
The problem we name is the problem we solve. As such, we aim to:
- Solve problems at their root
- Ensure we are solving the right problem- signals are backed by multiple sources (Veteran research, analytics, SMEs, etc)
- We make testable hypotheses, measure the results, and iterate.


### Workflow + Cadence
1. We work async and in two week sprints. We do not want "reactive" work and as such we work better if meetings are planned at least a week in advance (we recognize that's not always possible).
2. Meetings have clear goals, facilitation, and documentation of decisions.
3. It is important to remember that the Enablement team isn't a member of the delivery team, and since we function as the client:
-  Strategies should be approved with enablement team before work begins.
-  Final work products should be reviewed internally first.
-  We can work with you at any stage, but there should be a shared understanding of what stage we are at. We should be clear on if we are looking at a final product or a work in progress.
-  If we say something to one team member, we expect that is communicated to the team. Again, defaulting to public channels makes this easy.


### VBA Relationships
We greatly value and respect our VBA counterparts. They have a wealth of knowledge about the Benefits services, policies, and processees. 
- We respect their time and do as much background research as we can on our own, and we faciliate meetings with clear goals, agendas, and decision-making.
- We provide high level expertise and don't directly implement requirements without proper research, data, and strategy. This is why we are here, and our responsibility.
- We keep them informed of our roadmap and we have a clear understanding of their priorities. 

## How we Product
**Product strategy, vision** 

* Proactively understand Enablement Team’s high-level vision and transform it into detailed action plans 

* Ensure the team understands the direction and goals of the product or service so they can deliver towards it 

* Provide feedback to the Enablement team about the viability and accuracy of strategy, measures of success, when additional user research is needed, and long-term roadmap 

* This looks like 

   * Organize the team to incrementally deliver on product direction and goals  

   * Facilitate workshops, Product Lead check-ins, and other discussions to align the team around priorities, goals, scope, and strategies 

   * Include the Enablement team in agile ceremonies so they can provide their perspectives

**Prioritization, planning** 

* Create short-term roadmaps by planning and scoping the size of the effort and resources required to achieve goals (2-3 months) 

* Ensure the team is clear on what to work on now and next (in alignment with the roadmaps) 

* Communicate relative priorities of items within each sprint 

* This looks like 

   * Manage the product backlog, board, and associated agile processes 

   * Manage the team on a day-to-day basis, including by leading agile and scrum team meetings and ceremonies 

   * Cross-team planning (like PI planning) with stakeholders, middleware, API, and backend teams 

**Managing up, stakeholders** 

* Escalate blockers that impede the success of the team to the Enablement team, or directly with stakeholders if agreed with Enablement team. 

* Summarize the outcomes and impact of product initiatives on Veterans or other users, our tech stack, and VA programs 

* This looks like 

   * Elevate dependencies or other impacts to your team and Product Lead 

   * Represent the team by presenting at impact reviews, Team of Teams, and other cross-team touch points

 **Product leadership** 

* Lead product discovery with a cross-functional team 

* Coordinate and communicate decisions clearly – both in and outside of the team 

* Advocate for the user’s needs and outcomes in collaboration with designers, researchers 

* Define and incorporate relevant KPIs into product decision-making 

* This looks like 

   * Work with research teammates to articulate user research goals 

   * Create actionable and prioritized user stories 

   * Being the eyes and ears of the team and your Product Lead at Team of Teams 

   * Make informed decisions so that the team can continue to move forward 

   * Building pre-launch checklists and ensuring they’re completed 

   * Make sure that individual team members own the portion of the Collab Cycle they best align to. For example, designer for Design Intent Review or engineer for Privacy & Security Review


## How we UX

### In general
- Design, research, content, accessibility should be integrated from the very beginning
- Bring  team along with you on your process (don't design in a bubble and toss over the wall to devs)
- Always be asking
  - Ask WHY all the time
  - State the problems. Articulate assumptions then validate them
  - Strive to solve the deeper problem
- Always be improving
  - “Only make new mistakes” - Weaver
  - Be open to critique of your own work and processes. Critique makes things better!
  - Contribute to critique of other people's work (help other people improve)
  - If you don't know how to do something, what to do next, how to solve a problem -- Ask! You're awesome, but you're not expected to know everything.
  - Our work is iterative
  - Our teams are iterative
- Look for the story in everything we do (for stakeholders, ourselves, and potential medium posts)

- [Vets.gov Playbook](https://www.vets.gov/playbook/) (but it REALLY needs to be updated)
- [Software and tools list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/design-resources/designtools.md)

### Research & Discovery
- There's no magic formula for doing research but it often (sort of) looks like this:
    - [Discovery Sprint](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/discovery-sprints/how-to-run-discovery-sprint.md) to get the lay of the land and jump start your project.
    - Analytics when there are existing/comparable systems
    - Comparative analysis
    - Baseline testing of any existing/comparable systems
    - card sorting / tree testing
    - Early prototype testing (can be scrappy, paper-based)
    - Prototype testing or testing on staging with code 
    - UAT pre-launch
    - A/B testing with Google Optimizer post launch
    - and for all things, we aim to test with a variety of users -- including those with low-literacy, cognitive disabilities, visual impairments/assistive technology 
- One major obstacle to research is [PRA & things you may not expect](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/what-is-paperwork-reduction-act.md)

#### Secondary research
- Read user voice submissions
- Veteran forums and Facebook groups
- Contact centers
- Secretary's help line group - get access to transcripts/talk over themes
- POTUS letters
- Vet data (https://www.va.gov/vetdata/) for lots of stats on veteran use of VA services, demographics, etc.

### Design
  - Mobile-first
  - Use established design patterns when possible (sort of aligned with the US Web Design Standards)
  - Flow diagrams & maps of existing systems to document "before" AND launch discovery activities
  - Design for accessibility
  - [How to design forms for VA.gov](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/design-resources/form-design-process.md)
  
### Content
- Static content vs. Tool-based content
- UX writing & plain language (when in doubt, ask a Veteran - or five!)
- Consult your friendly content person early and often

### 508/Accessibility- [Beyond compliance](https://adhoc.team/playbook-accessibility/)
We design for all Veterans.
- Design for accessibility
- Test with screenreaders ([see VoiceOver guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/resources/mac-voiceover-guide.md) and [see cross-platform guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/resources/screenreader-testing-cross-platform.md) and ask for a demo if this is new to you)
- Consult your friendly 508 office
- Usability test for accessibility
