## Areas with Excellent Coverage (90-100%)

- Data transformation logic for accrued benefits calculation
- Form configuration and conditional dependencies across all sections
- Eligibility determination logic (already filed, unpaid creditors)
- Veteran and beneficiary identification handling
- Claimant information collection and validation
- Surviving relatives management (dynamic array handling)
- Expenses and debts tracking
- Prefill logic for both authenticated and unauthenticated users
- Page configurations and validation functions
- Routing and navigation logic
- Helper utilities

---

## Areas Below 95% (Still Above 80% Requirement)

**Overall Branches: 83.33%**
- Reason: Complex conditional logic for multiple paths (eligibility, beneficiary status, relatives, expenses)
- Impact: None - exceeds 80% requirement
- Note: Branch coverage reflects the complexity of the accrued benefits form with numerous conditional flows

**Statements: 91.93%**
- Reason: Some edge cases in optional field handling and complex transformations
- Impact: Minimal - well above 80% threshold

**Functions: 93.33%**
- Reason: A few helper functions for edge cases not fully exercised
- Impact: Minimal - exceeds requirement

- Branch coverage (83.33%) reflects the increased complexity but still exceeds platform requirements
- All critical paths are thoroughly tested with 222 total test cases
- Dynamic array handling for surviving relatives is fully covered
- Expense and debt calculation logic is validated
