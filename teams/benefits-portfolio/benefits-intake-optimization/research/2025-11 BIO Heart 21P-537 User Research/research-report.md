## **Research Goals**

This research evaluated the usability of an online version of Form 21P-537 (Marital Status Questionnaire) for surviving spouses receiving VA pension benefits. The form supports surviving spouses during critical life stages:

* **Taking Care of Myself** \- Managing ongoing VA benefits and staying up to date with requirements  
* **Retiring** \- As Veterans and their families age and transition to retirement  
* **Aging** \- Continuing to receive and maintain VA survivor benefits throughout later life stages

**Key moments this tool supports:**

* Receiving periodic verification requests from VA (8-year cycle or triggered by record changes)  
* Experiencing a change in marital status (remarriage or end of remarriage)  
* Needing to take action to maintain benefit eligibility  
* Seeking help understanding VA rules and requirements

**Outcomes we aimed to achieve:**

* Reduce confusion by providing clear, contextual information throughout the form  
* Make it easier and faster for surviving spouses to confirm their marital status  
* Help prevent benefit terminations due to missed deadlines or misunderstandings  
* Provide a more accessible online option while maintaining paper and phone alternatives

## **Research Questions**

**Goal 1: Understand the current experience with Form 21P-537**

* How do surviving spouses receive and initially react to the form?  
* What challenges do they encounter when completing and submitting it?  
* How do they track the outcome and what happens after submission?  
* Who do they turn to for help (VSO, county veterans office, VA call center)?

**Goal 2: Identify knowledge gaps about marital status requirements**

* What do surviving spouses understand about why they're receiving this form?  
* How well do they understand how remarriage affects their benefits?  
* Are they aware that benefits may be reinstated if a remarriage ends?  
* What documentation do they think they need to provide?

**Goal 3: Evaluate the value of an online version**

* Would an online option be helpful, and for whom?  
* How do they prefer to submit forms (online vs. paper vs. phone)?  
* What would they expect from an online version?  
* What barriers exist for using online forms?

## **Methodology**

We conducted **semi-structured interviews combined with usability concept testing** with 8 surviving spouses of Veterans currently receiving or who have received VA pension benefits.

**Session structure:**

1. **Warm-up questions** (5 minutes) \- Understanding their background and experience with VA forms  
2. **Prior experience discussion** (10 minutes) \- Discussing their experience with the paper Form 21P-537  
3. **Form walkthrough** (20 minutes) \- Screen-shared usability testing of the online prototype  
4. **Overall reactions** (5 minutes) \- Feedback on the online version vs. paper

**Location:** Remote via Zoom  
**Testing environment:** Staging.va.gov with test user accounts

## **Hypotheses and Conclusions**

### **Hypothesis 1: The form creates confusion or anxiety**

**"Likely True"** \- Partially validated

The paper form does create some initial confusion and anxiety, but the online version successfully addresses these concerns. Participants reported that the online form's introduction page and contextual help text made the purpose clear and reduced anxiety about benefit termination.

*Supporting evidence:*

* 6 of 8 participants mentioned uncertainty when first receiving the paper form  
* All 8 participants found the online introduction page helpful in explaining the purpose  
* Multiple participants specifically noted the timeline information (60 days) helped reduce stress  
* One participant stated: "It's clear what they're asking for and why they need it. That helps."

### **Hypothesis 2: Knowledge gaps prevent optimal benefit utilization**

**"Likely True"** \- Validated

Several participants expressed uncertainty about what constitutes a "state-recognized marriage," suggesting knowledge gaps exist. However, the online form's clear presentation of reinstatement information for Cohort 3 (those whose remarriage ended) was well-received.

*Supporting evidence:*

* 3 of 8 participants asked clarifying questions about "state-recognized marriage"  
* Multiple participants were unaware benefits could be reinstated if remarriage ends  
* Participants who saw the reinstatement information found it valuable: "I didn't know you could get benefits back. That's really important information."  
* Form terminology around "remarriage" was generally understood

### **Hypothesis 3: Digital preferences vary by user characteristics**

**"Definitely True"** \- Strongly validated

Digital preference varied significantly by age and comfort with technology. However, nearly all participants expressed that online should be an option, not the only option.

*Supporting evidence:*

* 6 of 8 participants preferred online submission for themselves  
* 2 participants were completing the form on behalf of older parents and noted: "people of my mom's generation are not that computer savvy"  
* Multiple participants emphasized: "I'd definitely want to do this online, but I know my \[parent/friend\] would need the paper version"  
* All participants agreed paper and phone options must remain available

**Task completion rate: 8 of 8 participants (100%) successfully completed the online form without assistance.**

## **Key Findings**

1. The online form was clear and straightforward, with all participants successfully completing it without assistance. Participants frequently described it as "simple," "easy to follow," and "self-explanatory."

2. Participants strongly preferred the online version over paper, citing convenience, speed, and immediate confirmation as key benefits.

3. The introduction page effectively set expectations, with participants noting it clearly explained why they were receiving the form and what would happen next.

4. Remarriage questions were generally understood, though some participants requested clarification about what constitutes a "state-recognized marriage."

5. The review page with accordion sections worked well, allowing participants to easily verify their information before submission.

6. Confusion arose around the deceased Veteran identification fields asking for either SSN or VA file number. All participants defaulted to SSN, and several expressed confusion about being asked for "the same information twice" or what VA file number meant.

7. Participants expected clear confirmation after submission and wanted the ability to download or save a copy of their completed form.

8. Several participants serving as proxies for older parents emphasized the critical need to maintain paper and phone options alongside the online form.

## **Details of Findings**

### **Finding 1: The online form was clear and straightforward**

All 8 participants successfully completed the form without assistance and described it as intuitive and easy to use.

*Supporting data:*

* **P1 (Veteran spouse, 65+):** "The usability of it, for me, was not a problem, just figuring out what needs to go where."  
* **P5 (Surviving spouse, 55-64):** "Seems pretty straightforward to me. Absolutely. Just to follow the directions."  
* **P3 (Surviving spouse, 65+):** "It's simple. I like that it tells you exactly what you need."

**Implications:** The form design successfully supports intuitive completion without requiring assistance or extensive instructions. The progressive disclosure pattern (asking for information step-by-step) worked well for all participants.

### **Finding 2: Strong preference for online submission**

6 of 8 participants expressed a clear preference for online submission over paper, citing convenience, speed, and reduced anxiety about whether the form was received.

*Supporting data:*

* **P1:** "I don't mind doing it on my computer, on my desktop, actually. I'm fine with that. I think that's probably the easier way these days."  
* **P5:** "Go online. Definitely."  
* **P7:** "Preferably, yeah, like, online form that I can submit."  
* **P4 (45-54):** "I'd much rather do this online than mail something and wonder if they got it."

**However, participants emphasized maintaining alternatives:**

* **P2 (Proxy for parent):** "people of my mom's generation are not that computer savvy... they do like simple things, but \[completing forms online\] might be challenging."

**Implications:** The online version addresses a real user need and preference, but paper and phone options remain essential for some populations, particularly older adults and those with limited digital literacy.

### **Finding 3: Introduction page effectively set expectations**

All participants found the introduction page helpful in understanding the form's purpose and requirements. Several noted it reduced anxiety about the process.

*Supporting data:*

* **P6 (55-64):** "This is good \- it tells me exactly why I'm getting this and what I need to do."  
* **P4:** "I like that it shows you what you'll need before you start. That's helpful."  
* **P8 (Proxy, 35-44):** "The 60-day timeline is right there. That's important to see upfront."

**Observed behaviors:**

* 7 of 8 participants took time to read the introduction page thoroughly before proceeding  
* Multiple participants specifically noted the "What to know before you start" section  
* Participants appreciated knowing the form would take approximately 5-10 minutes

**Implications:** The introduction page successfully addresses the "unexpected form" problem identified in the research goals. Clear communication about purpose, timeline, and requirements reduces anxiety and sets appropriate expectations.

### **Finding 4: Marriage recognition questions need clarification**

While participants generally understood the remarriage question, 3 of 8 requested additional clarity about what constitutes a "state-recognized marriage."

*Supporting data:*

* **P2:** "when it says the state must recognize your marriage, I would assume that just means you have a legal marriage, you know, so that... but they're gonna..."  
* **P4:** "Your state must recognize your marriage, okay, the state where you both lived when you got married.... who knows what the date of the letter was, okay."  
* **P6:** "So you have to do it within 60 days, the state has to recognize the marriage..."

**Confusion points:**

* What "state-recognized" means in practice (particularly for common-law marriages)  
* Whether marriages performed in other countries count  
* Whether marriages performed in one state but residence in another creates issues

**Implications:** Adding clarifying help text or examples about marriage recognition would reduce potential errors and calls to the VA help desk.

### **Finding 5: Review page accordion functionality worked well**

All participants successfully used the accordion sections to review their information, with several expressing appreciation for the organized presentation.

*Supporting data:*

* **P7:** "I like that I can expand each section to check what I entered. Makes it easy to review."  
* **P3:** "This is organized well. I can see everything before I submit."

**Observed behaviors:**

* All participants expanded at least 2-3 accordion sections to verify information  
* Multiple participants used the "Edit" buttons to test making changes  
* Participants understood they needed to expand sections to review content

**Implications:** The accordion pattern successfully balances showing all information with avoiding overwhelming users. No participant had difficulty using the accordions or finding the Edit buttons.

### **Finding 6: Desire for confirmation and documentation**

Multiple participants explicitly asked about or expected to receive confirmation after submission, and several wanted the ability to save a copy of their completed form.

*Supporting data:*

* **P1:** "I'd want something showing I submitted this. Like a confirmation number or something I can print."  
* **P4:** "Will I get an email saying they received it?"  
* **P7:** "I'd save a PDF of this if I could. Just to have for my records."

**Expectations:**

* Email confirmation immediately after submission  
* Ability to download/print a PDF of the completed form  
* Confirmation number for tracking  
* Timeline for when to expect a response from VA

**Implications:** Post-submission confirmation and documentation features should be prioritized. These address user needs for peace of mind and recordkeeping.

### **Finding 7: Confusion about requesting both SSN and VA file number for deceased Veteran**

Multiple participants expressed confusion when the form asked for the deceased Veteran's identification information, particularly the either/or requirement for Social Security number OR VA file number. Participants consistently used SSN and were confused about why the form appeared to be asking for information twice or what VA file number meant.

*Supporting data:*

* **P1 (65+, Veteran spouse):** "Where it says, or social security number, because why are you asking me again? I already just put it up there, because it is required. So, this could be, you know, re-enter VA file number, if available, or something like that."  
* **P1 continued:** "VA file number may or may not be known... for the VA file number, I would just have to go and find the paperwork for that. That would just take me, you know, a few extra minutes. But in recalling, identifying social security number is very easy."  
* **P3 (65+):** "Now, right here where it says File Number, most of the time, everything is a social security number. I just went through a discussion... they said, we don't do file numbers, we do social security numbers."  
* **P7 (55-64):** "I don't have it. I know I don't have a VA file number... File number is a social security number... it was something, a different type of number they used to identify military."  
* **P8 (35-44, proxy):** "We mostly used his social security number."  
* **P2 (Proxy for parent):** "That VA file number, from what I remember, is on paperwork... everything by your social security number at that point."

**Key confusion points:**

1. **Redundancy perception:** Participants thought they were being asked for SSN twice \- once in the survivor's information and again for the deceased Veteran  
2. **VA file number unfamiliarity:** Most participants were unfamiliar with VA file numbers or believed they were outdated/no longer used  
3. **"Must enter" language:** The hint text "You must enter either a VA file number or Social Security number" created confusion \- participants interpreted "must" to mean both were required  
4. **Finding the number:** Even when participants understood VA file number was optional, they weren't sure where to find it or if they had one

**Observed behaviors:**

* All 8 participants defaulted to using Social Security number  
* 3 participants paused and expressed confusion about the either/or requirement  
* 2 participants questioned whether VA file numbers were still being used  
* 1 participant explicitly noted confusion about being asked for "the same information" again

**Implications:** The current labeling and hint text for the identification fields creates unnecessary friction and confusion. Most surviving spouses default to SSN and are unfamiliar with VA file numbers. The form should clarify that SSN is sufficient and VA file number is truly optional, or consider whether this field pairing is necessary at all.

### **Finding 8: Paper and phone options remain essential**

Two participants who were completing the form on behalf of aging parents emphasized that digital-only would exclude important populations.

*Supporting data:*

* **P2 (Helping mother, 80+):** "My mom could never do this on her own. She'd need to call or get the paper form. A lot of people her age are like that."  
* **P8 (Helping mother, 75+):** "I'm doing this for my mom. If she had to do it herself, she'd need help or the paper version."

**Demographics noted by proxy users:**

* Parents in their 70s and 80s  
* Limited computer experience beyond basic email  
* Preference for phone assistance when available  
* Reliance on adult children for digital tasks

**Implications:** While the online form meets a significant user need, multi-channel options (online, paper, phone) must be maintained. Communications about the form should emphasize that multiple submission methods are available.

## **Additional Insights**

### **SSN is the universally familiar identifier**

All participants were immediately comfortable with and able to recall the deceased Veteran's Social Security number, while VA file number was unfamiliar or unknown. Multiple participants noted SSN as the standard identifier they've used throughout their interactions with VA.

**P1:** "Social security number was the most commonly used identifier. Social Security number, last four, and date of birth... the ease of being able to come back to social security number... Most military persons know social security number."

**P3:** "Most of the time, everything is a social security number... they said, we don't do file numbers, we do social security numbers."

This pattern suggests SSN should be the primary field with VA file number truly optional.

### **Security concerns were minimal**

When explicitly asked about security, participants expressed confidence in entering SSN on VA sites. **P8** confirmed: "I do \[feel secure\]" when asked about entering social security numbers on VA sites. No participant raised unsolicited concerns about providing SSN online.

### **Language preference: "Surviving spouse" vs. "widow"**

**P1 made a strong statement about terminology:** "official term widow, which I absolutely hate that term. I would prefer surviving spouse if it were me."

This suggests the form's use of "surviving spouse" rather than "widow/widower" is appropriate and appreciated by users.

### **Help-seeking behaviors varied by familiarity with VA**

Participants who were Veterans themselves or had significant VA experience navigated the form more confidently than those who were new to VA systems. However, all participants completed the form successfully regardless of experience level.

### **Desktop preference for form completion**

When asked about device preference, most participants preferred desktop computers over mobile devices for completing forms, citing:

* Easier typing on a full keyboard  
* Better visibility of information  
* Perceived security for sensitive information  
* More comfortable for reviewing information

### **Geographic and demographic considerations**

Rural participants (3 of 8\) noted that having an online option was particularly valuable because:

* Distance to VA facilities or VSO offices  
* Limited availability of in-person assistance  
* Reduced need to mail forms and wait for postal service

## **Recommendations**

### **1\. Launch the online form as designed**

**Priority: High**

The usability testing strongly validates the form design. All participants successfully completed the form, and feedback was overwhelmingly positive about clarity, organization, and ease of use.

*Supporting evidence:* 100% task completion rate, multiple participants describing form as "straightforward," "simple," and "easy to follow"

### **2\. Revise deceased Veteran identification fields to reduce confusion**

**Priority: High**

The either/or requirement for SSN or VA file number created significant confusion. Participants defaulted to SSN and were confused about being asked for identification information that seemed redundant or unclear.

*Supporting evidence:* All 8 participants used SSN; 3 explicitly expressed confusion about the fields; P1 stated "why are you asking me again? I already just put it up there"; multiple participants didn't know what a VA file number was or where to find it

**Recommended changes:**

**Option 1 (Preferred): Simplify to SSN-only with VA file number as truly optional**

* Make SSN the primary field with clear labeling  
* Move VA file number to an "optional" expandable section with explanation: "If you have a VA file number and prefer to use it instead of Social Security number"  
* Clarify in help text that most surviving spouses only need to provide SSN

**Option 2: Improve clarity of current either/or structure**

* Change hint text from "You must enter either..." to "Please provide one of the following:"  
* Add help text explaining: "Most people use Social Security number. VA file number is an older identification number that may appear on some VA documents."  
* Add example: "VA file numbers are typically 8 or 9 digits and start with 'C' or a number"  
* Consider adding "Where can I find this?" link for VA file number

**Option 3: Pre-fill from authentication**

* If the user is authenticated and the deceased Veteran's information is in the system, pre-populate known identifiers  
* Allow user to verify rather than manually enter

**Why this is high priority:** This confusion point affected all participants and created unnecessary friction in an otherwise smooth form experience. It's a clear opportunity to reduce cognitive load and potential errors.

### **3\. Add clarifying help text about marriage recognition**

**Priority: Medium**

Expand the help text or add examples explaining what "state-recognized marriage" means to reduce confusion and potential errors.

*Supporting evidence:* 3 of 8 participants requested clarification; questions about common-law marriages, marriages performed abroad, and interstate marriage recognition

**Suggested additions:**

* Examples of recognized marriages (ceremonial, common-law where applicable)  
* Clarification that marriages performed in other countries are recognized  
* Note that recognition is based on state of residence at time of marriage

### **4\. Implement post-submission confirmation and download features**

**Priority: High**

Add ability to download/print a PDF copy of the completed form and provide immediate email confirmation with submission details.

*Supporting evidence:* Multiple participants explicitly requested confirmation; expressed need for records; anxiety about whether submission was received

**Features to include:**

* Confirmation page with submission details  
* Email confirmation sent immediately  
* PDF download option  
* Confirmation/tracking number  
* Expected timeline for VA response

### **5\. Ensure multi-channel communication strategy**

**Priority: High**

When communicating about the new online option, clearly emphasize that paper and phone submission remain available. Target communications to help proxies understand options for those they're assisting.

*Supporting evidence:* 2 participants completing on behalf of parents noted digital literacy barriers; multiple participants emphasized importance of maintaining paper/phone options

**Communication considerations:**

* Letters should mention all submission methods equally  
* Include language specifically for proxies/caregivers  
* Provide clear instructions for obtaining paper forms or phone assistance  
* Do not present online as the default or expected method

### **6\. Expand help text about deadline implications**

**Priority: Low**

While the 60-day deadline is clear, consider adding brief information about what happens if the deadline is missed.

*Supporting evidence:* Research plan identified that missing deadlines can result in benefit termination; this information should be balanced to inform without creating undue anxiety

## **Product User and Business Outcomes**

### **Desired User Outcome**

This research supports our desired user outcome by validating that the online form successfully:

1. **Reduces confusion and anxiety** \- The introduction page, clear language, and step-by-step approach helped participants understand the purpose and feel confident completing the form  
2. **Provides faster, more convenient submission** \- Participants strongly preferred the online option over mailing paper forms  
3. **Increases confidence in receipt** \- Participants expected and valued confirmation that VA received their submission  
4. **Maintains accessibility** \- Research validated the need for multi-channel options while confirming the online form works well for digitally capable users

The 100% task completion rate and positive feedback demonstrate the form meets user needs for clarity, efficiency, and confidence in the process.

### **Desired Business Outcome**

This research supports our desired business outcome by showing that the online form will:

1. **Increase digital adoption** \- Strong user preference for online submission suggests high potential adoption rates among capable users  
2. **Reduce paper processing delays** \- Participants noted faster submission and reduced anxiety about mail delays  
3. **Prevent benefit terminations** \- Clear communication about purpose, requirements, and deadlines helps users respond timely  
4. **Reduce support burden** \- Intuitive design and clear content reduced questions and need for assistance

The research identified areas where clarification (marriage recognition) could further reduce calls to VA help desks and prevent errors.

## **Key Performance Indicators**

### **KPI 1: Improved satisfaction with web and mobile products**

This research supports measurement of this KPI by establishing a strong baseline of user satisfaction with the online form. The 100% task completion rate and overwhelmingly positive qualitative feedback ("straightforward," "easy," "clear") indicate the form will likely score high on satisfaction surveys post-launch.

**Recommendations for measuring:**

* Implement post-submission satisfaction survey  
* Track completion rates and abandonment points  
* Monitor feedback through VA channels  
* Compare satisfaction scores to paper form experience (if measurable)

### **KPI 2: 100% of transactions received via digital experiences are processed correctly**

This research supports measurement of this KPI by identifying potential error points that should be monitored:

* Marriage recognition questions (where confusion occurred)  
* Required field completeness  
* Accurate information entry

The form's clear labels, help text, and review functionality should support high success rates. The research identified where additional clarity (marriage recognition) would further reduce errors.

**Recommendations for measuring:**

* Track submission error rates  
* Monitor incomplete submissions  
* Track VA processing errors related to form completion  
* Monitor help desk calls about form completion

## **Next Steps**

1. **Implement priority recommendations** (Target: Pre-launch)

   * Add marriage recognition clarification help text  
   * Implement post-submission confirmation and PDF download  
   * Develop multi-channel communication materials  
2. **Prepare for launch** (Target: 30 days)

   * Finalize form based on research findings  
   * Create user documentation and help resources  
   * Develop training materials for VA staff  
   * Prepare monitoring and analytics plan  
3. **Conduct post-launch evaluation** (Target: 90 days after launch)

   * Review analytics and completion rates  
   * Analyze help desk calls and error patterns  
   * Collect user feedback through surveys  
   * Monitor satisfaction metrics  
4. **Plan accessibility testing** (Target: 60 days after launch)

   * Recruit participants who use assistive technology  
   * Test with screen readers and magnification software  
   * Validate keyboard navigation  
   * Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance in practice
