## **Intro - 5 minutes**

Hello, my name is **[Andrea]**, and I'm going to walk you through today's session. As you know from our invitation, my office is working with VA to improve online forms for surviving spouses. Joining us on the call are **[NOTETAKER NAME]** and a couple of other colleagues who would like to observe and take notes.

I'd like to begin by thanking you for making time to speak with us. Your feedback is valuable and will help us determine if this online form works as intended. Just to confirm, we'd like to keep this session to **45 minutes**. Does that still work for you?

Great. If you need a break or to stop at any time, please let me know.

During this session, I'll start by asking you a few questions about your experience with VA forms. Later on, I'll ask you to share your screen and try out a prototype of an online form we're working on.

**Please be aware that there are no wrong answers.** In fact, this is probably the one place today where you don't have to worry about making mistakes! As you go about using the form, I'll ask you to think aloud as much as possible: to describe what you're looking at and what you're trying to do. This will be a big help.

Also, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the form, so we need to hear your honest reactions.

If you have any questions as we go along, just ask. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we're interested in how people do when they don't have someone sitting next to them to help. But if you still have any questions when we're done, I'll try to answer them then.

**A few things about privacy and recording:**

- We'll be discussing your experiences with VA benefits and possibly your marital status. I understand these topics can be personal. You're welcome to share only what you're comfortable with, and you can skip any question at any time.
- With your permission, I'd like to record this call. The recording will only be used to help us figure out how to improve the site, and it won't be seen by anyone except those with a need-to-know. Recording this call also helps me because I don't have to take as many notes. **Is that okay?** **[Record answer here]**
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session to help our VA partners understand experiences like yours?** We blur out any information that could identify you. These clips are only shared within VA to help improve our digital products. We don't know yet if we'll use a clip, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll confirm this is still okay with you. **Does that work for you?** **[Record answer here]**
- If yes: **Once I start recording, I'll confirm one more time that you're okay with it.**

## **Warm-up Questions - 3 minutes**

Before we look at the form, I'd like to hear a little bit about you and how you usually interact with VA.
