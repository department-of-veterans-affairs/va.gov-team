## **Background**

**What problem is your product trying to solve?**

Form 21P-537 (Marital Status Questionnaire) is currently a paper-only form that VA sends to surviving spouses receiving pension benefits. VA uses this form to verify that surviving spouses still meet eligibility requirements, as marital status can affect benefit entitlement.

The current process presents several challenges:

- **The form is often unexpected.** Surviving spouses receive it as part of an 8-year periodic review or when triggered by record changes, which can be confusing.
- **There's limited guidance.** The form doesn't clearly explain reinstatement rules if a remarriage ends, potentially causing confusion.
- **Paper creates delays.** Paper processing may be slower than needed for time-sensitive status changes.
- **Missing deadlines has consequences.** If surviving spouses don't respond in time, their benefits may be terminated.

**We're creating an online version to:**

- Reduce confusion by providing clear, contextual information throughout the form
- Make it easier and faster for surviving spouses to confirm their marital status
- Help prevent benefit terminations due to missed deadlines or misunderstandings
- Provide a more accessible option while maintaining paper and phone alternatives

**Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)**

**This will be an authenticated experience on VA.gov, likely accessible through:**

- My VA dashboard
- The Pension and Survivor Benefits section
- Direct links sent in VA communications about marital status verification
- VA Form Finder

Surviving spouses will need to sign in to complete the form online.

**What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?**

**This is a new product.** While Form 21P-537 has existed as a paper form, there's currently no online version. Surviving spouses may be familiar with receiving the paper form in the mail, but have not had the option to complete it digitally.

However, we need to understand:

- How familiar surviving spouses are with the purpose and requirements of this form
- Whether they've used other VA online forms successfully
- What their expectations would be for an online version

### [**OCTO-DE Priorities**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md)

Objective 1: VA's digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.

**Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.

- *By creating a clearer, more accessible online option for Form 21P-537, we can improve the experience for surviving spouses who need to verify their marital status.*

**Key Result 3:** 100% of transactions received via our digital experiences are either processed correctly or we have notified the user of an error.

- *An online form will provide immediate confirmation of submission and clearer error handling compared to the current paper process.*

### [**Veteran Journey**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/508%20compliant%20Journey%20Map.md)

*Where does your product fit into the Veteran journey? Are there moments that matter?*

**This product supports surviving spouses during these life stages:**

- **Taking Care of Myself** - Managing ongoing VA benefits and staying up to date with requirements
- **Retiring** - As Veterans and their families age and transition to retirement
- **Aging** - Continuing to receive and maintain VA survivor benefits throughout later life stages

**Moments that matter:**

- Receiving periodic verification requests from VA
- Experiencing a change in marital status (remarriage or end of remarriage)
- Needing to take action to maintain benefit eligibility
- Seeking help understanding complex VA rules and requirements

## **Research Goals** 

What are you trying to learn from this research?

**Understand the current experience with Form 21P-537**

- Learn how surviving spouses receive, interpret, and complete the current paper form
- Identify pain points, areas of confusion, and barriers to timely completion
- Understand what happens after submission and how surviving spouses track outcomes

**Identify knowledge gaps that need to be addressed**

- Clarify what surviving spouses understand about how marital status affects benefits
- Learn whether they're aware of remarriage rules and reinstatement eligibility
- Understand their expectations around required documentation

**Evaluate the value proposition of an online version**

- Determine whether an online option would be helpful and for whom
- Understand preferences for submission methods (online vs. paper vs. phone)
- Identify which aspects of the process could most benefit from being online

### **Outcome**

How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

**This research will help us:**

1. **Design better content** that clearly explains:
   - Why surviving spouses are receiving this form
   - How marital status affects benefits
   - What reinstatement means and when it applies
   - What happens after submission
2. **Create better information architecture** by understanding:
   - What information needs to be provided upfront
   - What guidance is needed at each step
   - How to structure the form for clarity
3. **Make informed decisions** about:
   - What features are most important to include
   - How to balance digital and traditional submission methods
   - What support resources to provide
4. **Identify additional metrics** for measuring success based on what matters most to surviving spouses

### **Research questions**

**Goal 1: Understand the current experience with Form 21P-537**

- How do surviving spouses receive and initially react to the form?
- What challenges do they encounter when completing and submitting it?
- How do they track the outcome and what happens after submission?
- Who do they turn to for help (VSO, county veterans office, VA call center)?

**Goal 2: Identify knowledge gaps about marital status requirements**

- What do surviving spouses understand about why they're receiving this form?
- How well do they understand how remarriage affects their benefits?
- Are they aware that benefits may be reinstated if a remarriage ends?
- What documentation do they think they need to provide?

**Goal 3: Evaluate the value of an online version**

- Would an online option be helpful, and for whom?
- How do they prefer to submit forms (online vs. paper vs. phone)?
- What would they expect from an online version?
- What barriers exist for using online forms?

### **Hypotheses**

### **1: The form creates confusion or anxiety**

We believe surviving spouses don't anticipate receiving Form 21P-537 and don't fully understand its purpose. The lack of clear guidance about what happens after submission creates uncertainty. Deadline concerns may cause stress about losing benefits.

### **2: Knowledge gaps prevent optimal benefit utilization**

We believe many surviving spouses don't understand the full impact of remarriage on benefits. They may not know about reinstatement eligibility, potentially missing opportunities to restore benefits. Confusion about terms like "remarriage" may lead to incorrect responses.

### **3: Digital preferences vary by user characteristics**

We believe an online version will be valuable for digitally comfortable surviving spouses (those who regularly use online banking, email, and have completed VA forms online). However, it may not be preferred by older adults (65+) or those with lower digital literacy (limited experience with computers or smartphones). Paper and phone options will remain essential for some user groups.

## **Methodology**

**We'll conduct semi-structured interviews combined with usability concept testing.** This approach will allow us to:

1. **Explore their current experience** through open-ended conversation about:
   - How they've interacted with Form 21P-537 or marital status verification
   - Their understanding of requirements and rules
   - Challenges they've faced
   - How they get help when needed
2. **Evaluate online form** by showing:
   - Examples of how information might be presented
   - Potential form interactions
   - Guidance and help text options
   - Confirmation and next steps

## **Recruitment**

**Intended audience:** Surviving spouses of Veterans who are currently receiving VA pension benefits (Survivors Pension or Dependency and Indemnity Compensation) and have experience with Form 21P-537 or periodic marital status verification.

**Recruitment strategy:** We'll use a lean maximum variation approach with **3 cohorts** based on marital status scenarios to ensure we capture diverse experiences:

- **Cohort 1:** Surviving spouses who have not remarried (4 participants, at least 2 age 57+)
- **Cohort 2:** Surviving spouses who have remarried and are currently married (3 participants, at least 2 age 57+)
- **Cohort 3:** Surviving spouses who remarried and the marriage ended, with potential for pension reinstatement (3 participants, at least 2 age 57+)

**Inclusive research strategies:**

- Digital literacy: Mix of comfort levels with technology and online forms
- Geographic diversity: Participants from different regions of the United States
- Support network diversity: Include those who work with VSOs, county offices, and those who navigate independently

### **Recruitment criteria**

**Note to Perigean:** Please recruit surviving spouses who meet the criteria below. All participants must be a surviving spouse who have either received or are currently receiving VA pension benefits. Ideally they have recent experience with marital status verification and are over the age of 57.

- Dependents (surviving spouses): **10**
- Total recruited: **15** (1.5x buffer)
- Ideal completed sessions: **10**

### **Primary criteria (must-haves)**

**All participants must meet these criteria:**

1. **Currently receiving VA survivor benefits**

2. **Experience with Form 21P-537 or marital status verification**
   - Screener: "Have you received Form 21P-537 (also called the Marital Status Questionnaire) from VA in the past 2 years? OR Have you received other requests from VA to verify or confirm your marital status?"
   - Qualifying response: Yes to either option
3. **Distribution across marital status scenarios**
   - **Cohort 1 (4 participants):** Screener: "Since you became eligible for VA survivor benefits, have you remarried?" → Qualifying response: No
   - **Cohort 2 (3 participants):** Screener: "Since you became eligible for VA survivor benefits, have you remarried?" → Qualifying response: Yes, and I'm currently married
   - **Cohort 3 (3 participants):** Screener: "Since you became eligible for VA survivor benefits, have you remarried, and has that marriage ended?" → Qualifying response: Yes, I remarried and that marriage has ended
4. **Digital literacy diversity**
   - Screener: "How comfortable are you using websites or apps to complete forms online?"
   - Include mix: At least 4 who answer "Very comfortable," at least 4 who answer "Somewhat comfortable," and at least 3 who answer "Not very comfortable" or "I prefer paper"

#### **Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**

**These criteria would strengthen our results:**

1. **Experience with support services**
   - Include at least 3 participants who have worked with a VSO, county veterans office, or similar organization
