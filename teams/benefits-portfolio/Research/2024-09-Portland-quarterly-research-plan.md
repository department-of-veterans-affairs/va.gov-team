Research Plan for 2024-09 Veteran Benefits Experience
=====================================================

Background
----------

The Benefits Portfolio crews work on Veteran-facing benefits products such as disability compensation & Veterans Pension claims, decision review forms, and Claim Status Tool. Crews are currently looking forward and prioritizing initiatives to support OCTO OKRs and Portfolio goals. This research supports that decision-making.

### OCTO Priorities

This research supports OCTO's objective: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran Journey

Benefits portfolio products touch all aspects of the [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf).

Research Goals
--------------

The Portfolio will use this research to

-   Describe moments high-impact moments in Veterans' experience claiming benefits

-   Identify aspects of the online claims process that impact Veteran trust, confidence, and satisfaction with VA and VA benefits

-   Ground ourselves by interacting directly with people whom we serve

### Outcome

This research will help the Benefits Portfolio build a strategy for meeting OCTO's goal of improving customer satisfaction by 5%, as well as help members of the portfolio who have less day-to-day involvement with research to be more grounded in Veteran experience.

### Research questions

Research questions include:

-   How do Veterans describe their benefits journey? Which aspects stand out as the biggest pain points or bright spots?

-   How do Veterans get advice or help filing a claim for VA benefits?

-   How do Veteran's interactions with VA, and VA tools like VA.gov, engender or degrade their sense of trust in VA?

-   [Conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/benefits-portfolio/Research/2024-09-Portland-quarterly-discussion-guide.md)

### Hypothesis

This is open-ended research, so we're not testing any specific hypotheses. However, we expect to find that confidence and trust are built in part by the following:

-   Being transparent

-   Setting clear expectations and then meeting them

-   Being timely

-   Appearing to act in support of Veterans receiving benefits, not appearing to look for ways to deny Veterans their benefits

Methodology
-----------

The team will be conducting in-person interviews in the Portland, Oregon regional office. We'll be separated in a large room or in adjacent break out rooms, with each Veteran talking with two researchers.

-   Two sessions

-   Each session is 1 hour 30 mins (actual research time approximately 45-60 mins)

-   3-4 Veterans per session (plus 2 alternates)

### Location

Sessions will be in-person, at the Portland Regional Office.

-   Address: 100 SW Main St, Portland, OR 97204

-   Point of contact: Julie Strothman, <julie.strothman@va.gov> (phone number to be supplied by email)

-   Equipment used for research: Researcher laptop for taking notes

Instructions for entry: Please go to the lobby and look for a sign that says "OCTO Website Research" and has an octopus on it. You'll be escorted to our training room for the interview session and will need to go through a metal detector at security. Bring an ID just in case. You should expect to spend about 45-60 minutes total talking with VA's website research team.

Recruitment
-----------

### Recruitment approach

We will recruit Veterans using Perigean's services.

### Recruitment criteria

-   Recruit 10 Veterans for this study:

-   Session 1: 4 Veterans + 1 alternate

-   Session 2: 4 Veterans + 1 alternate

Primary criteria (must-haves)

-   50% of participants should be 44 or under.

-   All participants should have applied for disability or pension benefits in the past 3 years OR be planning to apply for either in the next year. Ideally we would have an even mix of pension and disability.

-   50% of participants are non-caucasian

Secondary criteria (nice-to-have)

-   50% of participants have worked with an accredited representative

The team is willing to be flexible on these criteria based on recruiting difficulty (in-person/time of day); please ask. In addition, we ask that Perigean confirm that participants can be expected to not travel more than 45 mins to the regional office.

Screener questions

1.  Have you applied for pension benefits from the VA within the past 3 years? Yes [attempt to recruit at 2-4 who answer yes] No

2.  Have you applied for disability compensation benefits from the VA within the past 3 years? Yes [attempt to recruit at 5-7 who answer yes] No

3.  Do you plan to file a pension or disability claim in the next 1 year? Yes [Maximum of 3 participants] No
4.  Have you worked with an accredited representative on your benefits claim? Yes No Not sure

All participants must answer Yes to at least one of the questions to qualify.

Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)

-   Mix of education-level
