# Conversation Guide 
OCTO off-site, June 6, 2024

## Introductions (1 min)
[Here’s a suggestion, you can adapt this to make it comfortable for you, just keep it short]

Hello! My name is [moderator name] and this is my colleague [colleague name]. We work on benefits projects at the VA. We are visiting Denver and wanted to take the opportunity to talk to some Veterans in the community about their experiences applying for benefits, which is why we asked you here today. Thank you for joining us! 
Before we start, we want to check in and see how you are doing and if you need anything (water, offer a snack, etc.)?

## About the session (4 mins)
Before we get started a few things I want to mention:
- This session should take about 45 minutes. We’ll be focusing on your experiences with applying for benefits with the VA.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions and experiences. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We welcome your feedback. We won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- Your participation is completely voluntary. If for any reason you want to stop, or do not want to answer a question, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete today.
- During today's interview, we may discuss experiences that have caused serious frustration. I do want to know about those experiences in case there are processes we can improve in the future, but they are not experiences I can help with directly. I don’t have any access to your claim information and can’t impact your benefits in any way; our discussion is meant to help us do better in the future, though.

Any questions before we begin?

## Benefits experience (25-30 mins)
Let’s get started, then!

### Background
Can you tell us which branch of service you were in?
- How long were you in the service?
- When did you separate?
- We understand that you applied for either disability or pension benefits sometime in the last 3 or so years, is that correct?
- If they do not offer on their own, ask them which one and how long ago they applied
- Was that the first time you applied for [benefit]? If not, about how many times have you applied?

### Veteran's story
Tell us about the steps you took to apply [the last time] and how that experience was for you… 

[The goal is to have them tell the story of their process. Listen for how they describe the steps and what stands out in their memory. Then you can ask follow-ups to fill in any details you would like to know about.]

Possible prompts to support storytelling:
- How did you start?
- What happened next?
- Can you tell me more about that?
- Why was that?
- Can you give me an example of that?

Additional details to ask about if not discussed:
- What motivated you decide to file for benefits?
- How did you apply? [Looking for online, paper form faxed or mailed, VSO submitted, etc.]
- Did anyone help you with the application? [VSO, battle buddy, etc.] What was the most valuable help they gave you?
- How long did it take between the time you decided you wanted to file and when you actually submitted the application? What did you have to do during that time? Did you do any preparation before filling out the claim? If yes, what did you do?
- Do you remember if you had any trouble with any parts of the application? If yes, which areas? What was difficult about them?
- Do you remember what evidence or documentation you had to provide? How was that experience?
- Did you have top take any actions after you submitted the form but before you got the decision?
- Do you remember what it was like waiting for your decision? How long did it take you to get your decision? What kind of status communication did you receive? What were you hoping for?
- Did your claim work out the way you were hoping or expecting? Why or why not?

### Evidence
Do you remember what evidence or documentation you provided with your claim? If so, what did you provide? [get a list... options for disability could include DD-214, military personnel records, millitary service treatment/medical records, private doctor medical records, buddy statements, personal statements]
- How did you know what VA needed from you?
- How did you decide what to include [i.e., all or parts of a medical record, VA versus private?
- Did you submit anything with the claim itself?
- Were you asked by VA to follow-up with any other evidence?
- How was that part of the experience overall?


## Trust and satisfaction (10 mins)

Were there any moments in this benefits application process where you felt VA was building trust with you? 
- Please tell me more about those moments…
- What was it that helped build trust?

Any times where you felt like this process was breaking your trust? 
- Please tell me more about that…
- What was it that eroded your trust?
- What would have needed to happen for VA to not break your trust?

Do you remember how confident you felt about your application when you submitted it? 
- What was the cause of that feeling?
- Did your feeling of confidence change over the process?

Do you feel that the VA appropriately set expectations for the process?
- Why or why not?
- What do you wish they had told you?

If you had to rate your satisfaction with your benefits experience on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being Not at all satisfied and 5 being very satisfied, what would you say?
- Tell us a bit more about why you answered [number]…

If you could wave a magic wand and change anything about the benefits process what would you change?
- How would that help you?

## Wrap-up (5 mins)
That’s all the questions we had for you… 
- Is there anything on your mind that you would like to share with us or any questions you have?

It’s been a pleasure talking with you! Thank you for sharing your stories and insights with us today. We'll take you downstairs.

## Watch for distress
If you feel that your participant is getting distressed, take a pause. Here are some things you can say.

- “I’m sorry to hear you’ve been going through this. I appreciate your willingness to speak to me today.
- “I’m interested to hear more about [topic]. Are you up for continuing, or would you prefer me to move to the next topic?
- “I don’t have concrete help I can offer, but I do have a hotline number and online resources I can provide. Before we continue, would you like that information?
