# Research Plan for 2024-06 Veteran Benefits Experience

## Background
The Benefits Portfolio crews work on Veteran-facing benefits products such as the 526-EZ for disability compensation claims, 0995 for decision reviews, and the 527-EZ for pension. Crews are currently looking forward and prioritizing new initiatives to support OCT and portfolio goals. This research is in support of that decision-making.

### OCTO Priorities 
This research supports OCTO's "Better Experiences" goal for 2024.

### Veteran Journey
Benefits portfolio products touch all aspects of the [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf). 

## Research Goals	
The portfolio will be using this research to
- Build on its' understanding of the overal benefits delivery experience, and in particular, the role of evidence in their claim
- Better understand what impacts Veteran trust, confidence, and satisfaction with the VA and VA benefits
- Rebuild its in-person research practice

### Outcome
The outcome of the research will help the portfolio build a strategy for meeting OCTO's goals of improving customer satisfaction by 5%, as well as help members of the portfolio who have less day-to-day involvement with research to be more grounded in Veteran experience. 

### Research questions
Research questions include:
- How do Veterans describe their benefits journey? Which aspects stand out as the biggest pain points or bright spots?
- How do Veteran's interactions with the VA, and VA tools like va.gov, engender or degrade their sense of trust in the VA?
- What evidence did they provide with their claim? What was their experience with gathering and sending or uploading their evidence?
- [Conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/benefits-portfolio/Research/2024-06-Denver-Quarterly-DiscussionGuide.md) 

### Hypothesis
This is open-ended research, so we are not testing any specific hypotheses. However, we expect to find that confidence and trust are built in part by the following:
- Being transparent
- Setting clear expectations and then meeting them
- Being timely
- Appearing to be acting in support of Veterans, not appearing to be looking for ways to deny Veterans from their benefits.

## Methodology	
The team will be conducting **in-person** interviews in the Denver regional office. We'll be separated in a larger training room or in adjacent break out rooms, with each Veteran attended by two researchers. 
- Each session is 1 hour 30 mins (actual research time approximately 45-60 mins)
- 3-4 Veterans per session (plus 2 alternates), 2 sessions

### Location
Sessions will be **in-person**, at the *Denver Regional Office*.
- Address: 155 Van Gordon Street, Lakewood, CO 80228
- Point of contact: Shannon Ford, shannon.ford1@va.gov, 847-372-4519
- Equipment used for research: none

Instructions for entry: Please go to the lobby and look for a sign that says "OCTO Research" and has an octopus on it. You will be escorted to our training room for the research session and will need to go through a metal detector at security. Bring an ID just-in-case. You should expect to spend about 45-60 minutes total talking with VA's research team.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
We will recruit Veterans using Perigean's services.

### Recruitment criteria
- Recruit 9 Veterans for this study:
- Session 1: 4 Veterans + 1 alternate
- Session 2: 3 Veterans + 1 alternate

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
- 50% of participants should be 44 or under.
- All participants should have applied for disability or pension benefits in the past 3 years OR be planning to apply for either in the next year. Ideally we would have an even mix of pension and disability.
- 50% of participants are non-caucasian

The team is willing to be flexible on these criteria based on recruiting difficulty (in-person/time of day); please ask.
In addition, we ask that Perigean confirm that participants can be expected to not travel more than 45 mins to the regional office.

**Screener questions** 
1. Have you applied for pension benefits from the VA within the past 3 years?
    Yes [attempt to recruit at 2-4 who answer yes]
    No 
2. Have you applied for disability compensation benefits from the VA within the past 3 years?
    Yes [attempt to recruit at 5-7 who answer yes]
    No 
3. Do you plan to file a pension or disability claim in the next 1 year?
   Yes [Maximum of 3 participants]
   No

All participants must answer Yes to at least one of the questions to qualify.

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
- Mix of education-level
- Mix of branch of service
- Mix of gender

## Timeline
We would like a kick-off meeting with Perigean. Possible times are:
- 5/22: 8am-11:30am PT or 3pm ET
- 5/23 8-9am PT, 9:30-10:30am PT, 11:30-12 PT1-3pm PT
