# Research Plan for 2024-02 Veteran Benefits Experience

## Background
The Benefits Portfolio crews work on Veteran-facing benefits products such as the 526-EZ for disability compensation claims, 0995 for decision reviews, and the 527-EZ for pension. Crews are currently looking forward and prioritizing new initiatives to support OCT and portfolio goals. This research is in support of that decision-making.

### OCTO Priorities 
This research supports OCTO's "Better Experiences" goal for 2024.

### Veteran Journey
Benefits portfolio products touch all aspects of the [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf). 

## Research Goals	
The portfolio will be using this research to
- Build on its' understanding of the overal benefits delivery experience
- Better understand what impacts Veteran trust, confidence, and satisfaction with the VA and VA benefits
- Rebuild its in-person research practice

### Outcome
The outcome of the research will help the portfolio build a strategy for meeting OCTO's goals of improving customer satisfaction by 5%, as well as help members of the portfolio who have less day-to-day involvement with research to be more grounded in Veteran experience. 

### Research questions
Research questions include:
- How do Veterans describe their benefits journey? Which aspects stand out as the biggest pain points or bright spots?
- How do Veteran's interactions with the VA, and VA tools like va.gov, engender or degrade their sense of trust in the VA?
- Do they have stories about building or eroding trust and confidence with other government agencies? Other service providers?
- [Conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/benefits-portfolio/Research/2024-02-San-Diego-Quarterly-ConversationGuide) 

### Hypothesis
This is open-ended research, so we are not testing any specific hypotheses. However, we expect to find that confidence and trust are built in part by the following:
- Being transparent
- Setting clear expectations and then meeting them
- Being timely
- At least appearing to be acting in support of Veterans, not appearing to be looking for ways to deny Veterans from their benefits.

## Methodology	
The team will be conducting short, in-person interviews in the San Diego regional office, in a single-room, round robin fashion. 
- Each session is 1 hour 15 mins (actual research time approximately 45 mins)
- 3 Veterans per session, 2 sessions
- Benefits portfolio participants will break into 3 teams (of 2, possibly 3 people) and will talk to each participant for 15 mins, with time for swapping teams and an overall introduction.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
We will recruit Veterans using Perigean's services.

### Recruitment criteria
- Recruit 8 Veterans for this study. 
- Seeking 3 participants and an alternate per session (2 sessions total). We will have a plan for if all 4 participants show.

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
- 50% of participants should be 44 or under.
- All participants should have applied for disability or pension benefits in the past 5 years. Ideally we would have an even mix of pension and disability.
- 50% of participants are POC/non-caucasian

The team is willing to be flexible on these criteria based on recruiting difficulty (in-person/time of day); please ask.

**Screener questions** 
1. Have you applied for pension benefits from the VA within the past 5 years?
    Yes [attempt to recruit at 2-4 who answer yes]
    No 
2. Have you applied for disability compensation benefits from the VA within the past 5 years?
    Yes [attempt to recruit at 4-6 who answer yes]
    No 

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
- Mix of education-level
- Mix of branch of service
- Mix of gender

## Timeline
We would like a kick-off meeting with Perigean.

### Prepare
* Date and time of pilot session: TBD;

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research: **February 14, 2024**


### Length of sessions
* Session length: 1 hour 15 mins, approximately 45 mins of interview time
* Buffer time between sessions: 30 minutes
