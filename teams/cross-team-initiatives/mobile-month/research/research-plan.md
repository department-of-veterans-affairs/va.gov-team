Research Plan for VSA Mobile Month, August 2020
===============================================

Goals
-----

*What product & team are you doing this research for?*

This research is for the mobile experience on VA.gov, across VSA teams.

*Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?*

As part of the mobile month initiative, we're interested in learning more about the Veteran experience visiting VA.gov on a mobile device. Our study will aim to validate whether perceived problems are in fact problems for Veterans, and get a better understanding of the UX of our mobile site.

*Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?*

We will be attempting to answer some (not all) of the below research questions, accounting for time:

* What usability issues does the design of the header and navigation present for Veterans?

*  What usability issues do Veterans encounter when checking on the status of a claim?

* What usability issues do Veterans encounter when looking for a VA location?

* What usability issues do Veterans encounter when using site search and looking for information on a content page?

* What usability issues do Veterans encounter when attempting to complete a multi-page form? 

* How much do Veterans struggle to find content in the right rail?
* Are there any gaps we need to fill in our mobile research guidelines?

*Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?*

Veterans will struggle with various things on mobile, including coginitive overload and "too much scrolling."

Method
------

*What method of research are you planning?*
