# Mobile Month August 2020 product outline

## Overview
Mobile Month will consist of a series of talks and collaborative working sessions that will aim to educate designers on the analytics, document user behavior on mobile devices on VA.gov, explore areas of improvement for the mobile UX, and create resources for designing for mobile.

## Problem Statement

About 40% of Veterans who visit VA.gov do so on a mobile device, and we expect that amount to increase over time. Also, designers at VA are encouraged to design mobile-first, but most of the design resources we have prioritize the desktop experience, which is responsive, but has largely neglected the mobile UX. 

How might we create mobile-specific resources for designers building on VA.gov so that they are empowered to create an excellent experience that meets the needs of Veterans using mobile devices?
 
## Desired User Outcomes

*Why would a user want to use this?*

Designers (and the teams they support) at VA will want to engage with Mobile Month so that they can become versed in analytics and make data-driven design decisions that specifically improve the mobile experience for Veterans.

*With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

After Mobile Month, designers at VA should be able to:
- Design flows using mobile-specific components and patterns in Sketch
- Confidently test their design work on mobile devices
- Articulate known user behavior on mobile
- Articulate the biggest pain points for the mobile experience

## Undesired User Outcomes
Designers feel more overwhelmed with meetings and resources, feeling like it’s “one more thing to do”



## Desired Business Outcomes

*Why would your business want this to exist?*
- So that the experience of VA.gov is Veteran-centered, and meets them where they are
- So that the mobile experience of VA.gov is consistent and excellent quality
- So that designers can create a consistent, excellent mobile experience of VA.gov more efficiently

- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

## Undesired Business Outcomes
The mobile experience of VA.gov becomes inconsistent, or deteriorates as mobile usage increases

## Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### KPIs
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*

- Increase in amount of mobile user research studies done with Veterans in Q3 & Q4
- All initiatives identified during Mobile Month are prioritized on Q3 (and Q4) roadmaps
- Mobile design templates exist in Sketch

* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

### OKRs
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

Increase in successful mobile form submissions [need to know baseline first]

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

Designers currently do not create mobile versions of their design work because they do not have mobile templates and components equivalent to the desktop versions.
Designers are currently unable to test their work on mobile because there is a lack of guidance
## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*
