This folder contains archived audit templates originally used by CAIA in 2023. If the ADE ever needs to share findings via GitHub / markdown, we can refer to these templates.

Refer to the [ADE Templates folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Sn5sGQ1zZ3nUQE1Ny4qnkIPPNOaf4omr) in our shared Google Drive for pilot, research, design review, and coded audit templates (permissions required).
