# Embedding

A key service offering from ADE is the ability for one or more accessibility specialists to embed on a delivery team. This document provides guidance for that process.

## Initiation

Once a delivery team indicates they would like an accessibility specialist to embed with them ADE accessibility lead and/or project manager schedule a kickoff call with the team. 

That team will designate a number of folks to attend, and ADE will bring one accessibility specialist (whoever will be serving as the team's primary point of contact) and potentially either a 2nd or the ADE project manager. 

### Goals for the kickoff meeting include

- Meet-and-greet, wherein the ADE accessibility specialist is introduced to the team members present
- Establish a basic meeting cadence for when the embedded ADE specialist will sync with the team
- Share expectations around ways of working, including the purview of the specialist's work, the channels where communication is to take place, etc.
- Share basic context around the team's goals, what they've accomplished so far, and where they need support from an accessibility specialist
- Set some high-level goals for deliverables that the ADE accessibility specialist is expected to produce, if any

### Immediately following the meeting

- ADE accessibility specialist serving as the primary point of contact will work with the ADE team lead and/or ADE project manager to identify a second
- Create a pinned thread within the `#accessibility-de-internal` channel on the DSVA Slack. This pinned thread will be where the supporting ADE accessibility specialists will provide updates to the wider ADE group, including ADE's VA POs
