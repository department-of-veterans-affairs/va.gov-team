# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **Cindy**. How are you doing today?

I have a colleague with us in this session who will be taking notes. 

*(if applicable)* [accessibility specialist] is also in this meeting to help with any technical issues that may arise with your use of assistive technology during this session. 

There are a few of my teammates who would like to observe this session as well. **Would it be OK with you if I invited them to join us?**
- *(If participant seems hesitant or unsure or uncomfortable)* Just so you know, my teammates will be muted and off camera and you won't have to interact with them. You also have the option to keep the session just the two of us plus the notetaker (and the technical support person).
- *(If yes, let them in--3-4 MAX. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")*

- *(OBSERVERS JOIN w/cameras ON )* We have a few people from the team listening in today: there's [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, etc. *(If I don't know the name of one of the observers, ask them to please turn on their camera and say their name aloud)*

Could the observers please turn their cameras off now to save bandwidth? 

Today we're going to talk about filling out VA forms online. I'm going to ask you a few questions, and then I'll have you do some specific tasks using a website that I will share with you.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This entire session may take 60 (or 90) minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We're testing a website to learn how we can make it easier to use. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** Whether or not you choose to participate will not affect your benefits with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Just let me know.

- Finally, I would like to record my screen and audio to confirm that I’ve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at the VA to show user feedback. If we do this, we don’t link anything you choose to share in the session to any information that identifies you, and we remove your face and name from any videos that we share.
**Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - *(If yes:)* Once I start recording, I am going to confirm once more that you are ok with me recording this session.

➡️ Select **Record**, then **Record to the cloud**.

*(If participant asks you to NOT record)* Are you comfortable if I save the transcript of the session? *(If not, take good notes!)*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: 
  - **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?** Yes / No
 
  - **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** Yes / No

In the bottom toolbar of the Zoom window, click the arrow next to **SHOW CAPTIONS** > **View Full Transcript** > Save (NEED TO DO THIS TO GET TRANSCRIPT)

*After checking that transcription is working, close the Transcript panel by clicking **Close Full Transcript** in the Show Captions menu.*

## Screen sharing instructions (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your computer, there's a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a button that says **Share** *(on phone, may need to scroll sideways or click **More...**)*
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)

- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the button that says **Share**. Then there will be options for what to share. Please choose **"Screen"** (phone) or your web browser.
- Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

- iPad: **Broadcast screen**
## Troubleshooting
- [Avoid **AI Companion**, which is a new option next to “Share” in the Zoom buttons]

- [If see **unpredictable jumping around** behavior and participant is using a browser other than Chrome, ask them to switch to Chrome (this helped with VoiceOver on an iPhone using Safari)]

- [If having **difficulty moving windows around** or opening the prototype, you could request control of the participant’s screen and mouse in Zoom: `<Name>’s screen tab > Request remote control`. Then you can move/resize browser (but not zoom windows/buttons) and type into browser bar. The participant may need to minimize the zoom video view, and drag the zoom buttons to the bottom of the screen so out of the way.]

# Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Let’s start with a few questions... 

1. I understand you are a Veteran. Is that right?

    - *(If **Dolphin** screen reader, won't be able to share screen on Zoom)*
    - *(if no AT)* Do you sometimes use assistive technology while using VA.gov or filling out a form online? 
      - If so, what do you use and when? 
        - Would you be willing to start using it now in this session? 
        - *(if not, run session w/o AT, or stop and ask Perigean for a replacement participant)*

1. How would you rate your level of experience with using a screen *(reader / magnifier)*--beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert?

1. How long have you been using a screen *(reader / magnifier)*?

1. Have you ever shared your screen in Zoom while using a screen *(reader / magnifier)*? *(Yes / No)*
    - If not, we can help you do that.

   - If so, can you tell me about your most recent experience? How did it go?


# User Tasks

## Task 0: Share screen

I would like you to share your screen with me so that I can see what you do during this session. Before we start, I want to make sure you know that screen share will show me your own screen, so if you'd like to close any apps or turn off notifications that you don't want me to see, you could do that now.
- *(refer to Screen sharing instructions above, if needed)*
- *STOP TECH TROUBLESHOOTING **< 15 min into session** if want a replacement participant from Perigean b/c not likely to be successful*

We can help guide you through this if you need help. Please say what you're doing out loud so that if there are any issues, we'll know what they are.
1. Make sure that the Zoom application has focus
1. Navigate to the screen share button
1. Check the "share sound" checkbox (so we can hear their screen reader speaking)--may have to tab a LOT to get to this in the right pane
1. Activate the screen share

**(If we can't hear the screen reader)** Since I can't hear your screen reader and don't want to interrupt it, after I ask you to do something, I'll try to not say anything until you say that you're done or need help, OK?

**(If video window is covering up phone screen)** It looks like my zoom video is covering up a lot of your screen. Could you please swipe it off? (Screen reader: swipe right until the video window has focus, and then double tap when you hear "Stash preview".)

## Task 00: Open prototype
Now I'd like you to open a website that I'm going to share with you. 

I will *[email/text/dictate/put into the Zoom chat]* the URL: **https://bit.ly/4lXVLTV** -- after 4 is the lower case letter "L"
- *(If asked, reassure that this is a legitimate link to what I want you to test)*
- *(Might need to hold tablet horizontally so easier to read)*
- Alex’s backup codespace: https://bit.ly/3Z3Xc9j

Did you get the link? 

- *If “unsupported browser” error, ask to try a different browser or device, or share my screen (works for anyone) and mouse control (doesn't work w/iPhones)*
- *If prototype doesn't open, copy the URL and open in a new incognito window (Chrome), private window (Firefox, Safari) or InPrivate (Edge)*

Please click the (green) "Continue" button.

**You'll be interacting with a demo prototype today.** Since it's a demo, note that none of your actions will affect your own VA information or benefits.


## Task 1: Form intro page
[start on unauthenticated form intro page]

I'd like you to take a look at this page, and then use it to get your military records.

Please **talk aloud** about what you're thinking BEFORE clicking on anything. And please share any **thoughts, reactions, or questions** you have about the current web page.

[Sign in to start your request > Start your request; *must use enter, not space*]

[When they get to the form:] Please stop here so I can give you the next instruction.

### Watch for:
- [Notice "You can save this request" light blue alert? Y / N]

**(If can’t see zoomed screen)** Is your screen zoomed in? If so, I can’t see that. Could you please tell me how far across the page you can see? And how far down from the top of the page?

## Task 2: Fill out form [never reload the page]
Please fill out this form to request your own military records, but I want you to use fake details so you don't share your personal information with me. 

[If p is quiet] Please talk aloud about any thoughts, reactions, or questions you have.

### Watch for:
- [Notice "We'll save your application on every change"? Y / N]
- [Anything re the progress bar? Steps vs. screens?]
- [Anything re error messages? If so:
  - Do they know what the error means?
  - Do they know how to resolve the error?
  - How do they want to find out about errors?] 
- [Any issues w/field validation on VA file number?]

[Note: If click on anything that goes outside the codespace (e.g., VA logo), you'll see spinning and get stuck. To fix, go back in your browser.]

## Task 3: (After enter SSN, before Continue) Short break in filling out form
Pretend that your doorbell just rang, and you want to jump up to answer it. What will you do with the form that you're in the middle of filling out?

- [leave open in browser / close browser / Finish later button / __________________]

### Watch for:
- [Anything re saving info entered]
- [Anything re the "Finish later" button]
  - [Noticed "Your records request has been saved"? Y / N]



## Task 4: Resume filling out form
OK, now let's say that you're back from answering the door. Please resume filling out the form that you were working on. 

- [Record how resume: open browser tab / "Continue your request" button on form intro page / Link on My VA]

- [If needed, tell what to click to go to **Unauth (Lemon) / Auth (Apple) / My VA (Mango)**]

- [Can also get to My VA from header link and from Chris dropdown menu]

[If p is quiet] Please talk aloud about any thoughts, reactions, or questions you have.

### Watch for:
- [Anything re saving info entered]
- [See if go back to previous page to remember what they were doing]
- [Anything re the progress bar? Steps vs. screens?]
- [Anything re error messages? If so:
  - Do they know what the error means?
  - Do they know how to resolve the error?
  - How do they want to find out about errors?] 




## Task 5: (After specify records, after Continue) Long break in filling out form
Say that you're really hungry and need to take a longer break to make a snack/lunch/dinner. What will you do with the form that you're filling out?

- [leave open in browser / close browser / Finish later button / __________________]

- *[If "leave open in browser"*, ASK:]
     - What if you were filling out this form in a public place, such as a library?
     - If you leave the browser open and go away, you'll be signed out after 30 minutes. What do you think will happen to the information you entered? 

### Watch for:
- [Anything re saving info entered]
- [Anything re the "Finish later" button]
  - [Noticed "Your records request has been saved"? Y / N]

*[If see “Uncaught runtime errors”, close with “X” (label “dismiss”) in top right corner, Leave site if prompted. Check my browser window to see if codespace shut down. If so, restart it.
Then have them click on the Apple button to resume/start over.]*

## Task 6: Resume filling out form (again)
OK, pretend that you just finished your snack/lunch/dinner. Now you want to get back to the form you were filling out. How would you do that?

[Record how resume: open browser tab / "Continue your request" button on form intro page / Link on My VA]

- [If needed, tell what to click to go to Unauth (Lemon) / Auth (Apple) / My VA (Mango)]

[If p is quiet] Please talk aloud about any thoughts, reactions, or questions you have.

### Watch for:
- [Anything re saving info entered]
- [See if go back to previous page to remember what they were doing]
- [Anything re the progress bar? Steps vs. screens?]
- [Anything re error messages? If so:
  - Do they know what the error means?
  - Do they know how to resolve the error?
  - How do they want to find out about errors?] 

[If see "can't submit your request" alert, say:] Don't worry! It's not working because this is a prototype, not a real form.

## Thank You and Closing - 3 minutes

**Are you still okay if we use any video or audio clips from this session?** 
- *(yes / no)*
- *(If participant says yes)* Is there any part of our discussion that you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

**We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today**. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to learn about Veterans so we can improve the online tools that we provide.

If you know any other Veterans or family members who might be willing to participate in a future research session like this one, you can pass along the web link that you'll receive in your email from our team. 

Thank you so much again, and I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day!
