# Research Plan for 2025-04 SiP research study 

## Background üèóÔ∏è
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>
	
When VA.gov users are logged in (authenticated) and filling out a form, the "save in progress" alert flashes on and off with every field entered. Because the alert displays below the Back and Continue buttons, screen readers never announce it, which is an accessibility issue.

We are testing a modification of the VA Design System [Header - Minimal component](https://design.va.gov/components/header/header-minimal) for the design of new web forms. We have removed the "save in progress" alert, and redesigned the existing "Finish this request later" link that functions like a button. The currently existing text about saving will remain on the authenticated version of the form intro page and the first page of the form.

### [OCTO-DE Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md) 

This research supports the following OCTO priorities:

Objective 1:  VA‚Äôs digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.
- Key Result 1: Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.

### [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

Veterans and others (caregivers, family members, survivors, and service members) may use web forms on VA.gov throughout ALL stages of the Veteran Journey--Serving and separation, Living civilian life, and Retiring and aging.

## Research Goals ü•Ö	

### Goals

1. (primary) Learn about Veterans' expectations for saving information while filling out an online form before the form is submitted.
1. (primary) Get user feedback on design revisions for "save in progress" and "finish this request later" that reduce the redundant messaging around saving.
1. (secondary) Get user feedback on error messages and the progress bar while filling out online forms.
  
### Outcome

Findings and recommendations from this research will **inform guidance and documentation for the "save in progress" feature** that is present for authenticated users filling out forms on VA.gov. Matt Dingee asked ADE to help with this because some VFS teams are innovating new designs, whereas "save in progress" should be a standard pattern used by all teams.

In addition, user feedback collected on "finish this request later", error messages, and the progress bar will be helpful for accessibility specialists advising VFS teams.


### Research questions

**Research goal: Learn about Veterans' expectations for saving information while filling out an online form before the form is submitted.**
1. What experiences have Veterans had around saving while filling out VA forms?
1. What expectations do Veterans have about whether information will be saved while filling out an online form?
     1. What do Veterans expect to happen to their form data if they stop in the middle of filling out a form?
     1. What do Veterans expect to happen to their form data if they close the form page?
     1. How do Veterans expect to resume working on a form that they previously started filling out?

Research goal: Get user feedback on a proposed design revision for "save in progress" and "finish this request later".

1. Do Veterans think that their form data is being saved? If so, how do they know?
1. Are Veterans able to stop working on a form and go back to it later? If so, how do they do it?
1. Do Veterans notice the alert about saving on the form intro page?
1. Do Veterans notice the text about saving on the first page only of the form below the progress stepper>?

Research goal: Get user feedback on error messages and the progress bar while filling out online forms.

5. What reactions do Veterans have to error messages? 
     1. Do they know what the error messages mean, and how to resolve them?
     1. How do they want to find out about errors?
1. What reactions do Veterans have to the progress bar? Do they notice it?

### Hypothesis

1. While filling out online forms, Veterans expect that their form data will be saved.

1. With the new design, Veterans are confident that their form data will be saved.

1. With the new design, Veterans will know how to resume filling out a form that they previously started filling out.

1. When Veterans encounter error messages while filling out online forms, they are able to resolve the errors.

1. While filling out an online form, Veterans will notice the progress bar and find it useful.

## Methodology  üõ†Ô∏è
We will conduct **remote moderated usability testing** to observe research participants filling out an online form while authenticated so that the information entered will be automatically saved before the form is submitted.   

Sessions will be conducted over Zoom with transcripts. 

### Location
This is remote research over Zoom. 
- [X] **Remote**
- [ ] **In-person**
      
## Research materials üìî

> [!NOTE]
> **Your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials ‚Äì including this plan ‚Äì  prior to submitting a recruitment request.**

We would like Perigean to recruit both AT users and non-AT users who are Veterans, caregivers, and family members.

### Recruitment criteria

> [!NOTE]

## Timeline üóìÔ∏è
> [!NOTE]
> **Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.** 

### Prepare
*When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).*

**A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.** 
> [!NOTE]
> **Send pilot participant email in study Slack channel**

- `Pilot participant name:` **TBD**
- `Date and time of pilot session:` **TBD** 

### Research sessions
- `Planned dates of research:` **May 1 - May 9**

### Length of sessions
- `Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)` **90 min for AT users, 60 min for non-AT users**
  
- `Buffer time between sessions:` **30 min**
  
- `Maximum Sessions per day:` **3**

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. 

> [!TIP]
> Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. **(e.g. 3/17, Monday 9:00AM-1:00PM, 3:00PM-6:00PM EST; 3/18, Tuesday 9:00AM-6:00PM EST, etc.;** ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
>
> **Place time slots between `hash marks` when in edit mode.**

- `[May 1, Thu, 9 AM/PM-TT:TT AM/PM] EST`
- `[MM/DD, Day, TT:TT AM/PM-TT:TT AM/PM] EST`
- `[MM/DD, Day, TT:TT AM/PM-TT:TT AM/PM] EST`
- `[MM/DD, Day, TT:TT AM/PM-TT:TT AM/PM] EST`
- `[MM/DD, Day, TT:TT AM/PM-TT:TT AM/PM] EST`
- `Add more slots as needed`
