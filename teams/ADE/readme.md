# Accessibility Digital Experience (ADE) Team (pronounced /ād/)

_Accessibility Digital Experience aka Accessibility DE or for short, ADE (pronounced "aide"), is OCTO's new accessibility team under SPRUCE._
## Our goal
Our goal is to empower teams to deliver the most accessible products possible for Veterans. We do this by providing teams with insights, training, and support as accessibility subject matter experts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **We are here to partner with you and provide guidance on how to achieve accessible outcomes**.

## How ADE can help your team with accessibility
The Accessibility Digital Experience team is a team of familiar faces, and some new, who are here to help your team deliver the highest, quality accessible product possible to our Veterans. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This document explains some of the ways that ADE can help aide your team with accessibility.**

### How we relate to the Collaboration Cycle
We've grouped our offerings by how they relate to the [touch point meetings in the Collaboration Cycle](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/). We've done this because the Collaboration Cycle is a well-known process for our community, and maps well to how we do work. 

> [!NOTE]
> Note that ADE can assist teams going through the Collaboration Cycle, but **ADE is not involved in the Collaboration Cycle directly**. We are here to help you launch the best products possible, we're not gatekeepers. If we find and flag an issue we can't and won't block you from launching. Teams going through the Collaboration Cycle can work with us, as can teams working outside of it.

## Services we offer
What follows is a menu of the services we offer. 
> [!TIP]
> No worries if you don't know what exactly you need, though, feel free to contact us on the DSVA Slack using our `@accessibility-de` handle on the `#accessibility-help` channel. [View additional ways to reach out for support.](#how-to-contact-us)

### Research support
> [!TIP]
> Good news! We not only have a new name, but we also have new services to offer your team! Be sure to review our recently expanded assistive technology research service offerings in this section of our service menu! 

We can now aid your research work and help you both plan and conduct UX research with users of assistive technology (AT). More specifically, we can provide guidance with
- Writing research plans 
- Defining recruitment criteria
- Crafting screening questions for inclusive recruiting
- Writing conversation guides
- Building accessible prototypes
- Moderating research sessions

When you’re ready to conduct user research, our ADE accessibility specialists can aid your team by
- Simulating a participant using AT during a [pilot session](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/ADE/assistive-tech-pilot-guide.md)
- Providing live technical support during AT research sessions
- Observing research sessions with users of AT
- Documenting accessibility-related issues encountered
- Moderating research sessions

There may also be opportunities to collaborate with an accessibility researcher to conduct research. If you’re interested, let us know!

> [!CAUTION]
> Note that we cannot provide extensive on call technical support during research sessions. If you are worried about technical issues, we recommend running a pilot session or two with ADE specialists so that we can discuss ways to best support your needs.

### VA 508 office audit review
> [!TIP]
> This is a new service offered by the ADE team.

We will review the results of your VA 508 office audit and:
- Determine what team owns each issue
- Write up instructions for how to correct each issue
- Provide those instructions to relevant teams
- Update the VA 508 office when issues are corrected

### Accessibility test planning
We can work with a team to develop an accessibility-focused testing plan so that during design and development you are able to continually ensure that your product is accessible. We can help develop the plan, and walk you through how to run the tests. We have experience creating plans for both automated and manual testing.

### Support design discovery
We can work with you and your team during design discovery to ensure that accessibility considerations are being taken into account, and help to flag when something may be veering away from the accessible happy path.

### Review wireframes and Figma prototypes
We can review your static wireframes or interactive prototypes looking for potential accessibility issues. **We can also work with you and advise on how to annotate designs to ensure that they are easy to implement in an accessible way.**

### PDF audit
We can review PDF documents for accessibility, and help advise on how to remediate any issues found.

### Staging / CodePen / Codespace / Production audit
We can review coded products, whether they're on staging, CodePen, Codespace, or are already in production. We test with assistive technology, review for accessibility best practices, and ensure that the product meets OCTO-DE accessibility experience standards. 

**We can also help you prepare the [required accessibility testing artifact](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/prepare-for-an-accessibility-staging-review#artifact) for the Collaboration Cycle.**

We can audit products for accessibility issues on desktop and mobile devices (subject to device availability among ADE specialists).

### Health check audit
This is very much like a staging review but done in production! This is useful for older products that were implemented and released before certain standards were put into place.

### Training and education
We can provide training and resources for you and your team on accessibility best practices and methodologies above and beyond what Governance offers at onboarding. Also, don't miss the [accessibility champs program](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/a11y-champs)!
