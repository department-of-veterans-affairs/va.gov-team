# Team README Instructions

## ⚠️ Team Documentation Has Moved

**Team README creation and management has been migrated to our private repository to protect team member privacy while keeping product documentation public.**

### For VA Team Members

- **Create team READMEs:** Access our private repository where team documentation templates and instructions are now maintained
- **Update existing teams:** Follow the same process using updated templates in the private repository
- **Get support:** Reach out in [#vfs-all-teams](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/vfs-all-teams) for guidance on the migration

### For External Contributors

This public repository maintains:
- **Product documentation:** All user-facing product information in [/products](../products/README.md)
- **Platform documentation:** Developer resources at [VA Platform documentation](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/)
- **General contact information:** Available through product documentation and platform support channels

### About This Change

We've implemented a dual-repository approach to balance transparency with privacy protection:

- **Private repository:** Contains team rosters, organizational details, and sensitive team information
- **Public repository:** Maintains all product documentation, technical resources, and public-facing information

This ensures that:
- Veterans and the public can access all product and service information
- External contributors can find the technical resources they need  
- Team member personal information remains protected
- Our commitment to open source and transparency is maintained for all non-sensitive content
