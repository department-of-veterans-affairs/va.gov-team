# Team README Instructions

## ⚠️ Team Documentation Has Moved

Team README creation and management has been migrated to our private repository to protect team member privacy while keeping product documentation public.

**New Location:** [va.gov-team-sensitive/teams/team-readme-instructions.md](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/teams/team-readme-instructions.md)

### For VA Team Members

Access the complete team README instructions and templates in the private repository, which includes:
- Team README template and creation instructions
- Validation requirements and formatting guidelines  
- Product integration guidance
- Organizational structure requirements

### For External Contributors

This public repository maintains:
- **Product documentation:** All user-facing product information in [/products](../products/README.md)
- **Platform documentation:** Developer resources at [VA Platform documentation](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/)
- **General contact information:** Available through product documentation and platform support channels
