# Embedding

A key service offering from CAIA is the ability for one or more accessibility specialists to embed on a delivery team. This document provides guidance for that process.

## Initiation

Once a delivery team indicates they would like an accessibility specialist to embed with them CAIA accessibility lead and/or project manager schedule a kickoff call with the team. 

That team will designate a number of folks to attend, and CAIA will bring one accessibility specialist (whoever will be serving as the team's primary point of contact) and potentially either a 2nd or the CAIA project manager. 

### Goals for the kickoff meeting include

- Meet-and-greet, wherein the CAIA accessibility specialist is introduced to the team members present
- Establish a basic meeting cadence for when the embedded CAIA specialist will sync with the team
- Share expectations around ways of working, including the purview of the specialist's work, the channels where communication is to take place, etc.
- Share basic context around the team's goals, what they've accomplished so far, and where they need support from an accessibility specialist
- Set some high-level goals for deliverables that the CAIA accessibility specialist is expected to produce, if any

### Immediately following the meeting

- CAIA accessibility specialist serving as the primary point of contact will work with the CAIA team lead and/or CAIA project manager to identify a second
- Create a pinned thread within the `#caia-team-internal` channel on the DSVA Slack. This pinned thread will be where the supporting CAIA accessibility specialists will provide updates to the wider CAIA group, including CAIA's VA POs
