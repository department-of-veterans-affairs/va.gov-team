### Finding Types

`CHATBOT VERSION`

Since the chatbot is a different flow than webpages or a form, we tested by using WCAG and W3Câ€™s Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force (COGA TF) to fill in the gaps directed at cognitive disabilities. 

The items that failed were equally in relation to WCAG and COGA: 

`NON-CHATBOT VERSION`

We completed testing based on the WCAG, W3C's, Experience Standards and Severity Rubric from the VA, to go beyond compliance.  

`REMOVE TYPES THAT DO NOT APPLY`
