# Accessibility cookbook

## What is this

This document serves as a place to record **solutions** for all sorts of accessibility issues we run into in our day-to-day work. 

While folks working in [content](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/CAIA/content) are able to lean on the [content style guide](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/), there isn't such a singular source of truth for accessibility; we look to WCAG, the [VA Design System](https://design.va.gov/), and our own best judgement, but sometimes we need something more.

## Who is this for

This cookbook aims to fill that gap, for the time being. While primarily intended for use by CAIA accessibility specialists, we invite the entire community of practice within OCTO to contribute recipes. Our hope is that this collection of recipes can help us create greater alignment between all accessibility specialists as we provide support and guidance to folks implementing and updating Veteran-facing products.

## Suggested format

While there isn't a strict template to follow when adding a recipe to the cookbook we suggest that it include a few key pieces of information as makes sense: 

- Description of the accessibility problem being solved
- Description of the ideal end-state
- Implementation/remediation details, if possible, including code samples and/or annotated screenshots
- Date recipe was added/last updated
