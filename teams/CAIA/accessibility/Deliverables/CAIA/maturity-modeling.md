`[WIP]`

[Per a request from Martha Wilkes request to produce a maturity model to gauge teams' accessibility practices](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/56240).

This work aims to produce a tool that helps to prioritize which teams need support at what point in the design and development lifecycle (this could be within, or external from the Collab cycle), and provide teams with a roadmap on how to "level-up" their internal accessibility practice. 

A few key considerations: 

- tool should prioritize helping teams over rating products
- tool isn't meant to be punitive, but to provide a useful way for teams to identify their processes, and as a way for support groups like CAIA to quickly understand a team's approach to accessibility

Facets to consider, as brainstormed by the wider community of practice for accessibility: 

- does the team have an embedded accessibility specialist
- has anyone on the team completed the champs program
- does the team regularly produce testing plans that include accessibility
- does the team have metrics that account for accessibility
- is there collaboration between designers, engineers, and accessibility specialists
- are experimental patterns reviewed by accessibility specialists before they are used
- does the team regularly conduct inclusive research sessions
- has the team successfully completed (some number of) staging reviews with no major accessibility findings
- does the team annotate its prototypes with useful accessibility information
- how many current, open accessibility issues does the team have
- does the team have unit tests in place that include accessibility
