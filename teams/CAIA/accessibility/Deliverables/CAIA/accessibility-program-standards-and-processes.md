# Important Standards and Processes of an Accessibility Program
This document outlines standards and processes for a mature accessibility program.

## Standards
These are defined as the level at which we aim to accomplish something.

### Accessibility Defect Rubric
**What is it?** Defines guidance for how accessibility defects should be prioritized.

**Why is it useful?** Allows product owners and teams to prioritize an accessibility backlog.

**VA status:** Implemented.

### Program Metrics
**What is it?** Defines what internal metrics make up how an accessibility program is succeeding or failing.

**Why is it useful?** Allows the practice of accessibility to chart progress forward or backward. Plus, it adds a mechanism to guide decision making. Otherwise, it will feel like fighting fires, instead of building the fire suppression system.

**VA status:** Implemented; Needs revision.

### Accessibility Role Definitions
**What is it?** Defines the skills needed for different types of accessibility roles within the organization.

**Why is it useful?** Can anchor how the organization needs to hire accessibility professionals ahead of time instead of at the last minute when a hire is needed.

**VA status:** Not implemented; [In progress](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/CAIA/accessibility/Deliverables/CAIA/accessibility-specialist-capabilities.md).

### Accessibility Role Org Chart
**What is it?** Defines how accessibility personnel are deployed throughout the organization and who's responsible for the accessibility of various products.

**Why is it useful?** It can show you where you might be needing accessibility skills or help.

**VA status:** Not implemented.

### What Makes an Accessible Product
**What is it?** Defines the standard for an accessible product for the organization. This is likely to map to existing standards like WCAG 2.2, but an organization can always go above and beyond existing standards.

**Why is it useful?** Can help the organization know when and when not to launch a product.

**VA status:** Not implemented.

### Accessibility Tooling
**What is it?** Defines the standard set of software and tooling used to audit for accessibility. Can also include automated accessibility tooling.

**Why is it useful?** Sets a baseline for the tooling used, which is helpful in budgeting or defining testing standards.

**VA status:** In progress (Not officially standardized â€” both CAIA and governance have in-house standards that inform each other).

### Required Accessibility Training
**What is it?** Defines the type and duration of training that staff of different roles need to complete to have a baseline understanding of accessibility and their responsibilities.

**Why is it useful?** Sets a baseline for what people in the organization should learn about accessibility.

**VA status:** In progress (Platform/Governance has standard accessibility onboarding).

## Processes
These are defined as how we aim to accomplish something.

### Escalation Pathway
**What is it?** Defines when a product should be stopped from going into production because of an accessibility defect, and who makes that call.

**Why is it useful?** Provides a clear line of who's in charge of making difficult decisions when it comes to accessibility.

**VA status:** Not implemented.

### How Products are Audited
**What is it?** Defines the process for how products get audited.

**Why is it useful?** Provides consistency for multiple accessibility specialists conducting audits.

**VA status:** In progress (There's a well-documented staging review process, but that's just for Governance, and doesn't cover other teams/areas, like CAIA and the 508 Office).

### How Accessibility Defects are Tracked
**What is it?** Defines how to write a standard accessibility defect ticket.

**Why is it useful?** Provides consistency for tickets so teams can parse them easier no matter who creates the ticket.

**VA status:** Implemented (usually team by team).

### How Accessibility Defects are Resolved
**What is it?** Defines how a standard accessibility defect should be resolved, and the involvement of accessibility specialists.

**Why is it useful?** Since accessibility defects can often have legal implications, it's important to have a consistent process for when and how they're addressed.

**VA status:** Implemented (mostly through Governance/Collaboration Cycle).

### Accessibility Research Tips
**What is it?** Defines some best practices for conducting research sessions with people with disabilities.

**Why is it useful?** Helps researchers understand how to bring people with disabilities into their processes.

**VA status:** Implemented (on Platform website); Needs revision.

### Training & Documentation Plan
**What is it?** This is different from the "Required Accessibility Training." Defines how training and documentation gets maintained and updated.

**Why is it useful?** Without knowing who's responsible for these items, they tend to get left alone and lose usefulness.

**VA status:** Not implemented (Partially implemented through Champions program).

### Accessibility Governance
**What is it?** Defines how products get to production and accessibility gets checked along the way.

**Why is it useful?** Without some level of governance, launching inaccessible products will be easy to do, and the amount of accessibility defects will never fall.

**VA status:** In progress (Some governance exists, thanks to the Platform team, but it also needs to be documented and supported by an escalation pathway).
