# Audit Findings: Chatbot MHV Prescriptions Skill 

**ACCESS TICKET** [#67376](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/67376)

**External consideration:** We realize that some of the issues identified with the chatbot may be specific to Microsoft, beyond the scope and ability of the VA to remediate, and that tickets may need to be drawn up with Microsoft. This audit was completed to bring attention to all issues, regardless of owner, for a comprehensive accessibility review of the chatbot for the end user. 

Should you have any questions regarding this deliverable, please let us know. The CAIA A11ys are happy to help!

## Audit Snapshot

### Audited Items

The **CAIA Accessibility Team** successfully audited 65.45% of auditable items on the CAIA a11y Chatbot Audit Spreadsheet using the Dev environment provided for the Chatbot MHV Prescriptions Skill Feature.

Based on the date of staging (10/12/2023) and the findings found thus far, we are going to pause our audit and share these findings with the Governance Team and the Project Team. 

**Audit Status** | **Audit Items (Count)** | **Percent of Total (%)**
-- | -- | --
Failed | 9 | 16.36% 
Further investigation needed | 5 | 9.09%

Addressed in another recommendation | 3 | 5.45%
Remaining items be audited | 19 | 34.55%
**Total** | **55** | **100.00%**

### Finding Types
Since the chatbot is a different flow than webpages or a form, we are testing by using WCAG and W3Câ€™s Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force (COGA TF) to fill in the gaps directed at cognitive disabilities. 

The items that failed were equally in relation to WCAG and COGA: 

**Type** | **Count of Audited Items**
-- | -- 
COGA Only | 3
Not WCAG or COGA | 2
WCAG and COGA | 1
WCAG only | 3
**Total Findings Failing** | 9

### Impact of Impact Areas


**Impact Areas** | **Impact of Appearance (Count)** | **Percent of Impact Areas (%)**

Visual | 8 | 27.59%
Auditory | 2 | 6.90%
Speech | 2 | 6.90%
Physical | 3 | 10.34%
**Total** | **29** | **100.00%**
