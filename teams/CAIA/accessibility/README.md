# CAIA: Accessibility
[Access an A11Y](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/edit/master/teams/CAIA/accessibility/README.md#how-to-contact-us)

## Our goal
Our goal is to empower teams to deliver the most accessible products possible for Veterans. We do this by providing teams with insights, training, and support as accessibility subject matter experts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **We are here to partner with you and provide guidance on how to achieve accessible outcomes**.

## How CAIA can help your team with accessibility
The Content, Accessibility, and Information Architecture team, or CAIA, is a cross-functional team of folks here to help your team deliver the highest quality product possible to Veterans. 

This document explains some of the ways that CAIA can help your team with accessibility.

### How we relate to the Collaboration Cycle
We've grouped our offerings by how they relate to the [touch point meetings in the Collaboration Cycle](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/). We've done this because the Collaboration Cycle is a well-known process for our community, and maps well to how we do work. 

> [!NOTE]
> Note that CAIA can assist teams going through the Collaboration Cycle, but **CAIA is not involved in the Collaboration Cycle directly**. We are here to help you launch the best products possible, we're not gatekeepers. If we find and flag an issue we can't and won't block you from launching. Teams going through the Collaboration Cycle can work with us, as can teams working outside of it.

## Services we offer
What follows is a menu of the services we offer. 
> [!TIP]
> No worries if you don't know what exactly you need, though, feel free to contact us on the DSVA Slack using the `#accessibility-help` or the `#sitewide-content-accessibility-ia` channels.

### Research support
[CAIA accessibility specialists can help with your user research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=coforma-terry&labels=508%2FAccessibility%2C+sitewide+CAIA%2C+sitewide+accessibility%2C+CAIA-a11y-research&projects=&template=caia-a11y-research.yaml&title=%5BCAIA+A11y+Research%5D%3A+Team+name%2C+product+name). We can assist as you plan your research sessions, ensuring that they are equitable and account for important accessibility factors. [We recommend a pilot session with a CAIA accessibility specialist](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/CAIA/accessibility/assistive-tech-pilot-guide.md) before running your research sessions, to mitigate any potential accessibility-related issues. When it comes time to run research sessions, we can also provide limited technical support for research participants who use screen readers. We can also observe your assistive technology sessions through an accessibility-focused lens, documenting accessibility-related issues the user encounters. 
> [!CAUTION]
> Note that we cannot provide extensive, on call, technical support during research sessions - if you are worried about technical issues, we recommend running a pilot session or two with CAIA specialists so that we can discuss ways to best support your needs.

### Accessibility test planning
We can work with a team to develop an accessibility-focused testing plan so that during design and development you are able to continually ensure that your product is accessible. We can help develop the plan, and walk you through how to run the tests. We have experience creating plans for both automated and manual testing.

### Support design discovery
We can work with you and your team during design discovery to ensure that accessibility considerations are being taken into account, and help to flag when something may be veering away from the accessible happy path.

### Review wireframes and Figma prototypes
We can review your static wireframes or interactive prototypes looking for potential accessibility issues. **We can also work with you and advise on how to annotate designs to ensure that they are easy to implement in an accessible way.**

### PDF audit
We can review PDF documents for accessibility, and help advise on how to remediate any issues found.

### Staging / CodePen / Production audit
We can review coded products, either on staging or CodePen. We test with assistive technology, review for accessibility best practices, and ensure that the product meets OCTO-DE accessibility experience standards. 

**We can also help you prepare the [required accessibility testing artifact](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/prepare-for-an-accessibility-staging-review#artifact) for the Collaboration Cycle.**

We can audit products for accessibility issues on desktop and mobile devices (subject to device availability among CAIA specialists).

### Health check audit
This is very much like a staging review but done in production! This is useful for older products that were implemented and released before certain standards were put into place.

### Training and education
We can provide training and resources for you and your team on accessibility best practices and methodologies above and beyond what Governance offers at onboarding. Also, don't miss the [accessibility champs program](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/a11y-champs)!

### Spot checks, general guidance
We are always here for more general, off-the-cuff questions! Never hesitate to reach out to us on the DSVA Slack in either the `#accessibility-help` or the `#sitewide-content-accessibility-ia` channels.
