# Assistive Technology Pilot Guide

VA’s goal is for our products to be accessible to all who use them, including those with disabilities. Testing products with users of assistive technology (AT) helps us achieve this goal. But many VFS teams haven’t used AT themselves, or haven’t done research with AT users before. 

The CAIA Accessibility team can help by running a pilot session with you before your study. The goal of a pilot is to evaluate your product, point out issues, and give you a taste of what a session with AT users may be like. We’ll let you know what to look out for, and what to avoid.

## Benefits to running a pilot
- Ensure that your product is usable by the very participants you want to test with - those using assistive technology
- Get recommendations on how to address issues like sharing prototype links and managing Zoom
- Observe assistive technology in use before interacting with actual participants
- Get valuable feedback about your prototype and conversation guide, which you can then adjust before your study begins 

## First steps
- Review this guide, as part of your [Assistive Technology Research Request](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=coforma-terry&labels=508%2FAccessibility%2C+sitewide+CAIA%2C+sitewide+accessibility%2C+CAIA-a11y-research&projects=&template=caia-a11y-research.yaml&title=%5BCAIA+A11y+Research%5D%3A+Team+name%2C+product+name) ticket
- After beginning to collaborate with CAIA, let us know that you want to do a pilot
  - If you do, we'll create a child ticket to keep track of that work and provide feedback

## Before the pilot
Your team will:
- Let CAIA know what kind of AT use you hope to test with during your study
- Provide CAIA with your conversation guide, research plan, and the prototype(s) you intend to use during the study
- Implement CAIA’s recommendations, as time allows

CAIA will:
- Determine who will run the pilot(s) based on your needs and our AT availability (some of us don’t have access to mobile devices for testing, for example)
- Review your conversation guide, research plan, and prototype, and give recommendations for improvements
- Open an internal ticket, to track our work

Together, we will:
- Determine how many pilots you need (a pilot each for mobile and desktop, for example)
- Schedule your pilot(s)
	- We recommend that a notetaker comes to each pilot; as the “test subject,” the CAIA specialist won’t be able to take many notes

## During the pilot
Your team will:
- Run through as much of the conversation guide as will be helpful to you
- Take notes
- Be open

CAIA will:
- Let you know if the specialist is a Veteran or not, which may impact which questions you ask during the pilot
- Answer your questions as they come up
- Stay in ‘character’ most of the time…
- But break ‘character’ to point out technical issues or make observations

## After the pilot
Your team will:
- Share findings with the rest of the team
- Reach out with any additional questions
- Coordinate with CAIA to get assistance during AT user research sessions with actual participants, if desired

CAIA will:
- Write a summary of findings / observations as a comment on the pilot ticket
- Tag your team via the ticket and in Slack
- Join you for a debrief, if your team requests it
- Help you however possible moving forward
