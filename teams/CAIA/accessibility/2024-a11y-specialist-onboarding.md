## Get on board!
Whether you're VA staff or a contractor, getting access to the VA systems and tools you need can take time. 
- As a **contractor**, you'll be in touch with a contracting officer (or "COR"), who'll help you get the process started.
- You'll need to create a GitHub account using your work email address too.

**This section includes information about:**
- Platform Orientation Ticket
- Timeframe for onboarding and access
- Technology utilization

<details><summary>Toggle to reveal important onboarding information :accessibility:</summary>
  
### Platform Orientation Ticket
Eventually, you'll be assigned to a `New VFS Team Member Template ticket` in GitHub (see a [ticket example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/74103)). This ticket will take you through all the steps you need to onboard!

**At ths end of this process, you'll have:**
- A VA.gov email address
- A way to connect to VA's VPN
- Access to the VA GitHub organization
- Access to the Office of CTO @ VA Slack workspace (also known as DSVA, or "Digital Services at VA")
- Access to practice-specific tools that you may need to do your job

### Timeframe
This is going to take time. It can take a month, or even longer, to get fully onboarded. Your COR and product lead team will do everything they can to make the process go as smoothly and quickly as possible.

### Technology
Some accessibility specialists use government-furnished equipment, or "GFE", to access VA systems or use Windows-only applications like JAWS. If you need GFE, talk to your product owner. It may already be included in your company's contract. And many VA contractors use their company computers for all, or the vast majority, of their work. 

Be sure to [opt out of VA.gov analytics](https://www.va.gov/analytics-opt-out.html) on your work computer.

## VA.gov's approach to accessibility
VA's [accessibility vision statement](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/modernized-va-gov-accessibility-strategy#ModernizedVA.govAccessibilityStrategy-Vision) is clear:
> "That every disabled Veteran and caregiver has guaranteed access to equitable, easy to use, self-service tools without needing to request accommodations."

To do this, VA aims to account for accessibility concerns at all stages of the development lifecycle - "accessibility beyond compliance." 

We do research with people with disabilities, annotate our designs, use and develop a robust design system, perform end-to-end testing, and provide means of accessiblility support for product teams. And we follow a set of robust [experience standards](https://design.va.gov/about/experience-standards/) that we apply to all products before launch.

By doing this, we hope to create products that do more than conform to WCAG 2.2 success criteria - instead, making products with a solid user experience for _all_ users.

> [!TIP]
> ## Read this first
> - Before going any further, read about how we do [Accessibility on VA.gov](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/accessibility-on-va-gov) and how to follow accessibility standards, while using the [VA Design System](https://design.va.gov/about/accessibility/).

## Your role
At VA.gov, accessibility responsibilities are split between product and support teams. Your role will differ depending on what team you're on.

### Embedded on a product team

<details><summary>Toggle to learn more about embedding on a team :accessibility:</summary>

If you're embedded on a **product team** (a "Veteran-facing service," or "VFS," team), your job is to ensure that your product(s) are as accessible as possible. You should aim to bake accessibility into the design and development process from the beginning ("shift left").

Some embedded team members accessibility specialists, focusing purely on accessibility work. Others are accessibility-minded researchers, designers, developers, or product managers. 

In all cases, you have a pivotal role to play in the accessibility of your team's work!

**Learn more about what different product teams do:**
- The [VFS Product Directory](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/vfs-product-directory) lists all products VFS teams work on and includes information about each product, its product owner, and what Crew it belongs to.
- There's a weekly "Team of Teams" meeting, where all product teams share brief updates. You can join the [#team-of-teams-slide-collection](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C031S5G29LP) Slack channel to review teams' updates.
- This [Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1712621865931/3fea15c7e9e02e067a628b1384dac54f4006bbdb?sender=u1c2b512a71f68e7b5a5c0324) shows how VFS teams are organized. This is, for the most part, an updated list of VA Teams. You can also reference the Team of Teams "Team List Slide", for a up-to-date list of teams. These should give you a good place to start!

### Supporting CAIA's Team

<details><summary>Toggle to learn more about supporting CAIA :accessibility:</summary>

  The **Content, Accessibility, and Information Architecture team** ("CAIA") is a sitewide support team. If you're on CAIA, your role is to support product teams as they build their products. To do this, you will:
- Review products in the design phase for accessibility concerns
- Conduct accessibility audits of products on staging and in production
- Run [assistive technology research pilots](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/CAIA/accessibility/assistive-tech-pilot-guide.md)
- Assist teams with assistive technology research sessions with participants with disabilities
Review CAIA's full [menu of services](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/CAIA/accessibility/README.md#services-we-offer) to learn more.
</details>

### Supporting the Platform Governance team

<details><summary>Toggle to learn about supporting the Governance team :accessibility:</summary>

The [Collaboration Cycle](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/overview) is where teams building products/features on VA.gov get feedback and guidance on their product/feature to ensure it meets VA.gov experience standards. Any new tool, product, or page or substantial change to the user experience of an existing tool/product or page should go through the Collaboration Cycle. 

The **Platform Governance Team** owns the overall Collaboration Cycle process.

If you're on the Governance team, you help ensure VFS teams build products that meet standards, are accessible, and align to create a consistent overall VA.gov experience. You'll review products at [touchpoints](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/touchpoints) across the development lifecycle and provide [feedback](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/must-should-and-consider-framework-for-feedback) to VFS teams using our [defect severity rubric](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/accessibility-defect-severity-rubric).

</details>

## Join the Accessibility Community of Practice (CoP)

We may be decentralized, but we're not alone! Together, VA's accessibility specialists form the **Accessibility Community of Practice (CoP)**. 

The CoP is a group of accessibility specialists and accessibility-minded designers, researchers, and developers from across VA.gov. Members are from CAIA, Governance, and product teams alike. We support each other by answering questions, meeting on a regular basis, and sharing resources. We also help others by answering their accessibility questions on public Slack channels.

### A11y Champs
If you are new to the accessibility space, or know someone that is, check out the [Accessibility Champions Community ("A11y Champs")](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/a11y-champs)! We're a grassroots, volunteer-led educational program intent on scaling up VA.gov's focus on the disabled Veteran experience through:
- co-design, curiosity, and community
- centering the diverse voices of disabled Veterans, caretakers, and family members
- asking questions first and learning from others

Anyone working at the VA, with access to the DSVA slack channel, can become an accessibility champion through this curriculum.

### Tooling
Learn what [tools we use](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/CAIA/accessibility/tools-we-use.md) to audit products on VA.gov. The list includes various plugins, extensions, and applications.

We also recommend installing the new [VA page checker Chrome extension](https://github.com/Mottie/va-page-checker), which highlights design system components and accessibility issues on VA.gov pages.

(**Note:** If you have a GFE Windows PC, you can install JAWS with a VA 508 Office license. Open a [ServiceNow ticket](https://yourit.va.gov/sp?id=va_sc_subcat%E2%8A%82id=a7ff40ec1b352850a25d0d08ec4bcb6f) to create a JAWS installation request.)

### Figma
If you use Figma, make sure to use our [accessibility annotations library](https://design.va.gov/about/accessibility/accessibility-annotations).

You can also use Figma [plugins](https://www.figma.com/community/tag/a11y/plugins/free) to help check color contrast, readability, zoom, etc.

### PDFs
If you've been tasked with creating or remediating a PDF, check out CAIA's [guide to creating accessible PDFs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/CAIA/accessibility/create-accessible-PDF.md).

[Section508.gov's Content Creation page](https://www.section508.gov/create/) has detailed information about making accessible documents, presentations, spreadsheets, and PDFs.

### Forms
Use these resources to create accessible forms on VA.gov:
- [Mock form patterns](https://staging.va.gov/mock-form-patterns/introduction)
