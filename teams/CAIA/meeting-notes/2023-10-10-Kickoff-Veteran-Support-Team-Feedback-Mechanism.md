## About the CAIA Team
### Platform Governance Team
The Platform Governance Team assists teams specifically through the Collaboration Style, to the launch of a product, via design intent, midpoint review and staging review. 

### Content Accessibility and Information Architecture (CAIA)
CAIA’s  job is to make sure VFS teams are ready for those incremental steps of the Collaboration Cycle, through a partnership with CAIA's three different disciplines. CAIA can work async or embed with VFS teams, depending on the project. 
- **Content Team:** can help with plain language
- **Information Architecture Team:** can help it make sense
- **Accessibility Team:** can help to make sure your product is accessible
