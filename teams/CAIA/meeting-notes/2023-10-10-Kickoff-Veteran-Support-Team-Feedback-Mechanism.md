## About the CAIA Team
### Platform Governance Team
The Platform Governance Team assists teams specifically through the Collaboration Style, to the launch of a product, via design intent, midpoint review and staging review. 

### Content Accessibility and Information Architecture (CAIA)
CAIA‚Äôs  job is to make sure VFS teams are ready for those incremental steps of the Collaboration Cycle, through a partnership with CAIA's three different disciplines. CAIA can work async or embed with VFS teams, depending on the project. 
- **Content Team:** can help with plain language
- **Information Architecture Team:** can help it make sense
- **Accessibility Team:** can help to make sure your product is accessible

## Discussion Notes‚úçÔ∏è

### Project
- Tool is staged on the live site: Resource & Support page ‚Üí sign in to va.gov
- Call center gets a lot of questions about where/how to log in
- Laura: other Medallia form has open text box and had to put a note not to include PII, so we‚Äôll need to think about that for this too.

#### Problems
- **Medallia constraints (Camille):** They have 508 capability but not a11y approved for va.gov (version 2 might have legends and fieldsets).
- **Engineer on their team asked about unordered list requirements**, since fieldsets and legends aren‚Äôt available.
- **Big concern:** ensure it aligns with prototype. Had trouble with prototype in sketch (using accordion) so moving it to Figma. Walked through it with Naomi and it felt clunky.

#### CAIA
- **Content**
    - Laura: other Medallia form has open text box and had to put a note not to include PII, so we‚Äôll need to think about that for this too.
- **IA** 
    - None
- **Accessibility**
  - **Design Intent - Key take aways**:
      - Think about impact for when Veterans do the least amount of effort in submitting feedback how will this info be useful?
      - Understand and communicate third party limitations and ensure a11y is okay for VA standards.
