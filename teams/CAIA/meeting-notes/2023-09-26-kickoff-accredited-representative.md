## About the CAIA Team
### Platform Governance Team
The Platform Governance Team will assist you specifically through the Collaboration Style, to the launch of your product, via design intent, midpoint review and staging review. 

### Content Accessibility and Information Architecture (CAIA)
CAIA‚Äôs  job is to make sure you are ready for those incremental steps, by partnering with you via our three different disciplines. We can work async or embed depending on the project.

## Discussion Notes‚úçÔ∏è

### Project MVP
- Searching and selecting and filling out a form.
    - Searching and Selecting a Representative
    - Filling out a form to request the representative to be POA
#### Problems
- How much can we tweak the legal copy, so that it is easy to use, but doesn‚Äôt lose the impact of what the initial form is asking. 
- Finalize text before usability testing (next quarter)
#### CAIA Content
- **General Content Review**
    - ‚û°Ô∏è**Action Item**: Review Needed
    - We can help with drafting plain language.
    - How much you are allowed to change would have to go to the SME who is in charge of this form/process.
    - ‚û°Ô∏è**Action Item**: Identify the SME
    - ‚û°Ô∏è**Action Item**: Laura can check for similar legal speak project examples (before and after).
- **IA Needed** 
    - ‚û°Ô∏è**Action Item**: Review Needed
- **Accessibility** :accessibility:
