### Project: Request Summary
#### Intake Request [#66578](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/66578)
We are updating the 527EZ pension form to align to the most recent version of the paper form. This includes adding missing fields and removing depreciated fields. 
The current online form will be (or has been) deactivated to prevent Veterans from submitting claims online that cannot be processed without additional development, so there is a sense of urgency in getting the updated version of the form back online.

- **Content**
    -  Collaboration on content if your team does not have a dedicated content writer - assistance requested in the intake
    -  Midpoint and staging support requested.

- **IA** 
    - **User Flows** - assistance requested in the intake
    - **Entry points** - special Sketch file for this

- **Accessibility**
  - Accessibility review of wireframes and/or prototypes - assistance requested in the intake
  - Review and receive Sketch files from team when received.
  - No audit ever done before - the team could benefit from an a11y audit.
  - Research will take place in 2024 post launch, due to timing.
  - Midpoint support and staging prep support requested
 
## Additional Detail/Notes
- Entry points to the product need to be reviewed.
- User flow conversation will be needed early on (Kristin/Jenny)
- Fiorella Geedi - has Sketch files available - the latest files are in the ‚Äúproposed‚Äù section it is the latest row and would say updated and have a comment.
- Sketch files to be provided by Fiorella - separate file for user flows, and another for the new designed.
- **Context for this Priority**: The paper form and the form being worked on now is going to be deactivated. So this is a priority item for us right now. The plug hasn‚Äôt been pulled, just yet. Any Veteran filling out the online form today, will have to fill out in paper, so that is the time factor.
- Audit needed for this form, it has never been audited before for accessibility.
- Research will be done post launch due to time, but notes will be taken during the process to launch for what needs to be done.(Likely 2024).
