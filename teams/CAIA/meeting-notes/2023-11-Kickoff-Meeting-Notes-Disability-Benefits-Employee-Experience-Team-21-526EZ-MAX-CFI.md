### CAIA Intake Ticket Request Description

>We are working on an intervention to help dissuade Veterans from applying for to increase benefits (A claim for increase, or CFI) for tinnitus when they are already receiving the maximum amount of benefits. We have a few specific requests for the CAIA team:
>In our design concept, we have an additional page, outside of the online 526 flow, that provides more information about what it means to submit a CFI when you're already at the maximum. We need help figuring out where this page should live in the information architecture of va.gov, as well as best practices for having people access this information from within the 526 flow).
>We would like some review of the content of this more info page for consistency with style guide. It's worth noting that this tested well in our discovery research, so we would want to balance any new changes with what seemed to work for users.
>(Potentially) Accessibility assistance on modifications to a checkbox tile to allow us to show the a link to the new information within the tile.
>Our next step is to finalize our designs for usability testing in CodePen, including people who use AT Provide date if available: usability testing dates not set yet, either early December or sometime in January
