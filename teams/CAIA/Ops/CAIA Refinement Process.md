## Overview

### Purpose of this document
This document serves as an instruction set and guidance for conducting CAIA operations refinement.

### Purpose of CAIA Ops Refinement
CAIA ops refinement focuses on adjusting, estimating, and ranking intake tickets in "New Stuff", "Backlog" and "Blocked" by using priority. Adjustments can be small things like adding descriptions and large edits like splitting or breaking an intake out into specific tasks. Effective refinement of intake tickets in a clear, well-understood manner, along with input from OCTO leadership, helps the team know what is the highest-priority.

It is important to revisit items in blocked and backlog to ensure items do not get left in perpetuity.

Refinement is an essential part of the effective management and prioritization of work and allows for awareness and planning of new tickets as they  enter the CAIA pipeline.
The primary outcomes of CAIA Ops Refinement can be summarized as:
- Reviewing all new intake requests in "New Stuff" column
- Simplification of user stories/ticket requirements ensuring we are working on the highest-priority tasks during each sprint
- Filling out ticket custom fields with relevant data
- Refined intake tickets should be:
  - clear enough, so they understand what VFS teams or stakeholders are asking for and why they are asking for it.
  - Small enough, so the items should be small enough to get done within a sprint or to comply with the definition of done.

### Refinement frequency
CAIA Ops Refinement is carried out every Monday at 3PM ET.
