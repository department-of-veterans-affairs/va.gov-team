## Overview

### Purpose of this document
This document serves as an instruction set and guidance for conducting CAIA operations refinement.

### Purpose of CAIA Ops Refinement
CAIA ops refinement focuses on adjusting, estimating, and ranking intake tickets in "New Stuff", "Backlog" and "Blocked" by using priority. Adjustments can be small things like adding descriptions and large edits like splitting or breaking an intake out into specific tasks. Effective refinement of intake tickets in a clear, well-understood manner, along with input from OCTO leadership, helps the team know what is the highest-priority.

It is important to revisit items in blocked and backlog to ensure items do not get left in perpetuity.

Refinement is an essential part of the effective management and prioritization of work and allows for awareness and planning of new tickets as they  enter the CAIA pipeline.
The primary outcomes of CAIA Ops Refinement can be summarized as:
- Reviewing all new intake requests in "New Stuff" column.
- Simplification of user stories/ticket requirements ensuring we are working on the highest-priority tasks during each sprint.
- Filling out ticket custom fields with relevant data.
- Refined intake tickets should be:
  - clear enough, so they understand what VFS teams or stakeholders are asking for and why they are asking for it.
  - Small enough, so the items should be small enough to get done within a sprint or to comply with the definition of done.

### Refinement frequency
CAIA Ops Refinement is carried out every Monday at 3PM ET.

### Who participates in refinement?
The following roles particiapte in CAIA Ops refinement.
- CAIA Project Manager.
- CAIA Scrum Master/Product Manager.
- CAIA Discipline Leads.
- OCTO Discipline Leads.

## Process
There are 3 key objectives for refinement:
1. Asses and order issues depending on priority.
2. Provide visibility to CAIA team for work to be done.
3. Ensure items in blocked and backlog do not go stale and get forgotten.

### Order of operations
Using Github Project, navigate to the [main board](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/929/views/1)
The default view for this is newest items are at the top.

1. Run through the **New Intakes** column first.
    - Assign estimate, priority, and last checked fields. OCTO will help determine priority level.
    - Add comments to help signify action taken or decision made.
    - Update "Last checked" field with today's date.
    - If the ticket is related to HEALTH, triage whether it goes to Sara Sterkenberg (Cartography team) or Kristin Ouellette (CAIA)
         -   If the url of the tool/page starts with /health-care/, it goes to Kristin (tag Kristin and Sitewide IA)
         -   If the url starts with myhealth, it goes to Sara (tag Sara and Cartography team)

3. Next, run through **Blocked** column starting with items items with the oldest "last checked" date.
    - Determine if item is still blocked.
    - Determine if priority level has changed.
    - Update estimate if applicable.
    - Update "Last checked" field with today's date.
    - Add comments to help signify action taken or decision made.

4. Then, run through **Backlog** column starting with items items with the oldest "last checked" date.
    - Determine if item is still blocked.
    - Determine if priority level has changed.
    - Update estimate if applicable.
    - Update "Last checked" field with today's date.
    - Add comments to help signify action taken or decision made.

## Glossary of terms

### Priority levels

1. **Urgent** - Should be started immediately.
2. **High** - Should be started ASAP.
3. **Medium** - Not quite high but above normal.
4. **Normal** - Default for all new items.
5. **Chipper** - An item that is not high priority that can be worked on as time allows.
6. **Low** - Should be worked on after higher priority items.
7. **Icebox** - Items that cannot be closed but are not actively being worked on or are indefinelely delayed or blocked.
