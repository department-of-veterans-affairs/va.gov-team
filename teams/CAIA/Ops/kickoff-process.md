## Overview

### Kickoff Purpose 🤷‍♂️

#### What is the purpose of this document? 📄

This document is designed to serve as a guide for how the Sitewide Content, Accessibility, and Information Architecture (**CAIA**) Team conducts and organizes kickoff meetings with VFS teams, and serve as a source of information for teams regarding what to expect during the kickoff process. Ultimately, the purpose of this document is to make the kickoff process with CAIA clear and easy for VFS teams to navigate.

#### Why does my team need a kickoff meeting? 📆

After submitting [an intake request form with CAIA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=strelichl%2C+coforma-terry&labels=sitewide+CAIA%2C+sitewide+content-product+support&projects=&template=sitewide-content-intake-form.md&title=%3CType+of+Request%3E+from+%3CTeam%3E) it is often helpful for our team to meet with yours to get a better understanding as to how we can "kickoff" our work together and collaborate most effectively. 
- It also gives us an opportunity to ask and answer questions or clarify details.
    - Sometimes this information is a little hard to discern from an intake form alone.
- **New products or product phase:** A kickoff meeting is particularly useful if you and your team are working on a new product or phase - for example, a new form or a new tool.
- **Projects involving content, IA and accessibility support:** For work that involves multiple disciplines, a kickoff is the best way to align and plan work.
- **Small updates:** Small changes may still require a kickoff, depending on factors such as team maturity or OCTO priorities.

### Timeframe ⏲️

#### How can I schedule a kickoff meeting with CAIA?

After you submit your [CAIA intake ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=strelichl%2C+coforma-terry&labels=sitewide+CAIA%2C+sitewide+content-product+support&projects=&template=sitewide-content-intake-form.md&title=%3CType+of+Request%3E+from+%3CTeam%3E) ...
- [ ] Reach out to us in our [DSVA Slack chanel](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C01K37HRUAH), and we can set something up. 
- [ ] CAIA will create the initial meeting invite, but we will leave it up to you to include the appropriate members of your team.

_Please also note that due to the volume of teams we work with, please allow at least a week for us to get prepped for the meeting._

#### When are the CAIA kickoff meetings?

- The CAIA Team has time set aside each week:
    - Kickoff meetings will be held on Wednesdays between 12:00 and 1:00 PM ET.
    - There are two, 30-minute-slots available each week.
- Once a kickoff meeting has been scheduled, CAIA will share it on the [CAIA Shared Calender](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_ddb0b99f3fdacd4cbbee5c9352654daa0a32b7d1f1b56d67bef0773e8eb6191a%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FChicago)

### Kickoff Prep 📝

#### What do I need to do to prepare for our kickoff with CAIA?

Reading through this document is a great start, particularly the section that explains what CAIA does. 

**Afterwards, the following checklist is useful:**
- [ ] Have I invited everyone on my team who needs to be on the kickoff?
- [ ] Do I have links to all my product/project artifacts (such as Mural or Figma files) in the intake ticket prior to kickoff?

#### When can I expect feedback from CAIA?

We guide and work alongside teams across nearly every OCTO digital product. We also work with partners across VA to lead content migration and manage all unauthenticated content on VA.gov. And we're always working to expand the VA.gov content style guide and our IA and accessibility documentation. We need to prioritize all intake requests based on our overall workload and VA and OCTO priorities.

_Tell us about your product's timeline. And we'll work with you to meet timeline needs as best we can._

### Kickoff Steps 👟

**Below is the process for setting up a CAIA kickoff meeting:**

- [ ] Make sure you have submitted an intake request ticket using [this template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=strelichl%2C+coforma-terry&labels=sitewide+CAIA%2C+sitewide+content-product+support&projects=&template=sitewide-content-intake-form.md&title=%3CType+of+Request%3E+from+%3CTeam%3E)
- [ ] If you have worked with us before, or you are not launching a new product that is going through the collaboration cycle, then use this ["General Collab Request"](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=coforma-terry%2Cstrelichl&labels=sitewide+CAIA&projects=&template=caia-general-collab-request.md&title=%5BCAIA+General+Support%5D%3A%3CTeam+name%3E%3CSupport+Needed%3E) ticket instead.
- [ ] Let us know in our [DSVA Slack Channel](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C01K37HRUAH) that you have submitted an intake request ticket.
- [ ] Someone on the CAIA team will respond in that Slack channel and see if we need to spin up a kickoff meeting.
- [ ] Attend the kickoff with CAIA!

### Next Steps 🦶

#### What are the outcomes of the kickoff with CAIA?

During your kickoff meeting, we'll get to know more about your team and what we need to partner on. Together, we'll identify what the next steps will be for your team and from CAIA. Depending on the scope of your project, we may need to schedule a follow-up meeting. 

The meeting will be recording and we'll link to it in the ticket as well as document what the next steps are.

# How we collaborate with your team

If your team has dedicated content, IA, or accessibility experts, we’ll support their work. If you don’t have dedicated experts in these areas, we’ll collaborate with your designers, researchers, and other team members.

If you’re going through the VA.gov Collaboration Cycle, we can help you prepare for your touchpoints with the Platform Governance Team and make changes based on their feedback. 

## Content 

### What the CAIA Content Team does

<details><summary>Toggle to learn what the CAIA Content Team does</summary>
  
- Collaborate with VFS teams on content for all Veteran-facing products on VA.gov
- Create, maintain, and update all unauthenticated static pages in the benefit hubs and resources and support section of VA.gov 
- Manage the translation of content into Spanish and Tagalog
- Maintain the VA.gov content style guide and help align content across the VA.gov ecosystem with the VA content standards
</details>

### How CAIA the Content Team can collaborate with your team

<details><summary>Toggle to learn how the CAIA Content Team can collaborate with your team</summary>

- Work with your designers, researchers, and content specialist (if you have one on your team) to create or update content for interactive tools and online forms
- Create or update static pages on VA.gov to support your team’s product (including adding entry points and adjusting informational content based on product changes)
- Consult on research plans and conversation guides to help dig into content issues in testing—and help make updates to your content based on your findings

</details>

## Information Architecture

Teams are rightfully focused on designing and releasing their specific thing, but they often don’t have time or context to dig into the broad IA implications for their new or changed product. 

<details><summary>Toggle to learn how the CAIA Information Architecture Team can help your team.</summary>

CAIA IA makes sure that Veterans and family can find the products, and that the overall IA of the site directs them to their top needs. When a new product launches, we help with the following:<br>
- **User journey, entry points, and important relationships**: What triggers a veteran/user needing this product, and how will they know it exists and find it? What areas on the site will link to this product? What other products or pages should crosslink to this product?
- **Page placement**: where will the page live in our va.gov sitemap and why?
- **URLs and Breadcrumbs**: what should the URL be and why?
- **Redirects**: is this product replacing a page that we need to redirect?Note that if we are redirecting content or tools from legacy pages (eBenefits, the ‘old’ VA websites), a lot of stakeholder coordination is needed with those folks. Connect with those stakeholders early!
- **Best Bets:** If you go to va.gov/search and type in ‘pension’, you’ll see 2 results under “our top recommendations”.  We can help set up which URLS appear under top recs for different keywords, helping your page be more findable in search results

## Accessibility

Our goal, as CAIA A11ys, is to empower teams to deliver the most accessible products possible for Veterans. We do this by providing teams with insights, training, and support as accessibility subject matter experts.

We are here to partner with you and provide guidance on how to achieve accessible outcomes.

### How CAIA a11ys can help your team with accessibility

<details><summary>Toggle to learn how CAIA A11ys can help your team</summary>

The Content, Accessibility, and Information Architecture team, or CAIA, is a cross-functional team of folks here to help your team deliver the highest quality product possible to Veterans.Below you will find some of the ways that CAIA can help your team with accessibility.

### How CAIA A11ys relate to the Collaboration Cycle

<details><summary>Toggle to learn how CAIA A11ys differ from the Collaboration Cycle</summary>

We've grouped our offerings by how they relate to the touch point meetings in the Collaboration Cycle. We've done this because the Collaboration Cycle is a well-known process for our community, and maps well to how we do work.

Note that CAIA can assist teams going through the Collaboration Cycle, but CAIA is not involved in the [Collaboration Cycle](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/) directly. 
- We are here to help you launch the best products possible, we're not gatekeepers.
- If we find and flag an issue we can't and won't block you from launching.
- Teams going through the Collaboration Cycle can work with us, as can teams working outside of it

### CAIA A11y service detail

<details><summary>Toggle to view the CAIA A11y menu of services details</summary>

#### Research support

We can help you plan your research sessions, ensuring that they are equitable and account for important accessibility factors. When it comes time to run research sessions we can also provide technical support for research participants who rely on assistive technology, like screen readers. During the research sessions, we also observe and take notes, with an eye to accessibility. Once the research has concluded, we provide a robust deliverable containing accessibility findings and recommendations to the research team.

#### Accessibility test planning

We can work with a team to develop an accessibility-focused testing plan so that during design and development you are able to continually ensure that your product is accessible. We can help develop the plan, and walk you through how to run the tests. We have experience creating plans for both automated and manual testing.

#### Support design discovery

We can work with you and your team during design discovery to ensure that accessibility considerations are being taken into account, and help to flag when something may be veering away from the accessible happy path.<br>

#### Review wireframes and prototypes

We can review your static wireframes or interactive prototypes looking for potential accessibility issues. We can also work with you and advise on how to annotate designs to ensure that they are easy to implement in an accessible way.<br>

#### PDF audit

We can review PDF documents for accessibility, and help advise on how to remediate any issues found.

#### Staging audit

We can review products in staging, testing with assistive technology, reviewing for accessibility best practices, and ensuring that the product meets OCTO-DE accessibility experience standards. We can also help you prepare the required accessibility testing artifact for the Collaboration Cycle.

#### Health check audit

This is very much like a staging review but done in production! This is useful for older products that were implemented and released before certain standards were put into place.

#### Training and education

We can provide training and resources for you and your team on accessibility best practices and methodologies above and beyond what Governance offers at onboarding. Also, don't miss the accessibility champs program!

#### Spot checks, general guidance

We are always here for more general, off-the-cuff questions! Never hesitate to reach out to us on the DSVA Slack in either the #accessibility-help or the #sitewide-content-accessibility-ia channels.
