### Community guidelines are still a work in progress üë©‚Äçüç≥

- Charlotte introduced the topic of community guidelines, she'll be working on a workshop in the near future
- Lydia suggested Press Press as a resource to reference

### How do we build safety into the Perigean recruitment processes for Veterans? üè°

- Josh shared a redacted story on a Veteran's experience in the Perigean recruitment process and asked the group, "What do the power dynamics look like, what does safety look like, do the participants have ways to provide feedback?"
- Cindy said that she would like to hear what went on from Perigean‚Äôs end. She had found out that they are sending out surveys with only one response per question which may confuse participants; then Perigean assumes that if you respond to the question that you agree with what was stated. They have said that they won't do this anymore.
- Lydia suggested that we try to make changes from the relationship and make sure that we do not inflict the harm on the Perigean employee that we are trying to avoid inflicting on participants.
- We then talked about our relationship with Perigean.  If we make too many requests of our Perigean contact it gets escalated up the Perigean chain. Also the relationship with Perigean goes through VA OCTO, specifically Shane Strassberg. It was difficult to get access to Veterans in the past and we have heard that the access we do have was hard to set up; we don‚Äôt have a lot of insight into the relationship with Perigean or the vetting process for the vendor.

### What's our purpose? What are y'all yearning for? üíô

- At the end Lydia asked about what the purpose of this meeting is and if we want to present to the Monday design meeting.
- Charlotte, Lydia, and Josh met up afterwards to discuss this. We'll check in with the community first on what each of our individual expectations are (we'll be running a small activity on May 1st).

## Action Items
- [ ] Charlotte, Lydia, and Josh plan May 1st activity

## Shoutouts
Special thanks to Lydia for filling in for Tyler! I love seeing how we're able to support each other. Life (and moving) is _exhausting_ especially when the wifi doesn't cooperate, but that's why we have each other.

And super special thanks to Megan for being our scribe! All these notes above? That's Megan. If you see her around, let her know she's awesome üòé
