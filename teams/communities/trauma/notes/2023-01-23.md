## Key Summary

### 4 patterns emerged from our conversation around our purpose 🧭

1. Onboard new practitioners 👋
2. Share knowledge and practice skills together 🪴
3. Support, debrief, and listen to one another 👂
4. Strategize for trauma-responsive futures 🤔

### Now, we want to… 

- Continue open trauma meetings to focus on strategy, broadly share knowledge, welcome new members and be responsive to events.
- Plan our next series of small groups, to provide a deeper space to share knowledge and practice skills around specific topics in a safer space. 
- Begin to organize introductory onboarding materials for new members. Like a 2-3 step plan to become more trauma sensitive and ready to join smaller groups.

### Next, we want to…

- Collaborate with the platform team to standardize trauma-informed considerations and methods into our design and research process and communities.
- Define how we can ramp up to become a more trauma informed practice over time. Referencing other maturity models (e.g. Gov CX maturity model) may prove valuable.

### Later, we want to..

- Deeply examine the life cycle of projects on VA.gov teams from the scoping, to storytelling, and everything in between.
- Document our work and the effort it takes to begin tying it to value propositions the government can respond to.
- Improve how we write our contracting requirements and institutionalize expectations for contracting partners around trauma informed work.

## Ways we’re thinking of meeting 🤝

### Big meetings (every other week) 👐

- Audience: Public and open to anyone interested
- Purpose: Welcome in new members, take on topics as needed, and discuss strategy for our community transparently

### Small support groups (scheduled as needed by organizers) 🫶

- Audience: Small groups of 7 folk (at this point usually researchers) who are actively doing the work
- Purpose: Create a mindful, tender space that prioritizes privacy and safety for folk to deeply reflect, share, listen, learn from, and support one another.

### Drop in hours (every week, but pending) 🩺

- Audience: Public and open to anyone doing the work
- Purpose: Provide a consistent, open space for folk to debrief and get support

## Action Items
- [ ] Martha (or any other volunteer) to facilitate the next trauma meeting on the 6th. This will focus on showcasing what the trauma sensitive to responsive journey looks like and to continue our conversation on drop-in hours.
- [x] Josh to write a summary of today’s meeting
- [ ] Reflect on our identities (who’s represented… and who isn’t? How does that affect our practice?)
- [ ] Start scheduling next rounds of small groups 
  - [ ] Josh to find 2 organizers to lead the next 2 small groups
