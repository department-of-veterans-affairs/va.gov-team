## Key summary

### An unideal start to a sensitive topic
- The research was kicked off by a mandate from congress to VBA (Benefits) to make a journey map on the MST experience by interviewing Veterans with MST, which Karen had disagreements with in concern of re-traumatizing Veterans.
- VBA is less customer-focused and more rules-based (making sure things are legally right) compared to VHA
- Karen started with desk research, citing information and conversations already existing in the public (e.g. Reddit, public forums, etc)
- VBA, however, insisted on interviews
- Before agreeing to undertake the project, Karen consulted with 4-5 different colleagues. She asked: what‚Äôs my role here? How do I stay in my role? What am I protected for? Legally? With my license?

### Setting boundaries and conditions with VBA
Karen agreed to do the work provided the following conditions were met:
- VBA had ‚Äúskin in the game,‚Äù by asking them to find participants and get their consent
- The research was laser-focused on just the claims process, and not the Veteran‚Äôs experience with MST
- There was as much informed consent as possible, with safety being an absolute priority
- The first half of the research would be conducted just with trained social care workers (Karen and Adam)
  - The way designers are trained conflicts against social care practice norms; in other words, we‚Äôre not set up to do trauma-informed work by default
  - E.g., social care workers are trained to provide information and answers to questions, not deflect or ‚Äúmhmm‚Äù it away as a neutral party

### Building trust and transparency with participants early and often 
- Karen went over the specifics of her study at least 3 times with participants by email, personal call, and within the interview itself.
- The traumatized brain has more difficulty inputting new information. Reiterating information on what you‚Äôre doing, why you‚Äôre doing it, is critical.
- In the first email, Karen gave in writing what they were doing, and what they were not doing with instructions on how to withdraw at any moment in time. 
@Martha Wilkes
 noted that this would be safer than putting Veterans on the spot to respond to a request.
- Karen gave choice to the participants on researcher identity as well, not just tech setup and time.
- She also prepared a resource guide on the VA ahead of time to be equipped to answer any questions Veterans pose.

### There‚Äôs still many open questions
- When should a research topic should go through IRB or not?
- How do we keep OUR practitioners safe?
