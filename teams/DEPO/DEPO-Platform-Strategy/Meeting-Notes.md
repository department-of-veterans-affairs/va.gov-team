# CMS

## Questions

- Any plans for Q1 planning?
  - Not on CMS side

- I don't see any OKRs around around ensuring the quality of content produced via the CMS. Is that a part of the mission? (That necessary friction for editors that we've discussed in the past?)

- Does the vision for the evolution of the CMS product include modularizing content so the same source content can be served up in multiple locations? (mobile, FAQs, chatbots, etc)

- If you look at the proposed DEPO Platform mission, how do you think the CMS does/doesn't align? What parts of the proposed mission feel off given the mission of the CMS product?

What is LC?
- Learning Center, which is now Resources and Support

- Who does CMS define as a "user"? Do you use the word "customer" for anything?
  - customer = VFS Team (like public websites team for example)
  - user = editor
  - customer framing is tough bc customers are usually entities that pay for a good or service, it's an imperfect term

- How might we create a streamlined process between a single source of truth for a design component and changes or additions brought about by content model changes in that component?
  - In Q1 could we look at a content model change that resulted in a design change?
  - Sounds like as VFS teams have new needs, the editing experience is built around that. The VFS updates drive decisions about what design components are used to present those, and they differ from the designs for the same components in the Design System.
  - Design System is always in motion, as content needs are defined by CMS team they're eval'ed and worked in.
  - At min need awareness so if something is happening in a content model that would affect a design component, we're aware of that
  - In order for CMS and content model and components in CMS to be effective, it needs less flexibility at the design system implementation level. Need to re-use this thing, and if we need to enhance it for some reason we can, but everyone's using the same thing. But the Design System isn't built that way, it's not like "I need an FAQ page, or a search result box" but it's the elements for that thing that are available. Design System is meant to be intentless and stateless.
  - VSP folks have defined governance around variance, CMS has done a thing called Child Systems (child design system based on healthcare.gov based on CMS design system). Maybe we could use the child system model to create a CMS Design System and technical solution is if we use web components w/highest level def of component, we could create sub-variants and it wouldn't be react specific or anything like that.
  - Could we explore having a child system / web components idea (or other idea to same problem) to value matrix and discuss in both CMS and VSP Q1 planning
  - Have Design System team do a regression audit on tables on public content
  - Explore how to "ship it to everywhere at once" idea for new/updated Design System components
  - "Greatest hits list" to coordinate across VA.gov experience (incl public content)
  - Invite Oksana and David into planning rituals for teams who'd be most 
  - CMS team has communicated that it's a challenge that the govt isn't telling them what the priorities are
  - How can we agree on the priorities?

- Collab cycle: how do we treat that for unauth teams?
  - Collab cycle (for PW eg) makes them caught in a position of doing collab cycle w/2 different teams. One for CMS and one for code, design, etc. Need content model updated, transformer updated. If we want CMS and VSP closer, need collab cycle for unauth teams to have steps for CMS needs.
  - Platform owns the relationship of teams trying to build things on VA.gov, and CMS team is almost in the way sometimes of Jen shipping something.
  - Kev Walsh + Kev Hoff have mapped out collab cycle and slot in where CMS might fit in, also KH has segmentation research


- How can we better coordinate? It shouldn't be up to eng on the 2 teams to determine priorities


## Action items
- [ ] Get that mapp from KW and KH to the Collab Cycle team, and schedule follow up meeting about CMS collab cycle steps we want to try out
- [ ] Align on consistent terms/language across teams (user, customer, editor, end-user, VFS Team, etc)
- [ ] Rachael meet with Jeff Barnes, Oksana Cyrwus, and David Addison to coordinate Q1 planning
- [ ] Rachael schedule follow up with Kevin H and Jeff B to better define possible CMS/Design System/FE Tool initiatives prior to roadmapping

## Initiatives that would need cross-collaboration
1. Web components
1. Parent and child design system model
1. A “ship it to everywhere at once” feature for new design system components
1. A “greatest hits” audit + revision initiative to make content and react experiences consistent for top priority parts of VA.gov 
1. Full site preview functionality for content editors
1. Broken link prevention and resolution
1. Redirect strategy
1. CMS-related VFS interactions in collab cycle

# Chatbot

## Questions

- Is Chatbot in fact a VSP product? 

- Any plans for Q1 planning?

- Do you currently use terminology like "user" or "customer"?

- How might we agree on priorities?

- How might chatbot fit in (or not) to the collaboration cycle?
