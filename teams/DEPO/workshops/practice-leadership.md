# Practice leadership workshop brief

## Problem space brief

5/6/2021

We have a handful of highly skilled individuals on the OCTO-DE side who are experts in a given field (notably content, accessibility, IA, and design) and whom we look to as the protectors of those practices on VA.gov. The term "practice lead" came about organically, grassroots-style, as a way to describe and wrap heads around these people and their role here, however there was never an intentional OCTO-DE creation of this role nor a conscious accepting of this role by these individuals. There's never been any explicit definition of what it means to have this role - what the expectations and responsibilities are, what the needs are for success, and really whether it's indeed these peoples' role at all. All of this results in mismatched understandings of what practice leads and Collab Cycle members or VFS Teams or VA.gov members at large expect of each other, and has been the source of much confusion and frustration.

### Examples:

**Practice lead pain:**
- Practice leads are being put in an arbitration position: a VFS team builds a thing that doesn't meet our standards, and we look to the practice leads to be the enforcers. But these individuals don't have the bandwidth, or in some cases the desire, to play that role.
- Due to the squishy responsibilities and potentially some overlap between practice leads and collab cycle team member, practice leads at times have been asked to provide content reviews, and they have to guide VFS folks to go through the collab cycle and thus get the content reviews through the Collab Cycle team member instead.

**Collab cycle member pain:**
- Collab Cycle members are at times expected to fulfill responsibilities that are out of scope: the chatbot team had been working with content practice area leads to get input on their content, but when the practice leads' bandwidth got too tight, they sought Peggy's help with content strategy and creation instead. It's taxing to have to either pick up that extra work because they want to be helpful, or alternatively explain that essentially there's no one to help and the team's out of luck.
- Practice leads were working on content strategy for Claims/Appeals NOD, but the VFS team continued with their Collab Cycle process and got a content review before the practice leads had wrapped up their part. Again, the squishiness around what VFS teams should expect of practice leads vs collab cycle members and how those expectations intersect led in this case to Peggy spending time and energey crafting feedback that will likely need to be redone.

**VFS team pain**



## How might we...
_...define what kind of practice leadership responsibilities are needed in our ecosystem, what is needed for someone to be **successful** at those responsibilities, in what ways the current individuals who've been tagged by others with this role **do** and **do not** desire to assume those responsibilities, where those responsibilities may overlap, conflict with, or compliment Collab Cycle responsibilities, and thus where we have gaps that OCTO-DE will need to figure out how to fill?_
