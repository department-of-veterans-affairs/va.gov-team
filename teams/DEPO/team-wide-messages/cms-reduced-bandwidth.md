## CMS Product Support Reduced Bandwidth

Sharing this information for clarity and for broad awareness: due to tight funding and some tough calls we had to make on what to prioritize with limited bandwidth, **starting May 10th, 2021 the CMS Product Support team will have reduced capacity for the foreseeable future.** We hope this is a temporary situation, and will communicate updates in Slack if anything changes.

Here are the impacts of this reduced capacity:
- CMS Help desk support hours will change to 9am-5pm ET (from our current 8am-8pm). They'll have only one help desk manager on staff, so response times and resolution times may be a bit slower depending on volume at the time.
- They'll have reduced capacity to support VFS teams building products and onboarding new content to the CMS. Please work with Dave Conlon, the CMS Product Support PO, to prioritize requests so we have single-threaded decision-making.
- Their engineers will be stretched a bit thin, so please direct support requests to the #cms-support channel rather than directly contacting CMS engineers, particularly for non-emergency requests.
