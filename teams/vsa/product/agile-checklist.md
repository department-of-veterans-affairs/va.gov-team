Use this checklist to assist you with your Ceremonies and process. 

## Stand Up

1. Log in at least 1 minute before the meeting.
2. Open and share the Zenhub board so tasks can be seen.
3. Pick someone to start.
4. Remind the team of 3 question format if it hasn’t been followed recently.
5. End within 15 minutes, making sure everyone has had a chance to speak. 

## Sprint Planning 

**Pre-Planning**

1. Open the Capacity Tracker and have it ready to share. 
2. Pull up past velocity for review. 
3. Verify that the columns past Current Sprint and In Progress are empty.
4. Log in at least 1 minute before the meeting. 

**Planning**

1. Kickoff the call once everyone joins and go over the velocity of the past Sprint. This will give the team an idea on how many Stories they think they can complete in the upcoming Sprint.
2. Go over the team Capacity by getting everyone’s availability over the next Sprint.
3. Speak about and display the goal of the Sprint. 
4. Share Zenhub board for team and start with the Backlog (this is usually the Ready Column but may start at the Backlog Column).
5. Starting with highest priority User Story:
    1. Make sure the Story is clear and see if anyone has questions about it.
    1. Have team decide who will work on item.
    1. Move to Current Sprint Column.
    1. Create tasks for the User Story and estimate hours per task.

**Implementation**

1. After User Stories are committed to, check with the capacity tracker to confirm that the team is not over or under committed. 
2. Verify with team and get commitment that this is the work they will complete during the Sprint. 

## Backlog Grooming/Refinement

1. Prior to meeting, add new User Stories if they have not been added yet. 
2. Open the team Zenhub board, and start with the next Issues that are not in the current Sprint.
3. Allow the PO to present the goal for the next Sprint. If not the PO, then you will provide the goal of the next Sprint. 
4. Go through each Story:
    1. Add new tasks.
    1. Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
    1. Change priority.
    1. Change Acceptance Criteria if needed.
5. Confirm with the team that the Backlog looks ready for the next two Sprints.



## Sprint Retrospective

**Pre-Planning**

1. Setup a new Retrospective Board with columns using techniques such as: The Standard 3 Questions (What went well, what didn’t go well, what can we improve?), The 4 L’s (Liked, Lacked, Learned, Longed For), or the Starfish (More Of, Less Of, Keep Doing, Start Doing, Stop Doing).

**Review**

1. Open and review the previous retrospective action items. Discuss and confirm if they were completed or not.
2. Unfinished items may be brought into the next Sprint.

**Facilitate**

1. Start the timer for 5 - 10 minutes to allow the team to fill out the Retro board. 
2. Once finished, share the board and start discussing each item. If you have many items, you may need to have your team members vote on which 3 items they want to discuss the most.
3. Be sure to read out each item and ask for the team to speak about it. Try not to speak about items yourself. Remain a neutral facilitator.
4. As the team discusses items, try to work with them to create action items. 
5. As a team, choose about 2 to 4 Action Items to complete next Sprint.
6. Make sure each action item is well defined, assigned to a specific team member to be held accountable, and can be completed before the end of the next Sprint ends.
