Tze: 
Staging review scheduling: 
As a regular process, check in with Tze a week prior to opening the staging review ticket, or when you open the ticket , have artifacts in and tag Tze 1 week in advance. This makes it possible for Tze to get to it w/o being rushed (2day before meeting).

Give 1 week notice prior to opening staging review ticket. 
tag Tze in ticket, also tag him in slack. Things get lost in the process.

Utlize "Use cases template" and provide to Tze
usability testing review ticket - include use cases document
