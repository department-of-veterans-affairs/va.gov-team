# Product Release Guide 
How do we ensure a smooth and successful launch?

## Steps can be taken prior to release to ensure a smoothe and successful launch.
In the "Build" phase of the VSP cycle, prior to the Staging review:

It is beneficial to conduct internal QA. This consisf of the team allocating 1 hour to meet and have the team look for bugs and or issues with the product. This is beneficial because the engineers and designers have in-depth knowledge of potential problem areas that QA might not have the time/resources to look into.
