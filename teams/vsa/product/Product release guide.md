# Feedback from other teams

**QA feedback:**
- Staging review scheduling: Have artifacts in and tag Tze 2 weeks in advance from the Staging Review. This makes it possible for Tze to get to it w/o being rushed.
- When you schedule the Staging review, also tag Tze in Slack.

**Platform feedback:**
- The biggest blocker to a successful launch would be not implementing platform feedback earlier in the process. 
- It would be ideal to implement the feedback prior to the staging review. 
- More frequent communication of changes/issues via the slack channel would be beneficial.

**Accessibility feedback:**
- Include accessibility in design syncs, design-intent review, and anytime large changes are made.
- More frequent communication with Accessibility (ex: Biweekly accessibility meetings)
- For individual meeting/mini reviews use this [GH template](Enter link to template)
- Have an "Engineering intent review" and include accessibility (in addition to design intent review).

**PM Feedback:**
- Update Collaboration Tracker
- Add time estimates maybe
- how to roll this out
- put in epic format?
