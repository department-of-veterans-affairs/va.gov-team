### Appendix
#### Situation
VSA teams work on products that help Veterans discover, apply for, track, and manage their benefits. \
These are forms, content, and search-driven products. As a result, how teams measure success differs across product types. \
We know the ability to make product decisions using qualitative and quantitative data is a core competency for PMs and product teams.\
These decisions are the results of insights drawn from user patterns, pain points, and opportunities.\
Achieving measurable outcomes for Veterans and others is the result of acting upon informed product decisions. 


#### Methodology
The VSA Product Practice conducted an internal workshop series. The goal of this workshop was to discover ways to improve our ability to leverage quantitative data to generate quantitative insights. 
Over the course of multiple 45 min sessions, we: 
1. Agreed on the problem statement
1. Defined pain points
1. Discussed and prioritized How Might We statements
1. Sketched and shared our solution ideas
1. Generated and discussed solution assumptions
1. Prioritized solution ideas
