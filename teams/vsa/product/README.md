### Setting Direction-Guideposts, OKRs, and Bets
Each VSA product team defines their guideposts; the mission, vision, and north star of their impact on Veterans.
They establish quarterly Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) that advance them towards their vision. 
Teams develop bets, or hypotheses, they believe will help them achieve their OKRs.

- Additional information about [Guideposts, OKRs, and bets.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16dnI4KwDTn7paw1MN4r0OvGtZPVneAN2fnQRVP9RPPs/edit#slide=id.p1)

### Roadmap

<details>
Each VSA product team publishes a "roadmap" of their OKRs and bets. Roadmaps help the cross-functional product team and stakeholders gain a better sense of the outcomes a given team targets. 
It doesn’t include the typical timeline of assumed features. Rather, it’s a hierarchical and time-bound view of the bets the team makes tracing back to strategic goals.

### Product Outline
Product Outlines serve as the top-level description of the product a team owns. It's primary focus is on a product's metadata (e.g. contact info) and steady-state indicators of success for the given product.

### Initiatie Briefs
Initiative Briefs serve as a description of the project a team is pursuing to achieve a particular outcome. It's primary focus is around discovery, ensuring assumpitons re: a given hypothesis are sufficiently evaluated.

### Problem Brief
Problem Briefs serve as low-barrier starting point for teams to begin tackling a given issue. These problems are typically process-related or decision-related (vs. product-related that may be better suited by a Product Outline or Initiative Brief).

### MVPs

<details>
MVP is an often overused/convoluted term. And, there can be many definitions of an MVP. It may be referred to as the solution that *just* solves a problem or it may be referred to as the first version of a product. Without getting caught up in labels, an MVP has two primary characteristics: lessons are generated and future iterations are anticipated though not expected.

It's up to the product team to determine what makes up their MVPs. The PO, the PM, and the cross-functional team determine their MVP after they've defined the problem and before they've started to build. It contains:
- questions/problems they'd like to answer/solve
- features that might address those questions/problems
- a target date for launching the feature set that answers those queestions

At the end of the day, an MVP is a tool. Along with generating lessons that may be taken into subsequent iterations, it helps rally the team around a common goal.

### Sprint Objectives

<details>
  Each sprint begans with objectives. These objectives tailor a team's sprint commitments towards OKRs/bets they've set. VSA teams work with their VA counterparts to create these objectives and track progress against them throughout the sprint.

### Impact Review

  Every initiative—a new feature, a product launch, technical improvements—wraps up with a) a look-back at the results of our hypotheses and b) recommendations for how we might proceed moving forward.
