## Situation

The VA is scaling the digital services it provides through VA.gov. New experiences are prioritized and existing experiences are improved. 
DEPO, the VA’s product office, prioritizes initiatives that support VA.gov’s role as the VA’s digital front door. These initiatives help Veterans and others to find, apply, track, and manage VA benefits. 
Products are built and improved in part through VSA product teams. These product teams span four product suites: Unauthenticated Experience, Authenticated Experience, Health Products, Benefits & Memorials Products. 

## Complication 

We don't share the impact of the things we work on as often as we should. 
If we do, it's localized to a few people or a given team. 
That means we may not take advantage of quantitiative results to drive future prioritization. 
And we it means we may not celebrate the impact we have on Veterans beyond the launch of particular feature.

Q: How do we intentionally reflect on the measurable impact of our work? How do we use these lessons to inform our path forward?

## First Fridays - Initiative Impact Review: 

Every initiative—a new feature, a product launch, technical improvements—wraps up with a) a look-back at the results of our hypotheses and b) recommendations for how we might proceed moving forward.
