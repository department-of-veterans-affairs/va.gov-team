# Claims Form Upload Initiative Brief 
#### Overview

<details>
    Representatives need a way to submit forms for their claimants. We had a way for veterans to submit forms using Simple forms. We forked Simple Forms code as a starting point. Lifting and shifting the code saved us a lot of time. In the early design phases, it became clear that forking the code rather than reusing it in-place was the better option:
        - We needed to make it an ARP app which required some changes to make it function
        - We need to do additional checks on the backend for POA
        - We will eventually need to add multi-form upload for documents that require supporting evidence
        - We wanted to make the process easier for reps by making the digital form all one page

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
> ðŸ’¡ *VA.gov products measure success against Ease of use, Service Completion, Trust/Satisfaction, Health.*<sup>1</sup>\
> ðŸ’¡ *Identify balancing metrics to ensure you're not bringing about undesired outcomes.*

- Number of forms submitted
- Number of representatives using platform
- Uptime of platform

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks. Inspired by [SVPG's Four Big Risks](https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/).*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - Will reps log into ARP to use it
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - none. Simple forms proved the need

### What're you building
> A digital form submission tool

#### Go-to-market 
> We are working with the Connecticut VA to test our product first and have also received feedback from other groups
