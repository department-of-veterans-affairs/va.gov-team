# Learn how to ask for help
**Disability is complex.** No one will have all the answers, not even your specialists!

That's why it's important for us to _just ask_, and why we form communities of practice, not cathedrals of expertise.

The following will help you learn a little bit more about the complexity of disabilities, and hopefully encourage you that it's totally ok to ask questions.

## Pick 2 of the following to read or watch 🤓

### Read
- [ ] [Read chapter 2 of Sheri Byrne-Haber's book, Giving a Damn About Accessibility ](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6071fa745947937fc933ecbb/t/60a02725893d22758a6207c5/1621108519636/Giving-a-damn-about-accessibility.pdf)(page 26-34)

## Share your thoughts and questions 💡

_Only_ if you're comfortable, on the `#accessibility-champs` channel...
- [ ] Share one thing you learned from the materials above
- [ ] Ask one question (this can be about anything related to disability or accessibility)

If you're not comfortable, that's totally ok! You can also:
- Share your thoughts and questions with someone you trust in a private message or in person conversation
- Reflect on what you learned alone or [send a question directly to any of our specialists](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/a11y-champs/champions.md#specialists)! We're sworn to non-judgement and secrecy 🖖

## Take a break! Or continue on?
Phew. Deep breath. Feel free to take a break, we’re not going anywhere. You can also continue on if you’d like, the choice is 100% yours.
A couple of reminders before moving on to the next part of level 1:

If you have feedback from the technical (broken links) to the educational (hard to follow curriculum) or just want to say something nice, we'd love to hear it.
- [ ] <strong>Share your questions and thoughts in the `#accessibility-champs` channel.</strong> Did you learn something new today? Have a follow up question to this lesson? Let us know in the `#accessibility-champs` channel!
