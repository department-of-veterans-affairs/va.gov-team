# Try out a screen reader 🗣️

Finally, let's get you started on one screen reader ❇️
- If you use a Macbook, [watch this video on VoiceOver (youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R-6WvAihms&list=PLNYkxOF6rcICWx0C9LVWWVqvHlYJyqw7g&index=7)
- If you use a Windows computer, [watch this video on NVDA (youtube) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jao3s_CwdRU&list=PLNYkxOF6rcICWx0C9LVWWVqvHlYJyqw7g&index=9)

## Tasks to complete
- [ ] Turn on your screen reader of choice
  - [ ] If you're using VoiceOver, open up Safari
  - [ ] If you're using NVDA, open up Google Chrome
- [ ] [Go to VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/) 
- [ ] Attempt to navigate...
  - [ ] Line by line
  - [ ] Using headings

## Troubleshooting

If you're using a **Macbook** and don't hear things like `heading` and `list item`, you may need to change your Verbosity setting to "high." To do this, go to:
 - System Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver
 - Click "Open VoiceOver Utility"
 - Click "Verbosity"
 - Select "High" from the "Default Speech Verbosity" dropdown list,
 - Close VoiceOver Utility


## If you get stuck or have no idea what to do

Good! This is supposed to be difficult, and why we have a community 👐
- If you feel a little brave, ask for help on the `#accessibility-help` channel
- If you want a safer space, ask for help on our `#accessibility-champs` channel
