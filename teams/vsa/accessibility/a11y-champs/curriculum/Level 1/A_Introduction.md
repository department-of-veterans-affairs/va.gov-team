## Accessibility, compliance, and experience
**The word accessibility has many different meanings.** 

Depending on where you've heard it, it might mean...
- a baseline measure of being able to access and contribute to technology 
- a legal government requirement, like Section 508 compliance
- the qualities that make an experience open to all

**To make things simple (for now), let's think about accessibility in terms of compliance vs. experience**

### Compliance encompasses...
- what we think of when we hear "Section 508" or "WCAG 2.0" (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)
- meeting specific, measurable characteristics in order to pass legal requirements
- the measurements of a ramp that signify it can be accessed by disabled people
- assessed by a product team or an accessibility specialist

### Experience encompasses...
- the usefulness and understandability of a technology (usability)
- the totality of the effect or effects felt (experienced) internally by a user when interacting with a system, device, or product 
- the awful experience a disabled person may feel when being separated from their friends to access a compliant ramp behind a building and by the dumpsters
- assessed (and felt _internally_) by our disabled Veterans, family members, and caregivers

### We want to focus on disabled Veteran's experiences more (and compliance less)
Although it's easier for us to measure accessibility from the frame of compliance, it's not a guarantee that disabled Veterans will still use our products and services. Measuring and understanding the _experience_ of a product can be difficult, but it's much easier when:
- we understand we cannot assess the experience of disabled Veterans for them (we're not experts)
- we center their voices in our work as early and often as possible
- we learn how to ask one another for help

In doing so, we can design products and services that don't need to be remediated or require accommodations at all.

## Take a break! Or continue on?
Phew. Deep breath. Feel free to take a break, we’re not going anywhere. You can also continue on if you’d like, the choice is 100% yours.
A couple of reminders before moving on to the next part of level 1:
- [ ] <strong>[Complete this feedback survey (Microsoft Forms)](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAANAAToLe2lUM0FTUlRTRUxIMEhTVjc1RExON1JTVTk2Vi4u).</strong> This curriculum is a work in progress. If you have feedback from the technical (broken links) to the educational (hard to follow curriculum) or just want to say something nice, we'd love to hear it.
- [ ] <strong>Share your questions and thoughts in the `#accessibility-champs` channel.</strong> Did you learn something new today? Have a follow up question to this lesson? Let us know in the `#accessibility-champs` channel! 
- [ ] Move on to part 2 of level 1, or bookmark it for safekeeping.
