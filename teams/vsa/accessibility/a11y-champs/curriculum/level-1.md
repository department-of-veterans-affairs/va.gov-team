## Accessibility, compliance, and experience
**The word accessibility has many different meanings.** 

Depending on where you've heard it, it might mean...
- a baseline measure of being able to access and contribute to technology 
- a legal government requirement, like Section 508 compliance
- the qualities that make an experience open to all

**To make things simple (for now), let's think about accessibility in terms of compliance vs. experience**

### Compliance encompasses...
- what we think of when we hear "Section 508" or "WCAG 2.0" (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)
- "normative," meaning there are specific, measurable requirements in order to claim "conformance"
- the measurements of a ramp that signify it can be accessed by disabled people
- assessed by a product team or an accessibility specialist

### Experience encompasses...
- the usefulness and understandability of a technology (usability)
- the totality of the effect or effects felt (experienced) internally by a user when interacting with a system, device, or product 
- the awful experience a disabled person may feel when being separated from their friends to access a compliant ramp behind a building and by the dumpsters
- assessed (and felt _internally_) by our disabled Veterans, family members, and caregivers

### We want to focus on disabled Veteran's experiences more (and compliance less)
Although it's easier for us to measure accessibility from the frame of compliance, it's not a guarantee that disabled Veterans will still use our products and services. Measuring and understanding the _experience_ of a product can be difficult, but it's much easier when:
- we understand we cannot assess the experience of disabled Veterans for them (we're not experts)
- we center their voices in our work as early and often as possible
- we learn how to ask one another for help

In doing so, we can design products and services that don't need to be remediated or require accommodations at all.

## Learn how to ask for help
**Disability is complex.** No one will have all the answers, not even your specialists!

That's why it's important for us to _just ask_, and why we form communities of practice, not cathedrals of expertise.

The following will help you learn a little bit more about the complexity of disabilities, and hopefully encourage you that it's totally ok to ask questions.

### Pick 2 of the following to read or watch 🤓

#### Read
