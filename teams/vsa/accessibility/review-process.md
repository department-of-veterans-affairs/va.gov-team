## Design Review

There are two checkpoints
1. **Design Intent Checkpoint** — *Integrated with VSP design check-ins:* [Schedule a design intent review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=emilywaggoner%2C+CrystabelReiter%2Cjenstrickland&labels=508%2FAccessibility%2C+design+review%2C+product+support&template=request_design_review_vsa.md&title=Request+design+review+for+ENTER_PRODUCT_NAME)

    a. For VSA projects, involve the VSA accessibility specialist in early discussions about needs, priorities, concepts, research planning, and direction to ensure potential accessibility concerns are nipped in the bud. This could look like an initial kickoff with all team members, plus shared resources, in attendance, or if it is for a smaller component scheduling a call to review the work together. 

    b. Include the VSA accessibility specialist in standups and reviews to ensure inclusive design is woven through the efforts.

    c. Review initial design sketches, mockups, and research plans with the accessibility specialist for inclusion and accessibility considerations.

    d. Please consider the accessibility specialist as a collaborative partner as work continues. 

    e. For guidance during design, [Future State] review WCAG 2.1 Checklist (similar: https://www.jenstrickland.design/talks/design4performance-a11y/resources/WCAG_Checklist.pdf)

2. **Design Review Checkpoint** — *Integrated with VSP* — [Schedule a design review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=emilywaggoner%2C+CrystabelReiter%2Cjenstrickland&labels=508%2FAccessibility%2C+design+review%2C+product+support&template=request_design_review_vsa.md&title=Request+design+review+for+ENTER_PRODUCT_NAME)

    Accessibility design review considerations:

    a. Mobile design
    
    b. Laptop/desktop design
        
    c. Semantic heading order

    d. Spacing of interactive items
        
    e. Cognitive impact
        
    f. Plain language
        
    g. Consistency & best practices
        
    h. Mobile-only interactions
        
    i. Touch interactions
        
    j. Performance budget consideration
  
    Team will coordinate another design review after designs are updated by @-comment in Zenhub in the Github issue.
  
    Once all issues are addressed, the ticket is closed with a final comment, “All issues are addressed”, @-comment designer who opened issue, and close ticket/issue.

## Development Review

There are two checkpoints:

1. **Design-Development Intent Checkpoint** — [Schedule a design-dev intent review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/request_dev_review_vsa.md) - This would happen as the design is passed to development, before beginning development.

    a. Review design with the VSP/VSA to discuss approach to take with development

    b. Identify what components and semantic HTML would be appropriate

    c. Identify any accessibility issues and how to address

    d. During engineering, here are some available resources:
  
        i. [Future State]  Review WCAG 2.1 Checklist (similar: [https://www.jenstrickland.design/talks/design4performance-a11y/resources/WCAG_Checklist.pdf](https://www.jenstrickland.design/talks/design4performance-a11y/resources/WCAG_Checklist.pdf)
  
        ii. Review and follow the development relevant steps in the [Accessibility Best Practices](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/508-accessibility-best-practices.md)
  
        iii. Developers may request a casual accessibility audit, akin to the design intent review
  
        iv. [Sample of early review, issues noted in Github](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/2553)
  
        v. [VSA Audit Ticket Template (draft)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O6r5WSjpI2jDvgPkNNCCFmUYS8PJpUqf6nP55tEKISo/edit?ts=5db8af69#)
    
2. **Pre-launch 508 Review Checkpoint** - This would happen well before launch, to allow the 508 office time to review, and then address any issues uncovered.

    a. Review and follow the steps in the [508 Checklist](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/508-checklist.md)
    
    b. If you'd like, you may request an spot check accessibility review ahead of the Pre-launch 508 Review: [Schedule an accessibility review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/request_dev_review_vsa.md)

    b. If your project is code stable in Staging, [request a Pre-launch 508 Review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/508-request-prelaunch-review.md)

    c. Accessibility specialist review will check the following:
  
        i. axe browser scan
        
        ii. Lighthouse scan
        
        iii. JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver read-through
        
        iv. Keyboard navigation
        
        v. Color contrast & blindness
        
        vi. In-app Browser Check
        
        vii. Zoom to 400% at 1280px

    d. During review, issues will be noted by the accessibility specialist:
  
        i. Accessibility specialist will create an epic in Zenhub to capture issues.
  
        ii. [Sample of backlog](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsp-5cedc9cce6e3335dc5a49fc4/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/2670)
  
        iii. [Sample of epic](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsp-5cedc9cce6e3335dc5a49fc4/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/2843)
  
        iv. Team will coordinate another review after work is updated by @-comment in Zenhub in the Github issue.

        v. Once all issues are addressed, the ticket is closed with a final comment, “All issues are addressed”, @-comment developer who opened issue, and close ticket/issue.
