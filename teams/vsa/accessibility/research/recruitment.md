## 5 Participants Are Not Enough
For most VA services, we recommend not referencing the Nielsen Norman article [“Why you only need to test with 5 users”](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/) as a reason to test with only 5 users before launch. 

### 1. The NN group article recommends multiple, lean studies.
One study with only 5 participants that introduces new design changes will not be able to validate the future performance of those changes. 

> “After creating the new design, you need to test again… there is no guarantee that the new design does in fact fix the problems. A second test will discover whether the fixes worked or whether they didn’t. The ultimate user experience is improved much more by 3 studies with 5 users each than by a single monster study with 15 users.” - NN Group

### 2. Veterans are not a homogenous set of users. 
[According to the Voices of the Veteran study, Veterans are a highly diverse group with many unique needs](https://digital.gov/2016/09/29/voices-of-veterans-introducing-personas-to-better-understand-our-customers/). We shouldn't limit the scope of our services to a specific group of people amongst Veterans.

> “You need to test additional users when a website has several highly distinct groups of users. The formula only holds for comparable users who will be using the site in fairly similar ways.” - NN Group

### 3. The NN group article is outdated and does not discuss device or user diversity in detail. 
The article was written on March 18, 2000. That’s two decades before testing on multiple devices, AT, and for inclusion was the norm. An update was released on June 03, 2021, but it is still a decade old. For context, the concept of responsive web design was introduced in 2010 by Ethan Marcotte. We now know that behavior on mobile and desktop can significantly vary, so findings for one cannot be universally applicable for the other.

> “If, however, you are simply attempting to expose as many usability problems as possible in the shortest amount of time, then **test at least four to five participants of each user or audience cell**.” - Handbook of Usability Testing

## How many participants should I recruit then?
How many users you recruit depends on a number of different factors including, but not limited to:

- The degree of confidence in the results that you require
- The number of available resources to set up and conduct the test
- The availability of the type of participants you require
- The duration of the test session

That being said, **a good rule of thumb is to recruit 4-6 participants users per user group**, or until the point you stop hearing new responses (**saturation**). For example, since novice screen reader users are a separate group from advanced screen reader users, a researcher should aim to recruit 4 of each in an assistive tech study.

## Maximum Variation Sampling
Purposefully selecting a wide range of social identity categories (like race or disability) among Veterans will help your findings better:
- Document diversity of needs and behavior
- Identify important common patterns that cut through the noise of variation on dimensions of interest

Should you use MVS, try to meet the following numbers (based on VA statistics) in your sample as a **minimum** (or collective sample groups from several lean research iterations):
- [50% aged 55-64+](https://www.va.gov/VETDATA/docs/SurveysAndStudies/VETPOP.pdf)
- [50% with an identified cognitive disability](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/working-papers/2016/demo/Holder-2016-01.pdf)
- [50% primarily mobile users](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125614/#:~:text=The%20rate%20of%20smartphone%20ownership,low%20levels%20of%20current%20engagement.)
- [30% people of color](https://www.va.gov/HEALTHEQUITY/Race_Ethnicity.asp)
- [25% in a rural area](https://www.ruralhealth.va.gov/aboutus/ruralvets.asp)(anecdotally [quoted at 45% by David Shulkin)](https://ldi.upenn.edu/news/david-shulkin-looks-back-his-tenure-veterans-affairs-secretary)
- [25% without a degree](https://www.luminafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/veterans-without-degrees.pdf)
- [17% with immigrant origins](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/immigrant-veterans-united-states-2018&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1625685989316000&usg=AOvVaw3BUzLAZ-kcn0HyefpbWihq)
- [10% women](https://www.womenshealth.va.gov/womenshealth/latestinformation/facts.asp#:~:text=Women%20Veterans%20Health%20Care,-Facts%20and%20Statistics&text=The%20current%20projected%20percentage%20of,years%20for%20their%20male%20counterparts.)

If feasible, we also recommend recruiting at least one participant from the following underserved communities:
- Native American Veterans, [who have the highest per-capita involvement of any population to serve in the U.S. military](https://www.nicoa.org/american-indian-veterans-have-highest-record-of-military-service/#:~:text=American%20Indians%20and%20Alaska%20Natives,conflict%20for%20over%20200%20years.&text=Nearly%2020%20percent%20of%20American,all%20other%20servicemembers%20were%20women).
- Veterans in the LGTBQ+ community, given recent direction from the VA secretary for a review of [VA policies to ensure that transgender Veterans and employees do not face discrimination](https://blogs.va.gov/VAntage/85152/secretary-orders-review-vas-transgender-policies/) on the basis of their gender identity and expression.
- Veterans with other than honorable discharge.
- Immigrant Veterans or Veterans from immigrant families.
- Veterans living abroad
- Non-english speakers

If time and budget allows, we recommend testing with Veterans who use the following AT. Ideally aim to recruit 4-6 of each group across iterative studies:
- Screen reader (mobile and desktop, beginner and advanced)
- Keyboard 
- Magnification 
- Hearing aids
- Voice recognition 
- (We are currently working on guidance for switch devices and braille readers)

If relevant to your study, your sample may also aim to include:
- Family members and caregivers
- Veteran service officers (VSOs)

To simplify planning for recruitment, [use our VA recruitment checker spreadsheet on Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to check if you're meeting the right amount of numbers for your study. Google sheets is not accessible within the VA network, so if you're looking to share findings, take a screenshot.

If your time and budget does not allow for including groups listed above, please reference the communicating and documenting risk section.

Should there be unique deviations within the findings based on particular characteristics, we recommend strategically confirming and disconfirming those cases within another iterative study.

## Lean MVS Strategy
In most cases, you will be unable to achieve maximum variation in just one study let alone recruit enough participants to begin with due to too many variables to consider during recruitment.

A lean MVS strategy involves setting up multiple cohorts that isolate key variables. This will make it easier to find participants while still maintaining a diversity of age, gender, education, location, and more. 

The MVS checker should be used to keep track of which underserved communities have been included in research across several cohorts; and to help determine what variables future cohorts should have.

### Use lean MVS strategy when you’re:
- Unable to recruit a high volume of participants. 
- Experiencing a large volume of no shows.
- Looking to iterate on findings or need to validate new changes in a design throughout a study.

## Deviant Case Sampling
Deviant case sampling involves investigating cases that highlight notable outcomes, failures, or successes to unveil critical reasons for failure and future best practices.

### Use deviant case sampling when:
- Your product has a large amount of failed submissions or drop offs. Purposefully recruiting folks who have failed to use your product and comparing them against successful cases can help glean findings from the differences in behavior, environment, goals, and privilege between them.

<br aria-hidden="true"/>

## Critical Case Sampling
Critical case sampling is useful in exploratory qualitative research, research with limited resources, as well as research where a single case (or small number of cases) can be decisive in explaining the phenomenon of interest.

### Use critical case sampling when:
- You don’t have the resources to test with many participants. Recruiting a smaller number of Veterans who make up the most complex cases will likely cover less complex cases in your study. For example, testing with 1 low vision Veteran who uses browser magnification tools and a screen reader could cover the needs of older age groups, screen reader users, mobile users (reflow), and more.

## Key Informant Sampling
Key informant sampling involves recruiting SMEs or people with great knowledge and/or influence who can shed light on complicated or delicate issues. 

### Use key informant sampling when:
- Your product touches complex or delicate subjects like health, trauma, identity,  finance, or accessibility. Let experts review your research first before you conduct a study to avoid compromising the health and safety of our Veterans.
- You need more evidence or support for research findings. Having experts confirm or deny your hypothesis can help increase the credibility and validity of your findings (also known as practitioner triangulation).
- You don’t know where to start. Reaching out to an expert can accelerate your understanding of the product and its users.

### Pairing with Snowball Sampling
Snowball sampling is where recruited participants help recruit new participants for a study. Pairing this with key informant sampling, can be a great way of discovering and obtaining access to more experts.

Use snowball sampling when working with VSOs or VA employees. At the end of your study:
- Ask your key informant if there’s anyone else they know that they would recommend you to talk to.
- Ask if they can introduce you to them or if you can CC them on an email for credibility on contact.
- Be sure to thank them for their time.

> Case study: During PTSD discovery research, the benefits team was able to gather interviews with VSOs across the country using snowball sampling. This led to being introduced to a specialist on MST which gleaned key insights on the subject.
