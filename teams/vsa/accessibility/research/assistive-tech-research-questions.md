# Assistive Tech research FAQs - Interview with Trevor Pierce on April 1, 2021
Tressa Furner, VSA Authenticated Experience

### 1. How does testing with assistive tech work? Do we need a separate research plan?

Assistive tech research is the same as non-assitive tech research - you can use the same plan.  There may be some nuance in language in how you frame the task or question for users. 

[Example research plan and outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/master/Products/Identity/Login/Research/508_Usability_Study)

### 2. How do we recruit for assistive tech?

Recruiting for inclusive research guidelines can be seen [here.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/inclusive-research-recommendations.md#guidelines-for-inclusive-research-recruiting)

### 3. How many people do we need to test with?

Testing for about 5-8 people for assistive tech will work. (I'm not sure if this is just for MyVA or if this is universal)

### 4. Should we test mobile or on desktop for assistive tech?

Either one will work. Desktop is easier because users don't need anything besides their computer. Users typically are used to using one or the other, so it might change testing outcomes if a user is using the device that they aren't used to.

For mobile, users **must** attach their phone to a computer, so they have to have the right cord and hardware to do so. Right now we can use zoom with IOS… but we don’t know about Android. Josh or Trevor will have to figure it out before hand if we decide to do a mobile test.  

I will make a document around *how* to share screen in a assistive tech setting when the time comes.

### 5. If we plan a mobile test, but a user ends up testing using desktop - does that negate findings?

This is on a case-by-case basis. Is this someone doing the test on a desktop using mobile screens? Or someone who is doing the test on a desktop using desktop screens?

The most important part is that you document what happened and consider the risks.

### 6. Is there a range of abilities we need to test?

No. Screen readers are the main thing that we’ve recruited for, at this time we’re not adding any other assistive tech.  

### 7. Does a11y need to be on the call or is it something our team could run?

A11y can help with dry runs to make sure any tech hiccups are worked out before the test and then the team can run the whole test. 

### 8. Can we do it in staging? Or does this need to be tested in production?

If you are testing with **NO** real user information then it can be done in staging.

If you **ARE** testing with real user information, then it needs to be done in production. 

# Assistive Tech research FAQs - Interview with Angela Fowler on April 5, 2021

### About Angela
- life long total blindness
- uses JAWS and and voiceover on IOS
- is willing to help with dry runs

### About screenreaders

- Layout doesn’t matter to her at all, the only thing that is important is tab order, keyboard access and percievability by screenreader. 
- Screen readers cannot see an image, but can see the ‘alternate text’ - use the tag ‘ alt =‘ associated with an image or image link.  (Says graphic followed by text)
- Aria text is a message giving instructions. Form labels tell you what is required e.g. "first name", "year" whereas Aria text can tell you how to enter it "enter year as 2 digits" 
- aria messages are also used to retrofit for accessibility. We shouldn’t use as a replacement for HTML. 
- Maps don’t typically work well with JAWS, it's hard to gauge the level of zoom happening on the map without radius ("zoom to x miles" is better than "zoom to level 11"). 


### Who to test

There are different types of people who use screen readers:
  - No amounts of vision
  - Small amounts of vision
  - life-long total blindness
  - lost vision later in life

We need to differentiate between low vision vs no vision in research because that will effect how they are using the screen reader.

We need to differentiate between life-long total blindness vs lost vision later in life because that will effect the level of comfort with using a screenreader.

Mobile vs desktop: both should be tested because users are using both. VO on iPhone has existed for a dozen years.

#### Other participant considerations
- "See" is a term that is all encompassing for all senses
- Don't say "condition", better: "How long has this been the case?" to ask about level of vision

## Follow up questions

- Can we ask for a screenshare? What's the best way to ask for a screenshare? What if they don't use a monitor?
