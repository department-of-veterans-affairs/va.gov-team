# Communicating and Documenting Risk
Documenting risks in research:
- keeps us honest and transparent about our work
- provides guidance for future work (to mitigate the risks identified)
- prevents findings from being misinterpreted or misused

This is the next step should the earlier recommendations in this document be unattainable due to constraints in your study. 

**Documenting risks in your research will not be used in any way to judge your ability.** In fact, the hallmark of a reflexive and ethically in-tune researcher is being able to acknowledge the limitations of one’s research methods and identify where those limitations stemmed from. 

For example, what if your usability test showed that a navigational effort performed well, but you weren’t able to recruit Veterans who use assistive technology or mobile devices? You should note that your finding:
- is specific to desktop-centric Veterans who don’t use assistive technology
- does not account for the underserved Veteran groups captured in the VA recruitment checker 
- should have a follow up study that specifically targets to include them
- should only introduce changes that are thoughtfully considered to prevent the chance of unintentionally further marginalizing underserved Veterans

## Exclusion in Recruitment
The first step of inclusive design is recognizing exclusion. Follow the steps below to report out gaps in your sample and bring attention to underserved Veteran communities.

### 1. [Use the VA recruitment checker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to identify exclusion in your sample
Follow the steps below:
- Open the recruitment checker, duplicate the page, and rename the sheet with your study’s name and date.
- Enter the final number of participants, AT users, and no shows in row 2.
- Enter "1" in each underserved dimension (rows) the Veteran (column) identifies with. A Veteran may identify with more than one dimension.
- Enter “0” in each underserved dimension the Veteran does not identify with.
- If there’s a no show, replace the “1”s with “N’s.”
- If there are underserved dimensions that have no participants due to a lack of data from the initial survey, write "unknown" under target
- Write in any notes on no-shows or recommendations.
- Take a screenshot of the matrix and place it into your research readout.

> The 7th participant identified as over the age of 60 as a woman, so a “1” is placed within those respective rows. The 6th participant was a no-show, so their dimensions are marked with a “N.” The 5th participant did not identify with any of these dimensions, so the entire column is “0.” 

### 2. Add the participant checker into your research readout 
Take a screenshot of your participant checker and place it within your research readout. Write a list of the dimensions that did not meet the minimum to be representative. For example:

> #### Underserved groups in research 
> This research may not include the perspectives of the following underserved Veteran groups:
> - Group 1
> - Group 2
> - Etc
>

### 3. Copy the recruitment checker into your research findings presentation
Take a screenshot of the recruitment checker and add it to your research findings presentation using the [DEPO research readout template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13G80avWGdY7tHU40PbP_l05W1yRpDr-opOk0u_AAhzQ/edit?usp=sharing).

## Absence of Assistive Technology in Usability Testing
It will not be possible to include those who use AT if the research includes testing prototypes in tools such as InVision, UXPin, or Mural. If you’re unable to test with AT users, make sure to document that risk within your research readout and presentation:

> Findings of this study may not apply to Veterans who use assistive technology so we anticipate: 
> - the potential for more launch blocking 508 defects
> - a longer accessibility testing and remediation process
> - possible, unintended exclusion of Veterans with disabilities
> 
> To reduce the risk of excluding these Veterans, we recommend conducting usability tests with Veterans with assistive technology in staging or production within the next month or as soon as time and resources allow.
