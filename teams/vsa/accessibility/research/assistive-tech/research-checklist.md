# AT Research Checklist and Disability Etiquette

## Checklist to prepare for research:
- [ ] **Request an accessibility specialist** to help you write and review your research plan and conversation guide.
- [ ] **Plan for 2x the time** you’d usually need. **We recommend 2 hours for most studies**. There may be technical difficulties, the need for breaks, or unexpected situations during the study. Beginner AT users will also need more time to complete tasks. 
- [ ] **Request for both beginner and advanced AT users** during recruitment as their needs and behavior may be significantly different.  We recommend also asking for users with congenital (from birth) and acquired disabilities.
- [ ] **Give participants a choice** both before and during the session for the following topics:
    - Private (1-2 observers) vs. open (3+ observers) studies.
    - Video on vs. video off.
    - Recording vs. no recording.
    - How they prefer to receive links if you’re planning on sending links during the study. 
    - Closed captions (CC) on or off. If the user does not have a preference, turn them on by default unless the participant uses a screen reader.
- [ ] **Confirm the participant’s technology** ahead of the session. You’ll want to know:
    - What specific combination of AT and devices they are using. For example, “VoiceOver on desktop with magnification tools” or “TalkBack on Samsung Galaxy 8” is better than just “Screen Reader.”
    - If they have a screen (they may not be able to screen share if there is no screen to share).
- [ ] **Schedule a pilot test with an accessibility specialist** ahead of the study to practice with and gain familiarity with the anticipated AT.
- [ ] Watch the [DC government disability sensitivity training video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv1aDEFlXq8).

## Do during facilitation:
- [ ] **Mirror the participant's word choice on their disability**. If unsure, **default to people first language** in the United States. Avoid phrases like “physically challenged,” “differently abled,” or “people with impairments.” For example:
    - “People with disabilities” instead of “handicapped people.”
    - “People with a physical disability” instead of “physically challenged.”
    - “People with cognitive disabilities” instead of “cognitively impaired.”
- [ ] **Respect the participant's privacy.** Allow them to discuss their situation if and when they feel comfortable doing so. 
- [ ] **Allow participants to take breaks** whenever they need them or plan scheduled breaks in your study.

## Don't during facilitation:
- [ ] **Don’t focus on the participant's disability.** Treat them like any other participant. For example, instead of asking “How does blindness affect how you complete this benefits form?” consider “How would you complete this benefits form?”
- [ ] **Don’t praise them for the heroism of their disability.** [Don't treat people with disabilities as objects of inspiration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K9Gg164Bsw) (Stella Young, TED).
- [ ] **Don’t make assumptions.** People with disabilities are the best judge of what they can or cannot do. For example, if your product uses a camera, don’t assume that a Veteran who is blind wouldn’t want to or be able to use it.
- [ ] **Don’t use disempowering words** like “victim” or “sufferer.”
- [ ] **Don’t interrupt the participant.** Listen patiently and, if needed, ask for clarification
- [ ] **Don’t assume the participant needs help.** Don't take action without asking. If you’re unsure of what to do, ask them if they need any assistance first.
- [ ] **Don’t time tasks** (unless it’s for a specific advanced-user study). AT users may have large deviations in task completion time depending on their technology and experience.
