# A plain English introduction to inclusive research

## Before we start, some definitions üìò
We want this introduction to be easy for you (and anyone else) to pick up and read! We‚Äôll start with some brief definitions and examples around inclusive research.

> ‚ÄúBecause inclusive language is continually evolving, ours should be too. I‚Äôm certain that the language we use now, and that I‚Äôve used in this book will have moved on one, five, or ten years from now.‚Äù - Kelly Ann McKercher, *Beyond Sticky Notes*

### Underserved (or underrepresented) communities
Groups of people who share a particular characteristic who have been left out of something important in society. All Veterans, their caretakers, and their family members are underserved in American society[^1] , but some are more underserved than others.
When we talk about ***underserved communities ***within the context of our research, we‚Äôre talking about groups of people who:
* Are underserved in American society for reasons other than being a Veteran, caretaker, or family member of a Veteran
 * For example, some disabled Veterans may struggle to navigate state government unemployment websites, of which [86% fail at least one basic test for mobile page load speed, mobile friendliness, or accessibility](https://itif.org/publications/2020/04/15/most-state-unemployment-websites-fail-mobile-and-accessibility-tests).
* Were underserved historically by Veterans Affairs
 * For example, in the summer of 1947, [only two of the 3,299 VA-guaranteed home loans in 13 Mississippi cities went to Black borrowers](https://time.com/6126195/black-veterans-gi-bill-world-war-two/) despite Blacks accounting for half the population of the state.
* May not participate in or have access to research studies at Veterans Affairs
 * Over the course of [7 studies in 2021-2022](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) that recorded the racial identity of participants, *none* of those participants identified as Hispanic, Latina, or Latinx[^2] 
For a more detailed description of underserved communities (but in less plain language), consider reading the [Executive Order on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce (Whitehouse.gov)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/25/executive-order-on-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-workforce/).

Examples of the above include, but are not limited to:
* Older Veterans above the age of 55
* Veterans with an identified cognitive disability
* Veterans who primarily use mobile devices
* Veterans of color (specifically Black, Native, and Hispanic/Latina/Latinx Veterans)
* Veterans who live in rural areas
* Veterans without a college degree or professional certificate[^3] 
* Veterans who are first-generation immigrants or the children of immigrants (immigrant origin)
* Women Veterans
* LGTBQ+ Veterans
* Veterans living abroad
* Veterans whose primary language is not English
* Disabled Veterans who use assistive technology
* Family members
* Caregivers

### Equality
Equality is when people are given the *same* resources or opportunities.
When we talk about ***equality*** when recruiting users, we‚Äôre talking about Veterans, their family members, and their caretakers all having equal opportunities to participate in our research.
For example, if 77% of Veterans are white and 15% of Veterans are Black, a research study that aims for equality should be made up of around 77% white Veterans and 15% Black Veterans.
An example of ***inequality*** would be if Spanish-speaking Veterans struggle to sign up for our studies because it‚Äôs not offered in their primary language.

### Equity
Equity is when we recognize that people come from different circumstances and allocate the exact resources and opportunities needed to reach an equal outcome.
When we talk about ***equity*** in recruitment, we‚Äôre talking about giving underserved communities of Veterans *more* opportunities to participate in our research.
For example, a sample of [past research studies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) suggests that we‚Äôve failed to recruit:
* Hispanic, Latina, and Latinx Veterans despite them making up [8% of the Veteran population (estimated to rise to 12% in 2045)](https://www.va.gov/HEALTHEQUITY/Race_Ethnicity.asp)
* Asian Veterans (around 2% of the Veteran population)
* Native Veterans who have the [highest per-capita involvement of any population to serve in the U.S. military](https://www.nicoa.org/american-indian-veterans-have-highest-record-of-military-service/#:~:text=American%20Indians%20and%20Alaska%20Natives,conflict%20for%20over%20200%20years.&text=Nearly%2020%20percent%20of%20American,all%20other%20servicemembers%20were%20women)

If we want to make up for years of research potentially biased towards the needs of a majority white Veteran population, we need to make a conscious effort to recruit more Veterans of color.

### Inclusive research
Research that aims to include underserved communities so that they can play an active role in decisions that affect their own lives.
For us, that means creating a future where underserved Veteran communities (including caretakers and family members) can fully take part in our research.

---

## Why does inclusive research matter?
We want to empower underserved communities of Veterans to be able to fully represent themselves in our research. By doing so, we can:

### Design services that *all* Veterans can easily access and use.
By including communities of Veterans with more complex and underrepresented needs first we can:
* Design services that Veterans with the most complex needs (for example, Veterans who use technology for their disabilities) can easily access and use
* Better cover the needs of everyone else
 * Designing for complex needs first like aging Veterans above the age of 55 or Veterans with disabilities means designing for the future of *all *Veterans who age or acquire disabilities later in life

### Increase the accuracy and impact of our research findings.
If our research doesn‚Äôt provide equal (or ideally equitable) opportunities to participate for certain underserved communities of Veterans, how can we be confident that our services will be useful to them at all?
For example, check out this research study conducted by the facilities team which uncovered a number of new insights that [Veterans using assistive technology struggled to use the facility locator](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/research/user-research/screenreader-usability-study/research-findings.md#using-facility-locator-and-assistive-technology) despite [success with Veterans without assistive technology in prior studies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/research).

### Create more awareness around underserved Veteran communities.
The more we openly talk about underserved communities of Veterans, point out gaps in our recruitment, and look for ways to improve‚Äì the faster we‚Äôll be able to reach equity.

---

## How can you get started?

### 1. Join our community at **#inclusive-research**
Let‚Äôs be honest. Inclusive research is hard and we‚Äôre going to need a diverse community to continue taking steps in the right direction. It‚Äôs 100% ok to be lost and confused. If you have a question, ask it in our slack channel! We‚Äôll work together to find better answers with absolutely no judgment in the process.

### 2. Shoot for the equity stars even if you end up landing up in an equality tree
When starting your recruitment process, think about which underserved groups of Veterans may be the most critical in your research.

This will likely vary project to project depending on what you‚Äôre working on, but it‚Äôs always a safe bet to aim for an equitable sample that is:
* 100% Veterans with an identified cognitive disability (*anyone* can acquire a cognitive disability)
* More than 50% age 55 or older
* More than 50% Veterans of color (specifically Black, Hispanic/Latina/Latinx, and Native)
* More than 50% primarily mobile or tablet device users
* More than 50% identify as other than male (for example: women, transgender, nonbinary, two-spirit)
* More than 50% in a rural area
* More than 50% without a degree or professional certificate

For any research that introduces new design patterns, involves a form, or requires a good amount of interaction that goes beyond reading content, it‚Äôs also a safe bet to plan a study specific for disabled Veterans who use technology to help access the internet (assistive technology) including, but not limited to:
* Desktop screen reader like JAWS or NVDA
* Mobile screen reader like VoiceOver or TalkBack
* Magnification or Zoom tools like ZoomText or Fusion
* Voice input technology like Siri or Dragon Naturally Speaking
* Hearing aids
* Keyboard (meaning they are sighted, and don‚Äôt use a mouse)
* Captions
* Switch devices
* Braille readers

We encourage you to add on any other characteristics that may be relevant to the service you‚Äôre working on. For example, if you‚Äôre doing research around caretakers and family members, you may want to consider including caretakers and family members who don‚Äôt speak English as their first language.
If you‚Äôre not sure who else you should be including in your research, what goals you should be aiming for, or anything else‚Äì ask about it in our #inclusive-research channel.

### 3. And if you can‚Äôt land in an equality tree, talk about it!
If you can‚Äôt hit goals for equity or even equality, that‚Äôs 100% OK. It‚Äôs going to take time and teamwork to get there, and the best way to make progress is to continue the conversation (we‚Äôll provide some actionable steps at the end).

If you‚Äôre unable to recruit the following (which will likely be in most cases)...
* 50% with an identified cognitive disability
* 50% aged 55 or older
* 50% primarily mobile users
* 30% people of color
  * 15% Black
  * 12% Hispanic/Latina/Latinx
  * 4% Biracial
  * 3 % Asian
  * At least one Native participant
* 25% in a rural area (anecdotally quoted at 45% by David Shulkin)
* 25% without a degree
* 17% with immigrant origins
* 10% women
* At least one participant of each that identifies as:
  * Gay, lesbian, or bisexual
  * Transgender
  * Nonbinary, gender fluid, gender queer, Two-Spirit (Indigenous only), or another gender other than male or female
* At least one participant of each that uses a:
  * Desktop Screen Reader
  * Mobile Screen Reader
  * Magnification/Zoom
  * Voice AT like Siri/Dragon Naturally Speaking
  * Hearing Aids
  * Sighted keyboard

‚Ä¶ask yourself and your team these questions as your first step:
* Which underserved communities were missing or underrepresented in our research?
  * Why were they missing or underrepresented?
  * Are we confident that the insights we uncovered from other groups will apply to them too?
    * If so, why? What makes us confident? Are we making assumptions or do we have trusted sources of information we can point to?
* How might we run another session with underserved communities that were missing from this study?
  * Should we conduct a separate study (for example, usability testing) that focuses specifically on recruiting these underserved communities?
  * If we can‚Äôt run another session, why not? What‚Äôs blocking us?
    * Can we share what‚Äôs blocking us with the #inclusive-research channel?
    * Can we plan future studies differently to be more inclusive (for example, planning your research strategy to include multiple, iterative studies with different participant groups)?
* How might we connect with the folks at #inclusive-research to:
  * Help answer the above questions? OR
  * Contribute any of our findings to #inclusive-research‚Äôs collective understanding, conversation, and guidance of inclusive research?

‚Ä¶then talk about it in your research presentation! It‚Äôs as easy as using our [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) which will help you:
* Spot gaps of underserved Veteran communities who may have been left out of your research
* Present those gaps in your readout and presentation
* Start thinking about how to include those underserved Veterans in your next study
* Spark more conversation on how we can get better at recruiting those underserved Veteran communities

## Future goals for inclusive research (not in plain language)

### Equitable recruitment of underserved Veteran communities.
1. Set targets for recruiting underserved Veteran communities based on existing and projected VA statistics. Start piloting methods to track recruitment diversity.
2. **Now:** Begin actively tracking how many Veterans from underserved communities are participating in our studies each quarter across all VSA teams.
 1. Consider automating this through the existing recruitment tracker spreadsheet
3. **Later:** Analyze where we are sourcing Veterans from and explore new ways of widening recruitment to be more representative of the Veteran population.

### Documentation, materials, and methods are inclusive and accessible to all underserved Veteran communities.
1. **Now:** Reach out to and consult with medically trained professionals and organizations that focus on underserved Veteran communities. Ensure all recruitment documents and materials such as surveys and consent forms are Section 508 compliant and inclusively written.
2. **Next:** Test new inclusive research methods and retire inaccessible ones.
3. **Later:** Find metrics to evaluate our materials and methods with Veterans from underserved communities.

### Team members understand, value, and actively push forward inclusive research efforts.
1. Encourage researchers and designers to attend Angela‚Äôs office hours and to request accessibility specialist collaboration on research efforts.
2. Create an inclusive research community at the VA
3. **Now:** Create plain language resources and simple templates for inclusive research methods. Update onboarding to include inclusive research guidelines and training.
4. **Next:** Develop a more self-aware and transparent research culture on checking personal biases and communicating out risk.

### Current and future team members are equitably hired.
1. **Now:** Educate teams and internal stakeholders on the tangible value of diversity and inclusion of practitioners when it comes to inclusive product development. (Reference *Good Services* by Lou Downe, *Mismatch* by Kat Holmes, etc).
2. **Next:** Track diversity on research teams and mitigate the risk of a lack of practitioner triangulation by pairing researchers with embedded specialists.
3. **Later:** Create plans for inclusive hiring practices.

### Underserved Veteran Communities
Underserved communities are groups and communities that experience discrimination and exclusion (social, political and economic) because of unequal power relationships across economic, political, social and cultural dimensions.
