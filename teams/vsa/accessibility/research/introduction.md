# Introduction to Inclusive Research at VA
Inclusive research, in simple terms, is research that aims to include underserved communities (minorities, people with disabilities, etc) through methods that allow them to play an active and influential role in decisions which affect their own lives.

By stewarding inclusive research at the VA, we can:
- Design human centered products that all Veterans can easily use.
- Improve the validity of research findings by ensuring our participant samples are representative of the Veteran population.
- Uncover and remedy the exclusion of underserved Veteran communities who may have the greatest need for benefits.
- Create more awareness and conversation around underserved Veteran communities across all VA.gov teams.

## Setting inclusive goals 
We recommend setting the following inclusive goals in order to measure and track progress towards a more equitable VA experience.

### 1. Recruit, at a minimum, representative levels of underserved Veteran communities in research.
- Now: Set targets for recruiting underserved Veteran communities based on existing and projected VA statistics. Start piloting methods to track recruitment diversity. 
- Next: Track how many Veterans from underserved communities are participating in our studies each quarter across all VSA teams.
- Later: Analyze where we are sourcing Veterans from and explore new ways of widening recruitment to be more representative of the Veteran population.

### 2. Use accessible and inclusive research documentation, materials, and methods.
- Now: Reach out to and consult with medically trained professionals and organizations that focus on underserved Veteran communities. Ensure all recruitment documents and materials such as surveys and consent forms are Section 508 compliant and inclusively written.
- Next: Test new inclusive research methods and retire inaccessible ones.
- Later: Use the system usability scale to evaluate our materials and methods with Veterans from underserved communities.

### 3. Educate team members on the why and how of inclusive research and design.
- Now: Encourage researchers and designers to attend Angela’s office hours and to request accessibility specialist collaboration on research efforts. 
- Next: Write plain language resources for async reference and create simple templates for inclusive research methods. Update onboarding to include inclusive research guidelines and training.
- Later: Develop a more self-aware and transparent research culture on checking personal biases and communicating out risk.

### 4. Increase the diversity of employees and contractors at the VA.
- Now: Educate teams and internal stakeholders on the tangible value of diversity and inclusion of practitioners when it comes to inclusive product development. (Reference Good Services by Lou Downe, Mismatch by Kat Holmes, etc).
- Next: Track diversity on research teams and mitigate the risk of a lack of practitioner triangulation by pairing researchers with embedded specialists.
- Later: Create plans for inclusive hiring practices.

## Underserved Veteran Communities
Underserved communities are groups and communities that experience discrimination and exclusion (social, political and economic) because of unequal power relationships across economic, political, social and cultural dimensions.
