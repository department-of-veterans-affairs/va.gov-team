# A plain English introduction to inclusive research

## Before we start, some definitions üìò
We want this introduction to be easy for you (and anyone else) to pick up and read! We‚Äôll start with some brief definitions and examples around inclusive research.

> ‚ÄúBecause inclusive language is continually evolving, ours should be too. I‚Äôm certain that the language we use now, and that I‚Äôve used in this book will have moved on one, five, or ten years from now.‚Äù - Kelly Ann McKercher, *Beyond Sticky Notes*

### Underserved (or underrepresented) communities
Groups of people who share a particular characteristic who have been left out of something important in society. All Veterans, their caretakers, and their family members are underserved in American society[^1] , but some are more underserved than others.
When we talk about **underserved communities** within the context of our research, we‚Äôre talking about groups of people who:

* Are underserved in American society for reasons other than being a Veteran, caretaker, or family member of a Veteran
  * For example, [4 out of 10 state unemployment websites are considered "inaccessible,"](https://itif.org/publications/2020/04/15/most-state-unemployment-websites-fail-mobile-and-accessibility-tests/) suggesting that a meaningful portion of disabled Veterans most likely struggle or are unable to navigate their state government unemployment site.
* Were underserved historically by Veterans Affairs
  * For example, in the summer of 1947, [only two of the 3,299 VA-guaranteed home loans in 13 Mississippi cities went to Black borrowers](https://time.com/6126195/black-veterans-gi-bill-world-war-two/) despite Blacks accounting for half the population of the state.
* May not participate in or have access to research studies at Veterans Affairs
  * Over the course of [7 studies in 2021-2022](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) that recorded the racial identity of participants, *none* of those participants identified as Hispanic, Latina, or Latinx[^2] 
For a more detailed description of underserved communities (but in less plain language), consider reading the [Executive Order on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce (Whitehouse.gov)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/25/executive-order-on-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-workforce/).

Examples of underserved or underrepresented groups include, but are not limited to:
* Older Veterans above the age of 55
* Veterans with an identified cognitive disability
* Veterans who primarily use mobile devices
* Veterans of color (specifically Black, Native, and Hispanic/Latina/Latinx Veterans)
* Veterans who live in rural areas
* Veterans without a college degree or professional certificate[^3] 
* Veterans who are first-generation immigrants or the children of immigrants (immigrant origin)
* Women Veterans
* LGTBQ+ Veterans
* Veterans living abroad
* Veterans whose primary language is not English
* Disabled Veterans who use assistive technology
* Family members
* Caregivers

### Equality
Equality is when people are given the *same* resources or opportunities.
When we talk about ***equality*** when recruiting users, we‚Äôre talking about Veterans, their family members, and their caretakers all having equal opportunities to participate in our research.
For example, if 77% of Veterans are white and 15% of Veterans are Black, your research should be made up of around 77% white Veterans and 15% Black Veterans.
An example of ***inequality*** would be if Spanish-speaking Veterans struggle to sign up for our studies because it‚Äôs not offered in their primary language.

<br aria-hidden="true"/>
<img alt="Spanish speakers trying to sign up for a recruitment form... but getting dragged away after seeing it's only in English" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14154792/155893637-bc53817d-f9c3-4e3f-8763-028fe5a40b6e.png">

### Equity
Equity is when we recognize that people come from different circumstances and allocate the exact resources and opportunities needed to reach an equal outcome.
When we talk about ***equity*** in recruitment, we‚Äôre talking about giving underserved communities of Veterans *more* opportunities to participate in our research.
For example, a sample of [past research studies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) suggests that we‚Äôve done poorly at recruiting:
* Native Veterans, who have the [highest per-capita involvement of any population to serve in the U.S. military](https://www.nicoa.org/american-indian-veterans-have-highest-record-of-military-service/#:~:text=American%20Indians%20and%20Alaska%20Natives,conflict%20for%20over%20200%20years.&text=Nearly%2020%20percent%20of%20American,all%20other%20servicemembers%20were%20women)
* Veterans without degrees, who are [far more likely than non-veterans to hold non-degree credentials](https://www.luminafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/veterans-without-degrees.pdf), including certificates and certifications.
* LGBTQ+ Veterans, [who are are 5 times as likely to have PTSD](https://www.va.gov/HEALTHEQUITY/docs/LGBT_Veterans_Disparities_Fact_Sheet.pdf)

If we want to make up for years of research potentially biased towards the needs of a majority white and well-educated Veteran population, we need to make a conscious effort to recruit more Veterans from underserved communities.

<details>
 <summary>How do identities like race play into this? How does race or ethnicity factor into to understanding a Veteran's digital preferences or needs?</summary>
<p>While identities like race may not play into certain kinds of research we conduct (like the usability testing of a button), they may play an important role in others (like interviews about a Veteran's <a href="https://www.nber.org/digest/dec02/gi-bill-world-war-ii-and-education-black-americans">education</a> or <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-02-05/la-na-tuskegee-study-black-distrust-access-vaccine">trust towards health care benefits</a>). Our research is relational. As we all draw from the same participant database, who we request in our own individual studies can have an outwards impact into who Perigean continues to recruit-- and ultimately who we end up having access to. Being proactive about recruiting from underserved communities, even if dimensions like race may be irrelevant to your study, will make it easier for other researchers to recruit from those communities too instead of returning to dominant groups as the default.</p>
 <p>In addition, by not including participants with diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds, it is possible that unanticipated but important insights are being missed. It is impossible to predict these insights when not including diverse racial/ethnic voices, particularly if the product or UX team is White and, by virtue of their backgrounds and lived experiences, unable to anticipate important design or UX insights that would come from a participant of color. Privilege is blinding but research - and the empathy it produces - have the potential to identify and correct the difficulties of designing for a social group different from one's own.</p>

### Inclusive research
Research that aims to include underserved communities so that they can play an active role in decisions that affect their own lives.
For us, that means creating a future where underserved Veteran communities (including caretakers and family members) can fully take part in our research.

---

## Why does inclusive research matter?
Inclusive research helps us fight sampling bias, or the bias of recruiting Veterans from majority groups by default instead of underserved groups. More importantly, it helps us think about how we can center and prioritize underserved communities of Veterans in our research. By doing so, we can:

### Design services that *all* Veterans can easily access and use.
By including communities of Veterans with more complex and underrepresented needs first, we can:
* Design services that Veterans with the most complex needs (for example, Veterans who use technology for their disabilities) can easily access and use
* Better cover the needs of everyone else
 * Designing for complex needs first - like aging Veterans above the age of 55 or Veterans with disabilities - means designing for the future of *all *Veterans who age or acquire disabilities later in life

<img alt="A graph depicting Veterans with disabilities having a larger variety of needs and insights which covers the needs of aging Veterans and Veterans currently without disabilities." src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14154792/155893678-f48ea7fb-d288-4cdc-ad93-4619f5790f00.png"/>


### Increase the accuracy and impact of our research findings.
If our research doesn‚Äôt provide equal (or ideally equitable) opportunities to participate for certain underserved communities of Veterans, how can we be confident that our services will be useful to them at all?
For example, check out this research study conducted by the facilities team which uncovered a number of new insights that [Veterans using assistive technology struggled to use the facility locator](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/research/user-research/screenreader-usability-study/research-findings.md#using-facility-locator-and-assistive-technology) despite [success with Veterans without assistive technology in prior studies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/research).

### Create more awareness around underserved Veteran communities.
The more we openly talk about underserved communities of Veterans, point out gaps in our recruitment, and look for ways to improve‚Äì the faster we‚Äôll be able to reach equity.


---

## How can you get started?

### 1. Join our community at **#inclusive-research**
Let‚Äôs be honest. Inclusive research is hard and we‚Äôre going to need a diverse community to continue taking steps in the right direction. It‚Äôs 100% ok to be lost and confused. If you have a question, ask it in our slack channel! We‚Äôll work together to find better answers with absolutely no judgment in the process.

### 2. Aim to include 2+ underserved groups as primary criteria in your study
When starting your recruitment process, think about which underserved groups of Veterans may be the most critical or underreached in your research. 

* Who haven't you been able to recruit in the past? 
* Whose needs may be more critical or complex?

This will likely vary project to project depending on what you‚Äôre working on, but we recommend starting out by **selecting at least 1-2 of the following dimensions as primary criteria** for your research (meaning 100% of your participants identify as one of the following)...

* With an identified cognitive disability (*anyone* can acquire a cognitive disability)
* Age 55 or older 
* Of color (specifically Black, Hispanic/Latina/Latinx, and Native)
* Who are primarily mobile or tablet device users
* Who identify as other than male (for example: women, transgender, nonbinary, two-spirit)
* Who live in rural areas with a weaker internet connection
* Who don't have a degree or professional certificate

If you continue to **strategically and iteratively sample different combinations of underserved cohorts across different studies over time**, you may reach a more **equitable** sample across the board like this:

* Mostly (if not all) Veterans with an identified cognitive disability (*anyone* can acquire a cognitive disability)
* More than 50% age 55 or older
* More than 50% Veterans of color (specifically Black, Hispanic/Latina/Latinx, and Native)
* More than 50% primarily mobile or tablet device users
* More than 50% identify as other than male (for example: women, transgender, nonbinary, two-spirit)
* More than 50% in a rural area
* More than 50% who don't have a degree or professional certificate


We encourage you to add on any other characteristics that may be relevant to the service you‚Äôre working on. For example, if you‚Äôre doing research around caretakers and family members, you may want to consider including caretakers and family members who don‚Äôt speak English as their first language.
If you‚Äôre not sure who else you should be including in your research, what goals you should be aiming for, or anything else‚Äì ask about it in our #inclusive-research channel.

### 3. Focus on disabled Veterans _first_ when usability testing

For any research that introduces new design patterns, involves a form, or requires a good amount of interaction that goes beyond reading content, **we recommend starting with a study specific to Veterans who use screen readers or have severe cognitive disabilities**. 

While research with screen reader users and Veterans with cognitive disabilities may not be representative of disabilities as a whole, it's a great starting point to stress test your product for more complex cases. 

For more, 
- [read our platform guidance on research with disabled Veterans and assistive technology](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-with-assistive-technology-users)
- ask a question in our #accessibility-help channel or
- join Angela Fowler's accessibility office hours on Fridays

### 4. And if you can‚Äôt, that's ok! Talk about it!
If you can‚Äôt hit equitable recruitment goals or use the strategies above, that‚Äôs OK. It‚Äôs going to take time and teamwork to get there, and the best way to make progress is to continue the conversation (we‚Äôll provide some actionable steps at the end). If you notice you're not successfully recruiting from the groups above over time, ask yourself and your team these questions as your first step:

#### Which underserved communities were missing or underrepresented in our studies?
* Why were they missing or underrepresented?
* Are we confident that the insights we uncovered from other groups will apply to them too?
  * If so, why? What makes us confident? Are we making assumptions or do we have trusted sources of information we can point to?

#### How might we run another session with underserved communities that were missing from our studies so far?
* Should we conduct a separate study (for example, usability testing) that focuses specifically on recruiting these underserved communities?
* If we can‚Äôt run another session, why not? What‚Äôs blocking us?
  * Can we share what‚Äôs blocking us with the #inclusive-research channel?
  * Can we plan future studies differently to be more inclusive (for example, planning your research strategy to include multiple, iterative studies with different participant groups)?

#### How might we connect with the folks at #inclusive-research to:
* Help answer the above questions? OR
* Contribute any of our findings to #inclusive-research‚Äôs collective understanding, conversation, and guidance of inclusive research?

#### Talk about it in your research presentation! 
It‚Äôs as easy as using our [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) which will help you:

* Spot gaps of underserved Veteran communities who may have been left out of your research over time
* Present those gaps in your readout and presentation
* Start thinking about how to include those underserved Veterans in your next study
* Spark more conversation on how we can get better at recruiting those underserved Veteran communities

### Underserved Veteran Communities
Underserved communities are groups and communities that experience discrimination and exclusion (social, political and economic) because of unequal power relationships across economic, political, social and cultural dimensions.
