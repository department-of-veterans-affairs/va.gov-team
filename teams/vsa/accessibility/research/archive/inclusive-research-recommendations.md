# Inclusive Research Recommendations v1.0

With over 19 million Veterans as of 2020 [(1)](https://www.va.gov/vetdata/veteran_population.asp), there are many folks from a variety of backgrounds using VA.gov’s products. Having such a large user base gives us the opportunity to recruit a diverse range of participants to ensure accessibility and inclusivity are at the forefront of the tools we build.

## Why your team should practice inclusive recruiting

The following statistics emphasize how diverse our user population is, and why it’s important to mindfully recruit for research studies: 

- Approximately 40% of American Veterans have an identified disability [(2)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/250316/us-veterans-by-disability-status/)

- About 1.52 million (8.5 percent) Veterans had a service-connected disability rating of 70 percent or higher [(3)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/250316/us-veterans-by-disability-status/)

- An estimated 31 percent of troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have a mental health condition or reported experiencing a TBI [(4)](https://ncd.gov/publications/2009/March042009)

- 40% of Veterans live in rural areas (Shulkin, David J. *It Shouldn't Be This Hard to Serve Your Country: Our Broken Government and the Plight of Veterans*. New York: PublicAffairs, 2019.)

You can view this [Veterans disability statistics resource](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/veterans-disability-statistics.md) for additional statistics and personal stories of Veterans with disabilities. 

## Guidelines for inclusive research recruiting

There are some baseline characteristics to ensure minimum representation of Veteran participants in your research. These characteristics may need to be adjusted depending on the individual study (e.g. A study for a hearing aid battery re-ordering form may want to recruit at least one person with a cochlear implant). The numbers as well may need to be increased given the size of the study. We've provided these secondary recommendations for a study size of 8: 

- At least 4 smartphone users (at least 50% of Veterans are primarily smartphone users)

- At least 4 Veterans above the age of 60 (50% of Veterans are over the age of 60)

- At least 2 people with identified cognitive and/or learning disabilities. Examples of diagnoses that may align with this would be Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, and vertigo. Other conditions may be aphasia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, distractibility, memory loss, reading difficulties, low tolerance for cognitive overload, and intellectual/adaptive functioning challenges such as learning and problem-solving.

- At least 2 people of color (30% of Veterans are people of color)

- At least 2 people who live in a rural or remote area (25% of Veterans live in a rural area, but this has been estimated as high as 45%)

- At least 2 people without a degree or certifications (25% of Veterans do not have a degree or certifications, less than 50% of Veterans have a degree)

- At least 1 woman (10% of Veterans are women)

- At least 1 person with a disability rating of 70% or greater

- Consider including at least 1 person who uses a screen reader

- Consider including at least 1 non-native English speaker

If the study requires screensharing, request that Perigean confirm:

- The participant has Zoom downloaded prior to the session and they know how to screenshare 

- If the research is only testing prototypes and the participant cannot get Zoom working, they will not be able to participate

### Recruiting for usability studies
People with vision impairments who use assistive technology can be included if the research includes testing tools in production or staging environments. 

- Consider adding a recruiting requirement for at least one person who uses assistive technology such as a screen readers, [specialized keyboards](http://www.infinitec.org/alternative-keyboards), and switches

People with auditory impairments can be included in usability testing. [Refer to the FAQ section for tips on moderating these sessions.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/new/master/platform/accessibility/resources#what-if-someone-with-hearing-difficulties-joins-a-session) 

If your design prototype is created in [Adobe XD, you may be able to include assistive tech users](https://equalentry.com/designing-for-assistive-tech-in-adobe-xd-accessibility-nyc-meetup-recap/). **TL;DR**, it's not well-suited for remote research. 

It will not be possible to include those who use assistive technology if the research includes testing prototypes in tools such as InVision, UXPin, or Mural. Therefore, include the following verbiage in your research plan:

- For this session, we are unable to include those who use assistive technology, such as screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and ChromeVox).

- For this session, we are unable to include people with significant vision loss. 

- For this session, we are unable to include people who use magnification tools.

In addition, if your design prototype is created in UXPin, consider communicating that the study requires using the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Internet Explorer and Edge are not supported.

If your research uses Optimal Workshop, consider testing your research ahead of time to see if screen reader users are able to participate.


### Recruiting for discovery research 

People with disabilities can be included in generative and exploratory research through listening sessions and in-depth interviews

- For example, [listening sessions](https://indiyoung.com/how-to-build-trust-in-a-listening-session/) meet the person where they are comfortable and follow where they lead. No specialized equipment is required, only to listen to the person speak. Ideally, the session would be recorded, and notes transcribed verbatim afterwards.


## FAQ

### What if someone does join a session with a disability and cannot participate in the planned activity?

- Pivot to conduct a listening session, discovery session, or in-depth interview if you have exploratory or generative research goals for better understanding the problem space
   - Learning session example: “Tell me about a time when you accessed your account on VA.gov. What were you seeking to accomplish? When was this? What happened? What went through your mind when that happened? How did this make you feel?”

- If there’s no notetaker in the session, record the entire session and transcribe afterwards so you can place your full attention on listening to the participant

### What if someone with hearing difficulties joins a session? 

- They may need time to connect their hearing aids. Bluetooth hearing aids may experience challenges connecting to devices.

- People with hearing impairments may prefer to use chat messaging or email to communicate, value real-time captions when available. For Zoom, this may be tough because it can be hard to find the chat functionality in the interface. Providing clear directions ahead of time, for all participants, may be helpful.

- Consider [presenting visual instructions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15QLNWiWzQukn0nApoRfCAyIr1MBuGq9F4efIOXK7424/edit#slide=id.p) for accessing the Zoom chat and screen sharing functionality as part of your study’s introduction 

- People with hearing impairments may speak in ways that seem unfamiliar. A good rule of thumb is not to speak louder or “yell.” Take a moment and consider that this person is processing additional stimulus and aim to adjust to their ways. 

### What if a veteran joins with their caregiver?

- Some participants may be accompanied by a caregiver, and you may need to communicate with both the caregiver and the participant. Make sure you can clearly hear the audio from both the caregiver and participant.
