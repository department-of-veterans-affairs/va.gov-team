# Disability statistics of Veterans

* Approximately 40% of American Veterans have an identified disability, but there are likely many more that are not identified, in part due to the military culture.

* About **1.52 million (8.5 percent) Veterans had a service-connected disability rating of 70 percent or higher**.

* Of those who served after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other war zones, **about 41 percent have VA disability ratings, compared to 25 percent of Veterans of other eras**.

* **Nearly half (47.7 percent) of all Gulf War II Veterans with a disability report a cognitive difficulty**. 

* **Approximately 300,000 Veterans (18.5 percent) who have returned from Afghanistan and Iraq are currently suffering from PTSD or major depression**.

* **Over 20 Veterans take their lives each day**

* **About 320,000 (19.5 percent) report experiencing a traumatic brain injury (TBI) during deployment**.

* An estimated **31 percent of troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have a mental health condition or reported experiencing a TBI**.

* As of December 2008, over 30,000 troops have returned from a combat zone with visible wounds and a range of permanent disabilities. **An estimated 25-40 percent have less visible wounds—psychological and neurological injuries associated with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or traumatic brain injury (TBI)**, which have been dubbed “signature injuries” of the Iraq War.

## Post-9/11 Vets Have Far Higher Disability Ratings Than Prior Generations

In 2018, the nation had **19.2 million veterans, less than 8 percent of the total population**. 4.1 million of those veterans were from the Gulf War-era II period, covering September 2001 forward, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said.
In August 2018, **4.7 million veterans, or 25 percent of the total, had a service-connected disability**.
Possible reasons:
* Advances in battlefield medicine and rapid evacuations to treatment centers have resulted in more veterans surviving wounds that would have killed them in previous wars.
* There’s a heightened awareness in the military and at the VA of the aftereffects of traumatic brain injury (TBI), along with more screenings for mental health issues resulting from post-traumatic stress. Advances in the ability to diagnose PTSD are another of the many factors in the uptick in disability rates.

## Veterans and vision loss

* More than **158,000 blind or visually impaired veterans now live among us**, according to the [Blinded Veterans Association](http://visionaware.org/everyday-living/essential-skills/information-for-veterans-coping-with-vision-loss/blinded-veterans-association-bva/). That’s about 1% of all vets.
* **Each year, some 7,000 veterans become newly blind or visually impaired** as age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy affect their lives more profoundly.
* Some **17 percent of the evacuated wounded service members in Iraq and Afghanistan have suffered a serious eye injury** of one type or another.

## Lack of access to mental health services contributing to high suicide rates among veterans

* **Over 8,000 Veterans will commit suicide each year, that is 22 each day**.

* One in 4,000 Veterans without health care benefits commit suicide.

* Veterans’ efforts to gain access to quality psychological health services after multiple deployments are often met with significant obstacles. 

* Lack of access to critical mental health services may lead to suicidal behavior, especially among young military veterans who have completed multiple deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq. 

* Recent data showed an **increase of more than 18% from 2011 to 2014 in suicide rates among Army veterans**. 

* The total number of suicides differs by age group; **31% of these suicides were by veterans 49 and younger, while 69% were by veterans aged 50 and older**. Suicide of veterans is primarily male, with about 97 percent of the suicides being male in the states that reported gender.

## Reasons to believe the statistics are in fact higher than listed above

In the 1992 movie "Scent of a Woman," Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, played by Al Pacino, gives an Academy Award-winning impassioned speech that references his military service and the wounds of war:

> “I have seen boys like these, younger than these, their arms torn out, their legs ripped off. But there isn’t nothin’ like the sight of an amputated spirit; there is no prosthetic for that,” he tells the disciplinary board of an elite New England prep school.

For many service members and veterans, the source of their “amputated spirit” is most often an invisible injury, such as a traumatic brain injury (TBI). [Source](https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/480020-president-is-misinformed-about-traumatic-brain-injuries)

TBIs are generally considered the signature wound of war. Moreover, in the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were often the weapon of choice for the insurgent army, thus causing an increase in the number of TBIs diagnosed from previous wars.

Although moderate and severe traumatic head injuries can be readily identified and treated, mild TBIs and related blast injuries are often initially viewed as inconsequential and therefore overlooked in terms of treatment. 

Although a veteran with a mild TBI may not present with obvious symptoms, a missed diagnosis can lead to severe problems. Even mild TBI is associated with psychological distress, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, completed suicide, substance abuse, and depression. 

At a time when the rate of suicide among veterans and service members remains alarmingly high despite years of reform, suicide prevention efforts often overlook the role of TBI. As the VA, veterans, and stakeholders continue to prioritize suicide prevention efforts, a more direct emphasis on the diagnosis and treatment of TBI is required.

## Updates April 27, 2023 – Military Sexual Trauma (MST)

* [April 27, 2023] In a sample of 352 post-9/11 women Veterans who used VHA reproductive health care in Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 and participated in a cross-sectional survey, approximately 68.7% screened positive for MST, including 44.9% who reported experiencing military sexual assault. Notably, 30.8% reported MST on the survey, but had a negative MST screen for their most recent MST screen in their VHA medical record. [Source, Monteith, et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36695157/)

* [Mar 30, 2020] Sexual violence remains pervasive. In 2018, 20,500 service members were sexually assaulted or raped including 13,000 women and 7,500 men. The rate of sexual assault and rape jumped by almost 40% from 2016 to 2018, and for women veterans, the rate increased by over 50% to the highest level since 2006. [Source, Hill and Ponton](https://www.hillandponton.com/facts-on-military-sexual-trauma-and-statistics/#:~:text=Sexual%20violence%20remains%20pervasive.,the%20highest%20level%20since%202006)

* An estimated 1 in 4 female veterans and 1 in 100 male veterans in the VA healthcare system **report** experiencing MST. It is important to note that by percentage women are at greater risk of MST, but nearly 40% of veterans who disclose MST to VA are men.

## Veterans and hearing loss

- As of fiscal year 2020, more than 1.3 million Veterans were receiving disability compensation for hearing loss, and more than 2.3 million received compensation for tinnitus.
- In addition, many Veterans score normally on hearing tests but have difficulty understanding speech. This condition, called auditory processing disorder, is often associated with blast exposure.
- Tinnitus is the number-one disability among Veterans and affects at least 1 in 10 American adults.
