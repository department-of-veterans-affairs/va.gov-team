# Test Cases Checklist for VSA Teams

Here is Markdown that you may add to your Staging Review request template. 

## VSP _requires_ VFS teams conduct their own accessibility testing prior to requesting a VSP CC Staging Review.

The current documentation refers to TestRail or a series of steps to document in Github. However, it is only necessary to certify your team has completed the series of checks. 

To help with conducting this internal audit, I created this _optional_ [VSA accessibility review steps tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xHwdyQAwbsAnD5pTHGaMxpS9XfdbBVcVVTvulgWI7dw/edit#gid=0), modeled after what I use when I do an accessibility audit. I find it helps me keep track of what I've done. 

It may help to go into Edit this document, copy the following Markdown, and paste into your Staging Review request template.

  - **TestRail** [TestRail VSP accessibility test plan template](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/index.php?/plans/view/105) **OR**
