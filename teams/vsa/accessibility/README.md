### How does accessibility fit into our product lifecycle?

#### Product
* Define accessibility as a business requirement from the start
* Train the team
* Plan for inclusive research
* Meaningfully measure, monitor, and evaluate success goals, including accessibility and Section 508 compliance

#### Research
* Define inclusive research strategies ([review inclusive research guidelines](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/inclusive-research-recommendations.md))
* Define goals and strategies for including people with disabilities (consider specific KPIs)

#### Design
* Define how to cultivate cognitive empathy with marginalized populations across the project (economically- and technology-challenged individuals, people with disabilities)
* Interaction behavior is documented and accessible
* Define criteria to evaluate the accessibility of designs, such as mobile-first, defining states, heading order, focus management

#### Development
* Establish e2e tests that include the axe checks
* Ensure engineering knows how to customize tests to ensure hidden and dynamic content is also evaluated
* Define workflow processes to evaluate 508 compliance and accessibility during development

#### QA
* UX QA techniques to evaluate accessibility and usability: manual processes, Web Vitals, CrUX dashboard
* Accessibility and 508 compliance processes before and after deployment
