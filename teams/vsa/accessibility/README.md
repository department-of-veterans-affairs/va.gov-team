### How does accessibility fit into our product lifecycle?

#### Product
* Define accessibility and performance budgets as business requirements from the start â€” and stick to them 
* Meaningfully measure, monitor, and evaluate success goals, such as: call center volume, time on site, web performance metrics, accessibility  and Section 508 compliance

#### Research
* Define inclusive research strategies (good start reference)
* Define goals, and strategies, for including people with disabilities (specific KPIs?)

#### Design
* Define how we will cultivate cognitive empathy with marginalized populations across the project (economically and technology challenged individuals, people with disabilities)
* Define criteria to evaluate the accessibility of designs, such as starting mobile-first, ensuring states, headings, focus management, behavior is documented and accessible

#### Development
* Establish e2e tests that include the axe checks
* Ensure engineering knows how to customize tests to ensure hidden and dynamic content is also evaluated
* Define workflow processes to evaluate 508 compliance and accessibility during development

#### QA
* UX QA techniques to evaluate accessibility and usability: manual processes, Web Vitals, CrUX dashboard
* Accessibility and 508 compliance processes before and after deployment

## VSA Accessibility Dashboard

The VSA accessibility specialist is measuring and monitoring a number of metrics to evaluate if processes and resources are improving the quality of accessibility in our work. The [VSA Accessibility Dashboard](https://sites.google.com/d/1TaKZ5-By8oAv9M-HBhyylpw14-3UXDdp/p/1doeOzfSq_zSeBl7_iBzezsaNJWqUgsDy/edit) is available for anyone who has access to GCIO's Google Drive. Please contact Jennifer if you don't have access and would like to review.

<!-- 
Starting with sprint 14, I am tracking the 508 issues on VA.gov, and specific to VSA teams, to evaluate and measure accessibility efforts and impact on design/dev quality.
