- [ ] Deque axe browser scan audit to identify accessibility issues
- [ ] Deque axe-coconut browser scan audit to identify leading edge accessibility issues
- [ ] Lighthouse browser scan audit to identify web performance impact
- [ ] Navigate and tab through the page using keyboard only
- [ ] Navigate the page using JAWS with IE11
- [ ] Navigate the page using NVDA with Firefox
- [ ] Navigate the page using VO with Safari
- [ ] Resize the page 400% with a screen width of 1280px to test mobile
- [ ] As available/possible, access and navigate the page using available mobile devices, in both portrait and landscape
- [ ] Visual evaluation to identify cognitive considerations to align with WCAG
- [ ] Create Epic to contain issues found, assign to yourself
- [ ] Add issues found to the [508 Product Review List](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/508-product-review-list.md) (This will be used to create the weekly email to the 508 Office.)
- [ ] ~~Add issues to the [GCIO Sprint Checkoff Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1031rFMfaUQKMLLA0yybGNz9tMIH7WtTVwVWCOsjep0E/edit?ts=5d77e7f8#heading=h.rsumqrms2hm2)~~
- [ ] If the issues are sitewide, design system, components, or CMS issues, add to the [Tracking VSP a11y issues affecting VSA teams](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v1TjvvXaTOun1ZFBoOVeDqZlQVr5leD_YVEnDPntxLI/edit#gid=0) spreadsheet; remove the teams label from the ticket, but keep it in the epic for the review.
- [ ] If the issues are related to Leaflet or Mapbox, add the 508-issue-leaflet-mapbox label, then add to the [spreadsheet on the Vendor tab]((https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v1TjvvXaTOun1ZFBoOVeDqZlQVr5leD_YVEnDPntxLI/edit#gid=0)). Keep the team assigned to the issue.
