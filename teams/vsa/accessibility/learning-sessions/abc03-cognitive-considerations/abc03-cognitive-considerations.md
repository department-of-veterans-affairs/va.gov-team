## Subject Matter 

We are going to touch on PTSD, mental injuries/illness, and other cognitive considerations. I aim for this to be a safe space where we may speak about these tough subjects, but acknowledge this may be hard.
It’s okay to take a break if you need to. 

## Agenda and intro

* What are Cognitive Considerations?
* Design Considerations
* Technology Solutions
* “~~Just ask for help.~~”
* Accessibility Compliance

### According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health is “a state of well-being in which the individual 

* realizes [their] own abilities, 
* can cope with the normal stresses of life, 
* can work productively and fruitfully, 
* and is able to make a contribution to [their] community”


### In the United States
* 1 in 5 adults experience a mental illness in a given year.
* 1 in 25 adults live with a serious mental illness.
* 6.9 percent of adults live with major depression.
* 18.1 percent of adults live with an anxiety disorder.
* African Americans and Hispanic Americans use mental health services at ½ the rate of whites. 
* Asian Americans at ⅓ the rate of whites.
* LGBTQ individuals are 2 or more times more likely as straight individuals to have a mental health condition.
* Depression and anxiety have a significant economic impact; the estimated cost to the global economy is US$ 1 trillion per year in lost productivity.

### Since October 2001, approximately 1.64 million U.S. troops have deployed to support operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. 

* A study conducted by the RAND corporation estimates approximately 300,000 veterans who have returned from Afghanistan and Iraq are currently suffering from PTSD or major depression, and about 320,000 may have experienced a traumatic brain injury (TBI) during deployment.
* Approximately 18.5 percent of U.S. service members who have returned from Afghanistan and Iraq currently have post-traumatic stress disorder or depression; and 19.5 percent report experiencing a traumatic brain injury during deployment.

### What do you think of these stats?

## What are Cognitive Considerations?

### A disability is a condition that limits a major life activity. 

### Accessibility helps more than just the blind 

There are five disability types that are commonly considered in digital accessibility: 
* seeing
* hearing
* speaking
* moving 
* thinking

“Thinking” includes disabilities that impact emotions, problem-solving, memory, and other ways we use our brain.

### “Thinking” disabilities

Cognitive disabilities are by far the most common type of disability and may arise as a result of:
* congenital conditions from birth
* developmental conditions from a young age
* traumatic injury, infections, chemical imbalances, or other conditions later in life

They may also be situational considerations attributed to fatigue, environmental stimulus, or being new to a situation.

### Some types of cognitive disabilities

### Cognitive disability spectrum

- There are so many different kinds, and so many variations. 
- An individual may experience a deficit in only one area, rather than all of them. 
- Some trends or categories are worth listing, not because they apply to everyone, but because they are part of the cognitive disability spectrum.

### Functional disabilities

We consider cognitive disabilities by functional disability. Functional disabilities ignore the medical or behavioral causes of the disability and instead focus on the resulting abilities and challenges. Cognitive disabilities impact the capacity of an individual to:

- think
- concentrate
- react to emotions
- formulate ideas
- problem solve
- reason
- remember

## Design Considerations

### Limited Comprehension

Most people with cognitive disabilities experience limited comprehension of one kind or another. 
- They may not be able to understand complex ideas. 
- They may have difficulty with metaphors or abstract language. 
- They may not understand some kinds of slang or idiomatic expressions. 
- Some people with cognitive disabilities have exceptionally high cognitive functions in one area — the ability to remember numbers or conversations — but low cognitive functions in other areas, such as social skills or emotional awareness.

### Considerations for lower comprehension

Users who have lower comprehension will have a better experience if the interface and content are easy to use and understand. Too many options and complex information may be difficult for them to process.

- Simplify the interface as much as possible (reduce content, provide structure). 
- Simplify the content as much as possible (i.e., PlainLanguage.gov). 
- Keep content to short sentences, bullets, good summarizing headings.
- Keep videos and audio as short as possible.
- Limit the number of choices on the screen.
- Provide help features, especially contextual help.
- Design for ease of use, anticipate possible errors.
- Test the usability of the interface with actual users, preferably including users with cognitive disabilities.

Here's an example on VA.gov where we might apply the above considerations to improve the experience for those with lower consideration (and everyone): 
[About VA Health Benefits](https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/)

### Short-Term Memory Loss

Some people with cognitive disabilities have a hard time remembering things from one moment to the next. Their brains don’t allow them to focus on new information, so they don’t retain it in the short term. 

Long web processes — such as online purchasing procedures, account sign-up procedures, or setting preferences — can cause users to forget what they were doing, or to lose track of information that they may need to remember from one step to the next. 

VA.gov example: see the [526 form](https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/)

Notice the long loading indicators with no information about what is loading. We could rewrite our loading messages to be more specific about what page we're waiting on, or have text on the page that doesn't rely on the data being called.

### People with memory loss

A website that has predictability across all its pages (same navigation, same structure, etc.) will greatly benefit users with memory loss. Sites that are too complicated may fatigue users with memory loss. If users have difficulty interacting with the web page, help features can assist them with navigating the web page.

- Retain information across screens, and within a path.
- Provide help features, particularly contextual help.

  <caption>On VA.gov, form data reiterates who the information is for. In this case, the label reads "Veteran's First Name" in the Veteran's section, and "Primary Caregiver's First Name" in the section for the Primary Caregiver's information.</caption>

    </tr>
  </tbody>

### Attention Deficit

Some users experience attention deficits, making it hard for them to focus on the task at hand. They may 

- get lost in their own thoughts…
- find online ads or long loading indicators distracting…

causing them to forget why they went to the website in the first place.

### People with distractibility

Too many distractions on a web page may cause people with cognitive disabilities to miss important information being conveyed on a web page. Distractions may cause them to lose focus or overwhelm them, and users may navigate from the web page.

- Reduce or eliminate distractions 
- Be careful with motion, ads, carousels, intrusive audio, intrusive video, etc.
- Allow user to stop / control 

On the modernized VA.gov, there aren't animations, ads, or carousels presently. That's helpful. When a link takes someone to a new page, if we add and id to the url and 'automagically' scroll to content, it may trigger motion or cognitive issues. It's helpful to test with a variety of devices and people. When in doubt, it is best practice to not use scrolling animation (a.k.a., 'smooth-scroll'), and instead opt to immediately go to the area.

### Low Tolerance for Cognitive Overload

Some people with cognitive disabilities easily become frustrated or upset when they sense difficult situations, or when there are too many things in their environment happening at the same time. They cannot handle the complexity of the moment, may need to take a break. They need things to be simple and straightforward. Too many choices can cause them to freeze, and they may be emotionally unable to change their state of mind for a period of time.

### Limited Problem-Solving Skills

When presented with a problem to solve, some people with cognitive disabilities may simply be unable to solve it, so they may not even attempt to solve it. If a website requires users to type text in a CAPTCHA, for instance, they may not be able to process what kind of action is required.
If they type an incorrect response and get an error message, they may not be able to figure out why they got the error message, or how to solve the problem.

### Difficulty Reading

Many people with cognitive disabilities experience difficulty reading. 
- Some read at a lower level than their peers of the same age, and some can't read at all. It can help to provide illustrations or audio to supplement text. 
- Some people with dyslexia have high levels of cognitive function at a conceptual level, but visual encoding of text can be difficult, so they have a hard time spelling or reading words.
- Some with dyslexia read the ‘shapes’ rather than letters.

Try the [Dyslexia Bookmarklet](https://data.qz.com/2016/dyslexia/) on the [About Health Benefits on VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/), to see a simulation of what it may look like for a person with dyslexia.

### Designing for dyslexia

Although the number of people with dyslexia is far greater than the number of blind users, few building experiences know how to design for them.

#### Typography 
- try to use a sans-serif font
- ‘hooks’ on serif letters may distort shapes
- if you must use a serif, reduce letter-spacing slightly
- explore typefaces developed for dyslexic users
- avoid using italics and underlines which can visually distort text
- bold is recommended for emphasis 

#### Layout 
- aim for columns of no more than 80 characters per line
- narrower columns make reading easier
- use percentage widths for text areas 
- set margins to “0 auto” via CSS so margins adjust proportionately
- white space is your friend, but must be consistent

#### Tools 
- offer readability tools, such as text-to-audio option via an automated tool 
- ensure your markup activates functionality like iOS Reader Mode

#### Navigation 
- keep navigation as logical as possible
- ensure Home page is accessible throughout your website or app, offering reassurance if people start feeling confused

### Difficulty Understanding or Using Math

Some people experience math anxiety, which is an emotional or psychological fear that grips some people when confronted with math problems. This is less of an intellectual deficit than a psychological deficit. Other people truly cannot solve mathematical problems because their brains are not capable of that kind of thinking.

In the case of the VA.gov Disability Calculator, people with difficulties understanding or using math would benefit from text explaining why the numbers don't add up, placed close to the total rating.
