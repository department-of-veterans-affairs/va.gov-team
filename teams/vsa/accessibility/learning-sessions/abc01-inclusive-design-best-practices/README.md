<blockquote><strong>&ldquo;Inclusion is a vast promise &mdash; as immense, in fact, as human diversity &mdash; and that&rsquo;s what makes it a great design challenge. But without a clear agreement on what inclusion is, can we ever hope to achieve it? How can we design for something that means so many different things to different people?&rdquo;</strong> 

— Kat Holmes, author of Mismatch, How Inclusion Shapes Design
</blockquote>

## What It Is And What It Isn’t

<blockquote><strong>Every choice we make <strike>as designers</strike> determines who can use an environment or product.</strong></blockquote>

Every decision we make can raise or lower barriers to participation in society. It’s our collective responsibility to lower these barriers though inclusive products, services, environments, and experiences.

The mismatches that we create in the process are the building blocks of exclusion. 

From the stairs at the entrance of a building to the two-handed design of a video game controller, our solutions clearly signal who does and doesn’t belong. Source: [Medium post](https://medium.com/aiga-eye-on-design/what-were-leaving-out-of-the-discussion-around-inclusive-design-d058f44f88e1)

“Now we look at a small sheet of glass on a sunny day, we juggle our phones one-handed, we’re distracted or in a rush. We are, quite literally, temporarily vision, motor, hearing, and cognitively impaired on a daily basis.” (Robin Christopherson, head of digital inclusion at UK tech charity AbilityNet)

Robin pointed out that without accessibility at the very heart of everything you do, you will be producing websites and apps that leave not only disabled shoppers, but almost every one of your customers, frustrated and keen to take their money elsewhere.

### Inclusive design focuses on the diversity of people and considers the impact on design decisions.

* Recognize exclusion
* Learn from diversity
* Solve for one, extend to many

**Inclusive design:** A design methodology that enables and draws on the full range of human diversity. Most importantly, this means including and learning from people with a range of perspectives. Designing inclusively doesn’t mean you’re making one thing for all people. You’re designing a diversity of ways for everyone to participate in an experience with a sense of belonging. Many people are unable to participate in aspects of society, both physical and digital. Understanding why and how people are excluded gives us actionable steps to take towards inclusive design.

The premise of inclusive design is that apart from permanent disabilities there are temporary, situational, or changing disabilities that affect us all. We use mobile devices in noisy environments, we struggle with screen glare in sunlight, and we attempt to tap links on touch screens that are positioned too close to each other—all of which leaves us temporarily impaired.

### Accessibility

1. The qualities that make an experience open to all.
2. A professional discipline aimed at achieving No. 1.

An important distinction is that accessibility is an _attribute_, while inclusive design is a _method_. And while practicing inclusive design should make your products more accessible, it’s not a process for meeting all accessibility standards. Ideally, accessibility and inclusive design work together to make experiences that are not only compliant with standards, but truly usable and open to all.

### Universal design is another concept closely related to inclusive design

**Universal Design** is defined as the design of an environment so that it might be accessed and used in the widest possible range of situations without the need for adaptation.

### Inclusive design — what it is & isn’t

Inclusive design, universal design, and accessibility are important for different reasons and have different strengths. 

#### Inclusive design 
* Might not lead to universal designs
* Considers situational impairments, which we all experience on a daily basis
* One-size-fits-one

#### Universal design
* Might not involve the participation of excluded communities 
* One-size-fits-all

Accessibility is an *attribute*, while Inclusive Design and Universal Design are *methods*. Accessible solutions aren’t always designed to consider human diversity or emotional qualities like beauty or dignity. They simply need to provide access.

**Inclusive design** should always start with a solid understanding of accessibility fundamentals. 

Accessibility criteria are the foundation of integrity for any inclusive solution.

Designers should be familiar with all three. An inclusive designer is someone, arguably anyone, who recognizes and remedies mismatched interactions between people and their world. They seek out the expertise of people who navigate exclusionary designs. The expertise of excluded communities gives insight into a diversity of ways to participate in an experience.

## Why Inclusive Design Matters

<blockquote><strong>Exclusion happens when we solve problems using our own biases.</strong></blockquote>

**Recognize Exclusion** — Today when we talk about disabilities and related limitations, we include situational impairments, activity limitations, and restrictions on participation. We consider mismatches between individuals and their environments, situations, and society as a whole. [Microsoft Inclusive Design Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/)

For example: For example, a designer assumed a person who is blind wouldn’t use a photocopier. Yet, they might use a photocopier to make copies for others or to copy pages from a book in order to scan them into a speech output program.

### Recognize exclusion

Sometimes exclusion is temporary. Sometimes exclusion is situational. 

Even a short-term injury or context affects the way people interact with the world around them, if only for a short time. Think about looking into a bright light, wearing a cast, or ordering dinner in a foreign country.

As people move through different environments, their abilities can also change dramatically. In a loud crowd, they can’t hear well. In a car, they’re visually impaired. New parents spend much of their day doing tasks one-handed. An overwhelming day can cause sensory overload. What’s possible, safe, and appropriate is constantly changing.

### Recognize exclusion: Disability defined, then and now

“The concept of "disability" may have limited the understanding of the need for accessible technology … the IT industry must consider the wide range of people who could benefit.” - [Microsoft (2003)](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/)

One finding of Microsoft’s report [The Wide Range of Abilities and Its Impact on Computer Technology](https://download.microsoft.com/download/0/1/f/01f506eb-2d1e-42a6-bc7b-1f33d25fd40f/researchreport.doc) is that, before developers of technology products can address the growing demand for accessible products effectively, they must first acknowledge the reality that the concept of disability may have previously limited their understanding of that need.

### Recognize exclusion: Disability difficulties prevalence

A 2003 report by Microsoft revealed people struggle more than generally thought:
* 25% – Severe Difficulties
* 37% – Mild Difficulties
* 16% – Minimal Difficulties
* 21% – No difficulties

The prevalence data and definitions of difficulty levels are drawn from the [Microsoft (2003) survey.](http://www.inclusivedesigntoolkit.com/whatis/whatis.html#p20)

### Learn from Diversity

When experiences don’t serve people the way they should, people adapt. Sometimes in astonishing ways that the designers never intended. **The insight is in the adaptation.**

Interactions with technology depend heavily on what we can see, hear, say, touch, learn, and remember. Mobile tech can make situational limitations highly relevant to many people today. Mobile puts in focus questions like: Are we forced to adapt to technology, or is technology adapting to us?

_Further information:_ A report by Microsoft (2003): [The Wide Range of Abilities and its Impact on Computer Technology](http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/1/f/01f506eb-2d1e-42a6-bc7b-1f33d25fd40f/researchreport.doc) presents survey results on the range of abilities in the US population and discusses the current and potential market for accessible technology. A paper by Lange and Becerra (2007): [Teaching universal design in Colombia: the academic approach of two universities](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309800043_Teaching_Universal_Design_in_Colombia_The_Academic_Approach_of_Two_Universities) discusses perceptions of disability and explains how it is ‘normal to be different’.

<blockquote><strong>Learn how people adapt to the world by spending time understanding their experience from their perspective.</strong></blockquote>

Empathy is an important part of many different forms of design. When building empathy for exclusion and disability, it’s misleading to rely only on simulating different abilities through blindfolds and earplugs. Learning how people adapt to the world around them means spending time understanding their experience from their perspective.

### Solve for one, extend to many

Designing for people with permanent disabilities can seem like a significant constraint, but the resulting designs can actually benefit a much larger number of people. 

For example, closed captioning was created for the hard of hearing community. But, there are many benefits of captioning such as reading in a crowded airport, or, teaching children how to read.

Everyone experiences exclusion as they interact with our designs. On the other hand, a solution that works well for someone who’s blind might also benefit any person driving a car. Inclusive design works across a spectrum of related abilities, connecting different people in similar circumstances. High-contrast screen settings were initially made to benefit people with vision impairments. But today, many people benefit from high-contrast settings when they use a device in bright sunlight. The same is true for remote controls, automatic door openers, audiobooks, email, and much more. Designing with constraints in mind is simply designing well.
* One of the central ideas of inclusive design is that designing for people with disabilities will result in better designs that will benefit everyone. 
* Considering the popular technological innovations that were originally designed to help people with disabilities—email, cell phones and texting have all been developed to facilitate communication with the deaf—this is not really a radical notion. 
* What is radical is that Microsoft, a major global company, has wholeheartedly embraced the inclusive design philosophy.
* Assuming all those senses and abilities are fully enabled all the time creates the potential to ignore much of the range of humanity.

## Where You Make a Difference
_**How to weave inclusive design throughout your work**_

<blockquote><strong>Inclusive design should be a part of every stage of product development. A product created without inclusive design considerations will exclude a large audience.</strong></blockquote>

Inclusive design needs to be considered at every stage when building a product, including strategy, design, and development, highlighted Sarah Federman, a design engineer at Adobe. “At the design stage, we need to consider things like documenting expected keyboard interaction and reading order, color contrast, and text and media accessibility,” she recommended. “Project managers need to be tracking this and developers need to know how their app should behave—not just how it looks. It's a shared responsibility across the entire organization.”

Sarah also emphasized that none of the work done at any stage matters if it doesn’t make it out the door. If you do an amazing job documenting keyboard accessibility but a developer never sees it or it was implemented incorrectly, your work ends up having little value for your end users. Communication and follow-through is really key to delivering a great inclusive experience.

A [recent survey of Facebook users](https://www.facebook.com/accessibility/posts/1773602802683437?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAIlOXGgTDDs0qFETjvLFdzo39MBOw9Axr9wFIUM8XiCRHbsQrfmgvMkoI8JodQVvIdWlMyvmihWqhRBgCUhb9ir2L98JpmDrWSCh3qlIaxGLjYxbL2tqb25GCozidpriZE0IF8Dw4GDj99C0d7fztDwBAEwONdjX1_08DH106aeFZiYlOt_yOTuv233MKCIUUcZVJQ4vA9djarGGYv1bqx304uRHqTUPuB7oWOBJzqxN_aGPYFhRV0kn5_VfqOQfpxAHG81-VtheEf8GKhPyXmyJU050XNd8Uf9yyWJ4dAspi0O3e3V6_07D_7Fzx6gCD67xofbWJjVBtEIN5TV-p-hA&__tn__=-R) in 50 countries found that more than 30 percent of people report difficulty with at least one of the following: seeing, hearing, speaking, organizing thoughts, walking, or grasping with their hands. [Facebook Accessibility - May 17, 2018] Worse still, non-inclusive content and experiences will push people away. And it’s not always easy to pinpoint when that’s happening. Excluded web visitors often don’t complain: 71 percent will just leave. Ensuring experiences are accessible means recognizing exclusion, learning from your audience, and presenting information in the clearest ways possible. 

### Start with accessibility

Incorporating accessibility early…
* _decreases_ the time and expense to design accessible products
* _increases_ the overall positive impact accessibility can have

It can be very costly to make required design changes if accessibility is only addressed late in product design and development.

### Accessibility at the end incurs problems

Accessibility “bolted on” at the end is usually much less effective for people with disabilities, and less beneficial for others. For example,
* A building architecturally planned for accessibility from the beginning may include a wheelchair-accessible entrance that elegantly and practically fits the aesthetic, _versus…_
* A building with a ramp added on after the building was designed, and the doorways modified after it was built to accommodate necessary width for a wheelchair and service dog scenario.

This relates to digital design, as well, impacting systems architecture, personas, user journeys, design systems, page templates, information architecture, and semantic markup. Not only is it expensive to re-architect these systems, it is complicated, time-consuming, and introduces risk.

<blockquote><strong>The best way to understand the diverse range of people you want to serve is to _work with them_ and learn how they interact with the world around them.</strong></blockquote>

### Include people with disabilities

It may seem daunting to include people with disabilities on your project team. While it may not be feasible in all cases, if you can, you will gain great return on your investment, including:
* **Motivation** — When designers, managers, and other stakeholders see people with disabilities using their product, most are inspired with a new understanding of the impact of accessibility issues.
* **Efficiency** — Including users with disabilities early in a project helps the team more efficiently address accessibility. This maximizes results from the investment as they more quickly develop accessible solutions, spend less time guessing, and avoid having to fix problems afterwards.
* **Effectiveness** — When a team understands issues, they implement more effective, accessible solutions.

<blockquote><strong>Evaluate data. It’s only as good as those collecting and assessing it. Diverse teams are crucial in this.</strong></blockquote>

“Data isn’t a be-all end-all,” warned Ivana McConnell, senior UI/UX designer at Customer.io. “When making decisions based on data, remember that data is only as good as those collecting it and asking questions of it. Diverse teams, built with inclusive hiring practices, are imperative. They bring the viewpoints which help keep data accountable, and ask the right questions of that data. Numbers are only as neutral as the people using them.”

### Accessibility considerations at the start:

- [ ] Research requirements and standards for your products – accessibility, legal, etc.
- [ ] Establish internal policies and guidelines for accessibility and inclusion
- [ ] Plan, budget, and schedule to include a diverse range of people, including those with disabilities, as project co-creators and on your teams
- [ ] Steward inclusive design and accessibility expertise through training and hiring
- [ ] Instead of evaluating accessibility separately, integrate checks where they fit best within your current reviews, testing, and quality assurance (QA)
- [ ] Business and usability goals include accessibility requirements

<blockquote><strong>&ldquo;Designing for inclusion is not a feel-good sideline.&hellip; inclusion can be a source of innovation and growth, especially for digital technologies. It can be a catalyst for creativity and a boost for the bottom line as a customer base expands. And each time we remedy a mismatched interaction, we create an opportunity for more people to contribute to society in meaningful ways.&rdquo;</strong><br/>
 — John Maeda, in the forward to Kat Holmes’ <em>Mismatch, How Inclusion Shapes Design</em>
 </blockquote>

### Individual differences

Be careful not to assume that feedback from one person with a disability applies to all people with disabilities. 

People with disabilities are as varied as any users; they come from a variety of backgrounds and have varied interests, likes and dislikes, goals and skills. They have different experiences, different expectations, and different preferences. They use different interaction techniques, different adaptive strategies, and different assistive technology configurations.

A person with a disability doesn't necessarily know how other people with the same disability interact with products, nor know enough about other disabilities to provide valid guidance on other accessibility issues. Just as you would not make design decisions based on feedback from just one user, don't make accessibility decisions based only on the recommendations of one person with a disability. What works for one person might not work for everyone with that disability or for people with other disabilities.

### Set usability goals

Most usability goals should be the same for all users, regardless of disability. 

Usability goals or usability objectives are targets for product usability that are defined in the Analysis Phase and usually measured with usability testing. Usability goals include measurable behavior and specific criteria, such as time-on-task, number of errors, and completion or success rate. 

### First time use versus familiar use

Many usability goals and usability tests focus on new product users; time-on-task for first time use. Such usability goals might be different for some users with disabilities, because in some cases a user with a disability might be slower the first time they use a new product, yet after becoming familiar with the product they may complete tasks just as fast or faster than a user without a disability.

For frequently-used products and tasks, you might decide that efficient first time use is not as important, and thus modify your usability goal to focus on time-on-task once a user is familiar with the product. For example, you might change a usability goal from “the first time the user uses the product”, to “after the user has used the product for two days”.

### Usability goals for critical & non-critical tasks

While there may be relaxed usability goals for certain tasks under some circumstances, it is important critical tasks be completed as efficiently and effectively by people with disabilities. When considering acceptable modifications of usability goals consider the importance and frequency of the task. Consider if the task is:

* Core, primary functionality
* Supplemental, secondary functionality
* Frequent maintenance, such as changing a battery
* Initial set up and installation
* Periodic maintenance and repair

For core, primary functionality it is usually important people with disabilities can meet the same usability goals; whereas, for periodic maintenance and repair it may not be important. Source: [http://uiaccess.com/accessucd/analysis.html](http://uiaccess.com/accessucd/analysis.html)

### User analysis

Product design that considers the needs of people with disabilities is still relatively uncommon. As a result, the range of users who can use products and the situations in which products can be used is less inclusive than if the needs of people with a wider range of abilities and disabilities were considered in design.

* Include accessibility considerations in user group profiles and personas. People with disabilities are potentially members of all user groups, accessibility considerations apply to all user group profiles. 
* Don’t make assumptions about tools and services people with disabilities might use. For example, a designer assumed a person who is blind wouldn’t use a photocopier. Yet, they might use a photocopier to make copies for others or to copy pages from a book in order to scan them into a speech output program.

Another example: A usability testing participant with low vision remarked when he was frustrated by inaccessible websites when he was comparing auto insurance rates for his wife's car and he said, "as though a person who doesn't drive would not be buying auto insurance."

### Example user profile: retirees

*Background:*
HRWeb is a HR Management web-based application used by Acme Insurance, used for employee records, compensation, and benefits management. User Groups include: hr managers, hr specialists, hr administrative assistants, non-hr managers, non-hr administrative assistants, employees, retired employees. There are 2,580 Retirees active in the HRWeb database. They range in age from 57–96. 60% are male, 40% are female. Most live throughout the U.S.

### Example user profile: retirees

*Environment:* 
According to the 2000 U.S. census: 24.3 % of households with people over 65 had computers in their homes. 

Some of the Acme retirees use a computer at home. Some use a computer at the local library, senior center, neighbor, or their children's house. Most of the retirees who use a computer at home are comfortable with the way they have the workstation, chair, and desk space set up. Acme retirees reported that distractions at home include phone calls, interruptions by a spouse or grandchildren, and background noise such as television or radio in the next room. 25% of the retirees using the computer at home have a dedicated line for that purpose. Those who have only one phone line mentioned being interrupted so someone else could use the phone.

Note: Many Acme retirees who use a computer other than at home have problems concentrating because of background noise, and a few complain of glare on the monitor because of overhead fluorescent lights.

### Example user profile: retirees

*Frequency of Use:* 
Frequency of use of HRWeb varies greatly across the Retirees user group. Only 30% of retirees use the web-based application, the rest interact through mail and phone calls to hr. Of those who do use HRWeb:
* 30% use it once a year, at tax time
* 50% use it about once a month, primarily to check the status of their retirement savings account balance
* 20% use it a couple times per week, to check or change investment options

Note: Users in the retiree group are more likely to have poor memory. Therefore, even some who use the application frequently will benefit from design that does not rely heavily on memory, particularly short-term memory.

### Workflow analysis

Workflow analysis defines user task processes. Workflow diagrams document the steps for completing a task, show the user roles that perform particular steps, identify where the product is involved, and are used to evaluate product design. Workflow diagrams, which are often flowcharts, are just one way to model user tasks. Scenarios are another tool for capturing task processes in a text format.

When including accessibility in workflow analysis, observe people with disabilities using the product or similar products to ensure that the workflow diagrams and scenarios include adaptive strategies used to complete the task. Document scenarios including use of assistive technology.

### Importance of Multiple Approaches in Design

Accessibility is most effectively and efficiently incorporated into product design when it is addressed with different approaches from the beginning of design. 
* Common pitfalls to avoid in design are focusing only on limited standards and not considering accessibility until the end of the design process.
* Product designers who are required to follow specific accessibility standards often jump right into the technical standards without understanding accessibility issues. 
* Trying to follow accessibility standards without an understanding of accessibility is both frustrating and ineffective.

### Following standards without understanding 

*Example*
* A web developer who doesn't know what it's like to use a screen reader comes to the web accessibility guideline “Provide text alternatives for all non-text content.” 
* To meet this guideline, the developer provides the alt text: "This image is a line art drawing of a dark green magnifying glass. If you click on it, it will take you to the Search page for this Acme Company website." 
* He writes similarly verbose alt text for hundreds of different images on his website… wasting a whole lot of time and effort on an ineffective solution. 
* For the image that takes you to the search page, the alt text “Search” is all that was needed.
* His overly descriptive text throughout the site will be extremely frustrating for people who need alt text, because they will have to wade through all the extraneous information. If he had some basic understanding of accessibility issues and had watched someone use websites with a screen reader, he would not have made that mistake.

### Understanding the range of functional limitations

Ensuring that the designers understand the wide range of functional limitations at the beginning of the design phase helps avoid costly changes later.

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Subpart C -- § 1194.31 Functional performance criteria:

  a. At least one mode of operation and information retrieval that does not require user vision shall be provided, or support for assistive technology used by people who are blind or visually impaired shall be provided.
  b. At least one mode of operation and information retrieval that does not require visual acuity greater than 20/70 shall be provided in audio and enlarged print output working together or independently, or support for assistive technology used by people who are visually impaired shall be provided.
  c. At least one mode of operation and information retrieval that does not require user hearing shall be provided, or support for assistive technology used by people who are deaf or hard of hearing shall be provided.

### P O U R

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)  guidelines and Success Criteria are organized around the following four principles, which lay the foundation necessary for anyone to access and use Web content. Anyone who wants to use the Web must have content that is:
* **Perceivable** - Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. This means that users must be able to perceive the information being presented (it can't be invisible to all of their senses).
* **Operable** - User interface components and navigation must be operable. This means that users must be able to operate the interface (the interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform).
* **Understandable** - Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable. This means that users must be able to understand the information as well as the operation of the user interface (the content or operation cannot be beyond their understanding).
* **Robust** - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. This means that users must be able to access the content as technologies advance (as technologies and user agents evolve, the content should remain accessible).

**Questions to Ask**

*Perceivable:* Can users perceive the content? This helps us keep in mind that just because something is perceivable with one sense, such as sight, that doesn't mean that all users can perceive it.

*Operable:* Can users use UI components and navigate the content? For example, something that requires a hover interaction cannot be operated by someone who can't use a mouse or touch screen.

*Understandable:* Can users understand the content? Can users understand the interface and is it consistent enough to avoid confusion?

*Robust:* Can the content be consumed by a wide variety of user agents (browsers)? Does it work with assistive technology?

### Evaluate early and throughout

If designers focus only on meeting the minimum requirements of a limited standard, the resulting product can have accessibility problems that impede usability for people with disabilities. Understanding how people interact with the product in limiting conditions is a start to avoiding unusable accessibility features; evaluation provides confirmation.

Evaluate early and throughout the design phase. Evaluating early design prototypes helps you validate design aspects that work well, and find potential accessibility barriers while it is still relatively easy and inexpensive to fix them.

 Yes, but it takes work.&rdquo;</strong><br/>

## How to Measure Inclusive Efforts

<blockquote><strong>&ldquo;Designing for simplicity tomorrow will be impossible unless we make the effort to understand the underlying complexities of how we design today. If we don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;ll only create more mismatches. We&rsquo;ll create experiences that are simple for people like ourselves, only.&rdquo;</strong><br/>
 — John Maeda, in the forward to Kat Holmes&rsquo; <em>Mismatch, How Inclusion Shapes Design</em></blockquote>

### Evaluating for accessibility

A key aspect of a successful design process is evaluating early and throughout the process.
* **Comprehensive Accessibility Evaluation** — ensure that your accessibility solutions are usable by people with disabilities
* **Accessibility Standards Review** — more rigorous than typical user interface reviews, especially when conformance to a standard is a legal requirement; tools provide some automated review, human evaluation is still necessary
* **Heuristic Evaluation** — accessibility specialists judge whether elements conform to established accessibility and usability principles
* **Design Walkthroughs** —  find potential usability problems by envisioning the user's route through an early concept or prototype
* **Screening Techniques** — simple, inexpensive activities to identify potential accessibility barriers
* **Usability Testing** — quantitative and qualitative data from real users performing real tasks 

Effective accessibility evaluation includes both evaluation expertise and the experience of people with disabilities. If you have people with disabilities easily available to help with evaluation, such as employees in the same building, you probably want to do lots of informal evaluation with them on early design prototypes. In the more common case where it takes more effort to get people with disabilities for evaluation, you probably want to employ the other evaluation methods first.

If you have limited budget you might need to do the evaluations yourself, or you might be able to afford an accessibility specialist. An accessibility expert with first-hand experience of how people with different disabilities interact with products can:
* evaluate accessibility issues for a broad range of users, which might not be found by a few individual users in usability testing;
* help fix any known accessibility barriers before bringing in users; and 
* focus usability testing or informal evaluation with users on potential areas of concern.

While each evaluation plan will be different based on resources and other factors, ensure that you employ comprehensive evaluation that includes at least a little of the methods described next: standards review, heuristic evaluation, design walkthroughs, screening techniques, and usability testing.

Accessibility evaluation is often limited to assessing conformance to accessibility standards. Conformance to accessibility standards is important: in some cases it's a legal requirement and in others it's just a good way to help check that you've adequately covered the range of accessibility issues. 

However, when focus is only on the technical aspects of accessibility, the human interaction aspect can be lost. In some cases where the standard was technically met by providing an alternative, the products were awkward to use or were totally unusable by some people with disabilities. These cases illustrate the importance of going beyond just meeting a minimum accessibility standard without sufficient evaluation.

For example, a [100% accessible rated site, that is completely inaccessible](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/building-the-most-inaccessible-site-possible-with-a-perfect-lighthouse-score/).

### Measuring inclusive design efforts

Designing technology using inclusive-design practices offers many beneficial outcomes. Microsoft’s Inclusive Toolkit Manual describes the following benefits of inclusive design:
* increased accessibility
* reduced friction
* greater emotional context
However, the impacts of inclusive design extend far beyond the products people use. Inclusive design also impacts mindsets, methods, and behaviors. “What we design is a byproduct of how we design. Measuring the benefits includes measuring the shift in our culture and ourselves.”

### Diversity ≠ Inclusion, Accessibility ≠ Inclusion

<blockquote>&ldquo;Diversity is about being invited to the party. <br/>
Inclusion is about being asked to dance.&rdquo;</blockquote>

But inclusion is not just a feeling, nor a static state. In an inclusive experience, everyone feels respected and valued for being who they are. Evaluate the impact of inclusive design through:
* Focus groups
* Surveys
* New analytics tools

Instead of intimidating you, I hope this information empowers you with confidence and inspiration to imagine how you might incorporate accessibility and involve diverse perspectives, including people with disabilities, throughout your project.
