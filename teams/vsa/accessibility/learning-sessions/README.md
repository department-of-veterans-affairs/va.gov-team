5. Web Performance Impact on UX & Accessibility []()<br/>
  When pages heavy with fonts, images, scripts, API calls, and ads load in web browsers, the experience can be difficult for all users; it can use up their monthly allotted data, too. For screen reader users, it's worse: visual content streams in while an auditory progress counter struggles to reach 100% so the page can be consumed. It can make it hard or impossible for assistive tech to connect to the page. This session will cover considerations, and best practices to minimize negative impact.
