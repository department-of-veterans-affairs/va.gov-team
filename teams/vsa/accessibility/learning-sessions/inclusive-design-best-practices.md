_**“Inclusion is a vast promise — as immense, in fact, as human diversity — and that’s what makes it a great design challenge. But without a clear agreement on what inclusion is, can we ever hope to achieve it? How can we design for something that means so many different things to different people?”**_ 

— Kat Holmes, author of Mismatch, How Inclusion Shapes Design

## What It Is And What It Isn’t

**Every choice we make ~~as designers~~ determines who can use an environment or product.**

Every decision we make can raise or lower barriers to participation in society. It’s our collective responsibility to lower these barriers though inclusive products, services, environments, and experiences.

The mismatches that we create in the process are the building blocks of exclusion. 

From the stairs at the entrance of a building to the two-handed design of a video game controller, our solutions clearly signal who does and doesn’t belong.

“Now we look at a small sheet of glass on a sunny day, we juggle our phones one-handed, we’re distracted or in a rush. We are, quite literally, temporarily vision, motor, hearing, and cognitively impaired on a daily basis.” - Robin Christopherson, head of digital inclusion at UK tech charity AbilityNet.

Robin pointed out that without accessibility at the very heart of everything you do, you will be producing websites and apps that leave not only disabled shoppers, but almost every one of your customers, frustrated and keen to take their money elsewhere.

**Inclusive design** focuses on the diversity of people and considers the impact on design decisions.

* Recognize exclusion
* Learn from diversity
* Solve for one, extend to many

**Inclusive design:** A design methodology that enables and draws on the full range of human diversity. Most importantly, this means including and learning from people with a range of perspectives. Designing inclusively doesn’t mean you’re making one thing for all people. You’re designing a diversity of ways for everyone to participate in an experience with a sense of belonging. Many people are unable to participate in aspects of society, both physical and digital. Understanding why and how people are excluded gives us actionable steps to take towards inclusive design.

The premise of inclusive design is that apart from permanent disabilities there are temporary, situational, or changing disabilities that affect us all. We use mobile devices in noisy environments, we struggle with screen glare in sunlight, and we attempt to tap links on touch screens that are positioned too close to each other—all of which leaves us temporarily impaired.

**Accessibility**
1. The qualities that make an experience open to all. 
2. A professional discipline aimed at achieving No. 1.

An important distinction is that accessibility is an _attribute_, while inclusive design is a _method_. And while practicing inclusive design should make your products more accessible, it’s not a process for meeting all accessibility standards. Ideally, accessibility and inclusive design work together to make experiences that are not only compliant with standards, but truly usable and open to all.

Another concept that is closely related to inclusive design is universal design.

**Universal Design** is defined as the design of an environment so that it might be accessed and used in the widest possible range of situations without the need for adaptation.

### Inclusive design — what it is & isn’t

Inclusive design, universal design, and accessibility are important for different reasons and have different strengths. 

#### Inclusive design 
* Might not lead to universal designs
* Considers situational impairments, which we all experience on a daily basis
* One-size-fits-one

#### Universal design
* Might not involve the participation of excluded communities 
* One-size-fits-all

**Accessibility** is an attribute, while Inclusive Design and Universal Design are methods. Accessible solutions aren’t always designed to consider human diversity or emotional qualities like beauty or dignity. They simply need to provide access.

Inclusive design should always start with a solid understanding of accessibility fundamentals. 

Accessibility criteria are the foundation of integrity for any inclusive solution.

Inclusive design, accessibility, and universal design are important for different reasons and have different strengths. Designers should be familiar with all three.

An inclusive designer is someone, arguably anyone, who recognizes and remedies mismatched interactions between people and their world. They seek out the expertise of people who navigate exclusionary designs. The expertise of excluded communities gives insight into a diversity of ways to participate in an experience.

## Why Inclusive Design Matters

_**Exclusion happens when we solve problems using our own biases.**_

**Recognize Exclusion** — Today when we talk about disabilities and related limitations, we include situational impairments, activity limitations, and restrictions on participation. We consider mismatches between individuals and their environments, situations, and society as a whole. [Microsoft Inclusive Design Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/)

For example: For example, a designer assumed a person who is blind wouldn’t use a photocopier. Yet, they might use a photocopier to make copies for others or to copy pages from a book in order to scan them into a speech output program.

### Recognize exclusion

Sometimes exclusion is temporary. Sometimes exclusion is situational. 

Even a short-term injury or context affects the way people interact with the world around them, if only for a short time. Think about looking into a bright light, wearing a cast, or ordering dinner in a foreign country.

As people move through different environments, their abilities can also change dramatically. In a loud crowd, they can’t hear well. In a car, they’re visually impaired. New parents spend much of their day doing tasks one-handed. An overwhelming day can cause sensory overload. What’s possible, safe, and appropriate is constantly changing.

### Recognize exclusion: Disability defined, then and now

1980 - Disability as personal attribute - “In the context of health experience, a disability is any restriction or lack of ability (resulting from an impairment) to perform an activity in the manner or within the range considered normal for a human being.”

Today - Disability as context dependent - “Disability is not just a health problem. It is a complex phenomenon, reflecting the interaction between features of a person’s body and features of the society in which [they] live.”

“The concept of "disability" may have limited the understanding of the need for accessible technology … the IT industry must consider the wide range of people who could benefit. ” - [Microsoft (2003)](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/)

One finding of Microsoft’s report [The Wide Range of Abilities and Its Impact on Computer Technology](https://download.microsoft.com/download/0/1/f/01f506eb-2d1e-42a6-bc7b-1f33d25fd40f/researchreport.doc) is that, before developers of technology products can address the growing demand for accessible products effectively, they must first acknowledge the reality that the concept of disability may have previously limited their understanding of that need.

### Recognize exclusion: Disability difficulties prevalence

A 2003 report by Microsoft revealed people struggle more than generally thought:
* 25% – Severe Difficulties
* 37% – Mild Difficulties
* 16% – Minimal Difficulties
* 21% – No difficulties

The prevalence data and definitions of difficulty levels are drawn from the [Microsoft (2003) survey.](http://www.inclusivedesigntoolkit.com/whatis/whatis.html#p20)

### Learn from Diversity

When experiences don’t serve people the way they should, people adapt. Sometimes in astonishing ways that the designers never intended. **The insight is in the adaptation.**

Interactions with technology depend heavily on what we can see, hear, say, touch, learn, and remember. Mobile tech can make situational limitations highly relevant to many people today. Mobile puts in focus questions like: Are we forced to adapt to technology, or is technology adapting to us?

_Further information:_ A report by Microsoft (2003): [The Wide Range of Abilities and its Impact on Computer Technology](http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/1/f/01f506eb-2d1e-42a6-bc7b-1f33d25fd40f/researchreport.doc) presents survey results on the range of abilities in the US population and discusses the current and potential market for accessible technology. A paper by Lange and Becerra (2007): [Teaching universal design in Colombia: the academic approach of two universities](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309800043_Teaching_Universal_Design_in_Colombia_The_Academic_Approach_of_Two_Universities) discusses perceptions of disability and explains how it is ‘normal to be different’.

**Learn how people adapt to the world by spending time understanding their experience from their perspective.**

Empathy is an important part of many different forms of design. When building empathy for exclusion and disability, it’s misleading to rely only on simulating different abilities through blindfolds and earplugs. Learning how people adapt to the world around them means spending time understanding their experience from their perspective.

### Solve for one, extend to many

Designing for people with permanent disabilities can seem like a significant constraint, but the resulting designs can actually benefit a much larger number of people. 

For example, closed captioning was created for the hard of hearing community. But, there are many benefits of captioning such as reading in a crowded airport, or, teaching children how to read.

Everyone experiences exclusion as they interact with our designs. On the other hand, a solution that works well for someone who’s blind might also benefit any person driving a car. Inclusive design works across a spectrum of related abilities, connecting different people in similar circumstances. High-contrast screen settings were initially made to benefit people with vision impairments. But today, many people benefit from high-contrast settings when they use a device in bright sunlight. The same is true for remote controls, automatic door openers, audiobooks, email, and much more. Designing with constraints in mind is simply designing well.
* One of the central ideas of inclusive design is that designing for people with disabilities will result in better designs that will benefit everyone. 
* Considering the popular technological innovations that were originally designed to help people with disabilities—email, cell phones and texting have all been developed to facilitate communication with the deaf—this is not really a radical notion. 
* What is radical is that Microsoft, a major global company, has wholeheartedly embraced the inclusive design philosophy.
* Assuming all those senses and abilities are fully enabled all the time creates the potential to ignore much of the range of humanity.

## Where You Make a Difference
_**How to weave inclusive design throughout your work**_

**Inclusive design should be a part of every stage of product development. A product created without inclusive design considerations will exclude a large audience.**

Inclusive design needs to be considered at every stage when building a product, including strategy, design, and development, highlighted Sarah Federman, a design engineer at Adobe. “At the design stage, we need to consider things like documenting expected keyboard interaction and reading order, color contrast, and text and media accessibility,” she recommended. “Project managers need to be tracking this and developers need to know how their app should behave—not just how it looks. It's a shared responsibility across the entire organization.”

Sarah also emphasized that none of the work done at any stage matters if it doesn’t make it out the door. If you do an amazing job documenting keyboard accessibility but a developer never sees it or it was implemented incorrectly, your work ends up having little value for your end users. Communication and follow-through is really key to delivering a great inclusive experience.

A [recent survey of Facebook users](https://www.facebook.com/accessibility/posts/1773602802683437?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAIlOXGgTDDs0qFETjvLFdzo39MBOw9Axr9wFIUM8XiCRHbsQrfmgvMkoI8JodQVvIdWlMyvmihWqhRBgCUhb9ir2L98JpmDrWSCh3qlIaxGLjYxbL2tqb25GCozidpriZE0IF8Dw4GDj99C0d7fztDwBAEwONdjX1_08DH106aeFZiYlOt_yOTuv233MKCIUUcZVJQ4vA9djarGGYv1bqx304uRHqTUPuB7oWOBJzqxN_aGPYFhRV0kn5_VfqOQfpxAHG81-VtheEf8GKhPyXmyJU050XNd8Uf9yyWJ4dAspi0O3e3V6_07D_7Fzx6gCD67xofbWJjVBtEIN5TV-p-hA&__tn__=-R) in 50 countries found that more than 30 percent of people report difficulty with at least one of the following: seeing, hearing, speaking, organizing thoughts, walking, or grasping with their hands. [Facebook Accessibility - May 17, 2018] Worse still, non-inclusive content and experiences will push people away. And it’s not always easy to pinpoint when that’s happening. Excluded web visitors often don’t complain: 71 percent will just leave. Ensuring experiences are accessible means recognizing exclusion, learning from your audience, and presenting information in the clearest ways possible. 

### Start with accessibility

Incorporating accessibility early…
* _decreases_ the time and expense to design accessible products
* _increases_ the overall positive impact accessibility can have

It can be very costly to make required design changes if accessibility is only addressed late in product design and development.

### Accessibility at the end incurs problems

Accessibility “bolted on” at the end is usually much less effective for people with disabilities, and less beneficial for others. For example,
* A building architecturally planned for accessibility from the beginning may include a wheelchair-accessible entrance that elegantly and practically fits the aesthetic, _versus…_
* A building with a ramp added on after the building was designed, and the doorways modified after it was built to accommodate necessary width for a wheelchair and service dog scenario.

This relates to digital design, as well, impacting systems architecture, personas, user journeys, design systems, page templates, information architecture, and semantic markup. Not only is it expensive to re-architect these systems, it is complicated, time-consuming, and introduces risk.

**The best way to understand the diverse range of people you want to serve is to _work with them_ and learn how they interact with the world around them.**

### Include people with disabilities

It may seem daunting to include people with disabilities on your project team. While it may not be feasible in all cases, if you can, you will gain great return on your investment, including:
* **Motivation** — When designers, managers, and other stakeholders see people with disabilities using their product, most are inspired with a new understanding of the impact of accessibility issues.
* **Efficiency** — Including users with disabilities early in a project helps the team more efficiently address accessibility. This maximizes results from the investment as they more quickly develop accessible solutions, spend less time guessing, and avoid having to fix problems afterwards.
* **Effectiveness** — When a team understands issues, they implement more effective, accessible solutions.

**Evaluate data. It’s only as good as those collecting and assessing it. Diverse teams are crucial in this.**

“Data isn’t a be-all end-all,” warned Ivana McConnell, senior UI/UX designer at Customer.io. “When making decisions based on data, remember that data is only as good as those collecting it and asking questions of it. Diverse teams, built with inclusive hiring practices, are imperative. They bring the viewpoints which help keep data accountable, and ask the right questions of that data. Numbers are only as neutral as the people using them.”

### Accessibility considerations at the start:

- [ ] Research requirements and standards for your products – accessibility, legal, etc.
- [ ] Establish internal policies and guidelines for accessibility and inclusion
- [ ] Plan, budget, and schedule to include a diverse range of people, including those with disabilities, as project co-creators and on your teams
- [ ] Steward inclusive design and accessibility expertise through training and hiring
- [ ] Instead of evaluating accessibility separately, integrate checks where they fit best within your current reviews, testing, and quality assurance (QA)
- [ ] Business and usability goals include accessibility requirements

**“Designing for inclusion is not a feel-good sideline.… inclusion can be a source of innovation and growth, especially for digital technologies. It can be a catalyst for creativity and a boost for the bottom line as a customer base expands. And each time we remedy a mismatched interaction, we create an opportunity for more people to contribute to society in meaningful ways.”**
— John Maeda, in the forward to Kat Holmes’ Mismatch, How Inclusion Shapes Design

### Individual differences

Be careful not to assume that feedback from one person with a disability applies to all people with disabilities. 

People with disabilities are as varied as any users; they come from a variety of backgrounds and have varied interests, likes and dislikes, goals and skills. They have different experiences, different expectations, and different preferences. They use different interaction techniques, different adaptive strategies, and different assistive technology configurations.

A person with a disability doesn't necessarily know how other people with the same disability interact with products, nor know enough about other disabilities to provide valid guidance on other accessibility issues. Just as you would not make design decisions based on feedback from just one user, don't make accessibility decisions based only on the recommendations of one person with a disability. What works for one person might not work for everyone with that disability or for people with other disabilities.

### Set usability goals

Most usability goals should be the same for all users, regardless of disability. 

Usability goals or usability objectives are targets for product usability that are defined in the Analysis Phase and usually measured with usability testing. Usability goals include measurable behavior and specific criteria, such as time-on-task, number of errors, and completion or success rate. 

### First time use versus familiar use

Many usability goals and usability tests focus on new product users; time-on-task for first time use. Such usability goals might be different for some users with disabilities, because in some cases a user with a disability might be slower the first time they use a new product, yet after becoming familiar with the product they may complete tasks just as fast or faster than a user without a disability.

For frequently-used products and tasks, you might decide that efficient first time use is not as important, and thus modify your usability goal to focus on time-on-task once a user is familiar with the product. For example, you might change a usability goal from “the first time the user uses the product”, to “after the user has used the product for two days”.

### Usability goals for critical & non-critical tasks

While there may be relaxed usability goals for certain tasks under some circumstances, it is important critical tasks be completed as efficiently and effectively by people with disabilities. When considering acceptable modifications of usability goals consider the importance and frequency of the task. Consider if the task is:

* Core, primary functionality
* Supplemental, secondary functionality
* Frequent maintenance, such as changing a battery
* Initial set up and installation
* Periodic maintenance and repair

For core, primary functionality it is usually important people with disabilities can meet the same usability goals; whereas, for periodic maintenance and repair it may not be important. Source: [http://uiaccess.com/accessucd/analysis.html](http://uiaccess.com/accessucd/analysis.html)

### User analysis

Product design that considers the needs of people with disabilities is still relatively uncommon. As a result, the range of users who can use products and the situations in which products can be used is less inclusive than if the needs of people with a wider range of abilities and disabilities were considered in design.

* Include accessibility considerations in user group profiles and personas. People with disabilities are potentially members of all user groups, accessibility considerations apply to all user group profiles. 
* Don’t make assumptions about tools and services people with disabilities might use. For example, a designer assumed a person who is blind wouldn’t use a photocopier. Yet, they might use a photocopier to make copies for others or to copy pages from a book in order to scan them into a speech output program.

Another example: A usability testing participant with low vision remarked when he was frustrated by inaccessible websites when he was comparing auto insurance rates for his wife's car and he said, "as though a person who doesn't drive would not be buying auto insurance."
