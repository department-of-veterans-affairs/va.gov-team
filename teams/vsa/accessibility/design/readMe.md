# Accessibility Guidance for Design

1. Define how to help teams develop empathy for the diverse range of users, such as race, socio-economics, technology challenged, and people with disabilities.

1. Document interaction behavior, and ensure it is accessible.

1. Define criteria to evaluate the accessibility of designs, such as mobile-first, defining states, heading order, and focus management.

1. Annotate semantic markup, reading order, focus management in designs to ensure development understands the fully designed experience.

1. Use inclusive, accessible prototyping tools, such as Adobe XD and coded prototypes.

More to come.
