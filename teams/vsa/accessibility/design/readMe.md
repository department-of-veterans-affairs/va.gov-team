# Accessibility Guidance for Design

1. Define how to help teams develop empathy for the diverse range of users (such as race, socio-economics, technology challenged, and people with disabilities).

1. Document interaction behavior, and ensure it is accessible.

1. Define criteria to evaluate the accessibility of designs, such as mobile-first, defining states, heading order, focus management.

1. Use inclusive, accessible prototyping tools, such as Adobe XD and coded prototypes, to meet participants where they are, empowering them to use their own devices the way they normally would.
