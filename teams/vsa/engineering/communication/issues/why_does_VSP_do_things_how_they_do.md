One of the topics that VSA engineers specifically asked to be addressed in our efforts to improve communication is -

`Why does VSP do things the way they do? They seem to home roll almost everything, why is this?`

Almost every solution that VSP comes up with to problems are `home rolled`, VSA engineers want to know why this is. We would like to have a public place where we can see why VSP made a decision that they did.

As a side note VSA engineers would also like to be included in the decision making process for solutions that will affect VSA engineers.

This document will provide a repository for anything surfaced throughout the improvement project on this question.
