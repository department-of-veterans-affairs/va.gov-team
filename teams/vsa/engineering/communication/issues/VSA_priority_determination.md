One of the issues that VSA engineers would like addressed during the communication improvement project is -

`How does VSP determine priorities? Can we have the current priorities more clearly communicated as well as why they are the way they are?`

Currently we do not have any transparancy into how VSP is determining what their priorities are. This causes issues when VSA engineers hear from VSP that something is a high pirority but then is not treated as such and we have no understanding of why that is.

We also do not have a clear and public location where VSP's current priorities are displayed so we have no transparancy as to where VSA priorities fall in regards to other work VSP is working on.
