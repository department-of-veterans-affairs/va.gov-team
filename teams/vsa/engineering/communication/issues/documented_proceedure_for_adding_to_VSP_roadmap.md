One of the topics that VSA engineers specifically asked to be addressed in our efforts to improve communication is -

`A clearly documented proceedure of getting work on VSP's roadmap`

There is no place where VSA engineers have been given a clear proceedure for getting items added to VSP's roadmap, this leads to a lot of wasted time with VSA engineers trying to get things added using whatever communication protocol they are most used to.

This document will provide a repository for anything surfaced throughout the improvement project on this question.
