One of the topics that VSA engineers specifically asked to be addressed in our efforts to improve communication is -

`What happened to the ticketing system that VSP was working on?`

At one point VSP mentioned that they were going to impliment a ticketing system but VSA engineers never heard anything else about this. We have seen a Slackbot create tickets in the #vfs-platform-support channel but there have been no discussions or guidance as to what these tickets are for, who is responsible for them, or what the expectations should be around them.
