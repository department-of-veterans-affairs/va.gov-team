One of the topics that VSA engineers specifically asked to be addressed in our efforts to improve communication is -

`What happened to the ticketing system that VSP was working on?`

At one point VSP mentioned that they were going to impliment a ticketing system but VSA engineers never heard anything else about this. We have seen a Slackbot create tickets in the #vfs-platform-support channel but there have been no discussions or guidance as to what these tickets are for, who is responsible for them, or what the expectations should be around them.

This document will provide a repository for anything surfaced throughout the improvement project on this question.
