One of the topics that VSA engineers specifically asked to be addressed in our efforts to improve communication is -

`What is the scope of responsibility for VSP?`

There is no place were specific responsibilities for VSP are spelled out, there is very vague descirptions in the VSP Github repo for their mission but there is no place that very simply spells out what they are responsible for and what they are not responsible for.

VSA engineers need to have the specific responsibilities of VSP clearly spelled out, there are times when there are misunderstandings about what should be brought to VSP and what should not.

This document will provide a repository for anything surfaced throughout the improvement project on this question.
