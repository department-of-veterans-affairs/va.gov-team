# VSA Communication protocol

The VSA organization laregely does not have a communication protocol defined, we currently use Slack for most communication within and between teams.

There is currently an initiative to improve the communication protocol in and amongst VSA and VSP [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/engineering/communication/plan_to_improve.md) which will be ongoing.
