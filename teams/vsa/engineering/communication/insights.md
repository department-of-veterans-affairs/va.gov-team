# Background
In order to assess the pain points that VSA engineers encounter when communicating with VSP we interviewed all engineers on the VSA program to gather feedback. This feedback was organized and insights pulled from it, here are those insights.

## Areas of communication
There are two main areas of communication for VSA engineers; long term communication and daily communication. Each of these two areas are broken down below.

### Long term communication
This is communication around longer term efforts by VSP, such as fixes to the build system, or large initiatives such as the Expirimental Design System. The major gaps in this long term communication fit into two categories; communcation at the beginning of the initiative and communication during or near the the end of the initiative -

#### At the beginning of the initiative 
1. There is not enough communication before a large initiative is undertaken where VSP defines a clear problem statement then involves VSA in the selection of a solution. This leads to solutions that solve a symptom of a problem, not the root problem itself. A perfect example of this is the expirimental design system, which solves a symptom of a problem but not the root problem.
2. There is not enough transparency around the current priorities of VSP. There is also no clear reason provided for the discrepancy between VSP and VSA priorities.

#### During the initiative or near the end
1. VSA engineers are not consulted on the release or announcement of a larger initiative. The current communication generally takes place over Slack and it missed. This causes major time losses and a critical loss of trust in VSP. 
2. Currently there is no well understood strategy about the creation or dissemination of documentation. We currently seem to have 4 different sources of documentation that we are reffered to; design.va.gov, storybook, the client documentation, and the codebase. We don't know which is the source of truth for any one thing and navigating these separately is fraught with nuance.


### Short term communication
This is communication that takes place on a daily basis, generally over Slack. The majority of this communication is around troubleswhooting local workstation issues that come up during the course of a workday for VSA engineers, though some of this communication is also around issues in staging or production. The biggest gaps in short term communication are - 

1. No clear escalation paths. When you have an issue, wether it be on your local machine or otherwise, there is no clear path to take with that issue. This ends up making #vsp-platform-support a catch-all and issues either get routed inefficiently or not at all.
2. No clear expectations around Slack communication. When posting in #vsp-platform-support there is no common understanding as to the level of service you will get, when to expect a reply, the correctness of the reply, or what you can do past this initial communication.
3. no clear expectations around the creation or management of tickets. When VSA engineers are asked to create a ticket pertaining to their issue there are no expectations provided around anything with that ticket such as who they should tag, who will answer, when will they answer, will the answer be correct, etc.
