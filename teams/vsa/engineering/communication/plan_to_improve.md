# Plan to improve communication between VSA and VSP

## The Problem 

The working relationship between VSA and VSP is not as optimal as it could be. From the VSA side there are limited methods to reach out to VSP and those methods are often full of gaps that create doubt, contention, and at times result in wasted time and mistakes. From the VSP side there is difficulty to organize communication in a fashion that allows VSP engineers to focus on tasks. We need a better set of “rules of engagement” that are crystal clear to both parties and are well documented in a public space so there is no confusion on either side about how communication should take place and what the expectations of that communication should be.


> The process to improve communication between VSA and VSP will take roughly 4 phases -
- Feedback will be personally taken from VSA engineers as to how communication exists currently and what the biggest pain points are.
- Feedback will be personally taken from VSP engineers on how communication exists currently and what the biggest pain points are.
- Feedback will be correlated to look for common patterns and solutions will be developed with input from both VSA and VSP engineers.
- A “rules of engagement” document will be publicly documented and shared with both VSA and VSP.

## Phase 1 - Meet with VSA engineers

> Goal: We want to hear first hand what the current state of communication is from a VSA engineer’s perspective. We want to truly understand what the pain points are and how those pain points affect VSA engineers on a daily basis. Feedback from these conversations will be collected in a public document and shared with the organization.

Specific issues VSA engineers want addressed
- What happened to the ticketing system that VSP was working on?
- What is the scope of responsibilities of VSP?
- Can we have a documented process of getting work on VSP's roadmap?
- How does VSP determine priorities? Can we have the current priorities more clearly communicated as well as why they are the way they are?
- Why does VSP do things the way they do? They seem to home roll almost everything, why is this?
- How can we make VSA and VSP move together as one cohesive team?

It was determined in the VSA engineering meeting on May 25th that they want to be met with on a sprint team by sprint team basis to give feedback on the current state of communication.
We will create a schedule of meetings as well as document findings from those meetings.

## Phase 2 - Meet with VSP engineers

> Goal: We want to hear first hand what the current state of communication is from a VSP engineer’s perspective. We want to truly understand what the pain points are and how those pain points affect VSP engineers on a daily basis stemming from communication. Feedback from these conversations will be collected in a public document and shared with the organization.

We will meet with VSP engineering as a whole to pitch this idea and asses how they would like this feedback to be gathered from them, wether by 1 on 1s with each engineer, meeting with sprint teams individually, or meeting with the full group.

## Phase 3 -  Correlate feedback and develop solutions

> Goal: To create a “rules of engagement” between VSA and VSP we need to take a deep look into the pain points that are facing both teams in regards to communication.  Our bet here is that there are common pain points not only within the VSA and VSP cohorts but also between the two cohorts, respectively. Once we fully understand the pain points we can create a plan for communication that seeks to alleviate these. This will be treated as an MVP and will be iterated on as we gather ongoing feedback.

> Deliverable: a “rules of engagement” document first draft. This first draft will be reviewed by both VSA and VSP to ensure it solves the pain points discussed in earlier phases.

> Once we have a document spelling out the rules of engagement we will seek review from both the VSA engineers and the VSP engineers to ensure it solves the issues we discussed in earlier phases.


## Phase 3 - Distribute

> Goal: To ensure everyone on both the VSA and VSP engineering teams has a clear understanding of what methods of communication should be used and what the expectations are for those methods of communication. Thes rules need to be distributed and available in a public place where everyone knows where it is and everyone can see it.
