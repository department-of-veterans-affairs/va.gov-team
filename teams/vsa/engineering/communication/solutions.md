# Background
Now that we have done initial research into the pain points surrounding communication between VSA and VSP we have developed a few potential solutions to address the pain points. This document details the potential solutions. Each solution will begin with the initial root cause, followed by a description of the pain point, then the insights that were provided by our research. Then the potential solution will be detailed.

## Root Cause - Lack of a clear problem statement

> There is not enough communication before a large initiative is undertaken where VSP defines a clear problem statement then involves VSA in the clarifying of that problem statement or the selection of a 
> solution. This leads to solutions that solve a symptom of a problem, not the root problem itself. A perfect example of this is the expirimental design system,  which solves a symptom of a problem but not the root problem.`

**Insights**
- "VSP always seem to choose a nuclear option without explanation of what the problem they are trying to solve or why they chose this particular solution"
- "Many solutions seem to be knee-jerk reactions"

Solution
<hr>
An asyncronous document or a meeting should be provided before a VSP project starts where VSP clearly presents the problem, not the solution, and then are able to ask VSA engineers questions about the nature of the problem. This will also be a time for VSA engineers to explore the problem and potential solutions before both VSP and VSA choose a potential solution together. This meeting or document should be collaberative workshop, not a presentation, that is provided in a very public forum and everyone has the ability to ask questions and provide input.


## Root Cause - Lack of transparancy

> There is not enough transparency around the current priorities of VSP. There is also no clear reason provided for the discrepancy between VSP and VSA priorities.

**Insights**
- "I think (The priority) is to keep the lights on but I don’t know other than that
- "It's pretty opaque"

Solution 
<hr>


## Root Cause - Lack of a coherant rollout plan

> VSA engineers are not consulted on the announcement or release  of a larger initiative. The current communication generally takes place over Slack and it is missed. This causes major time losses and a critical loss of trust in VSP.

**Insights**
- "Alert Boxes getting deprecated are a good example, instead of blocking people from merging have the linter show a warning until people get used to them being deprecated and then block them from being merged"
- "Typically VSP struggles with rolling things out, it would be better if they have phased rollouts instead of all at once"
- "when we use the solution it is just rolled out like 'here you go' and we can’t do anything about it and we get completely blocked"

Solution
<hr>
A meeting or document designated for VSA engineers to detail how a solution should be rolled out. A set of guidelines should also be created with guidelines for progressive rollouts on VSP projects. VSP projects also should be required to be progressively rolled out.
