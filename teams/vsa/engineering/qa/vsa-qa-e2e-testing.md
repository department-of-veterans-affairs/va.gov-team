# VSA-QA End-to-end testing

**[Work In Progress]**

End-to-end (E2E) testing on VA.gov specifically means automated browser testing.  Although not technically integration testing, browser testing does qualify as E2E -- it can reveal faults anywhere along the browser-database integration, not just the front-end.  While front-end issues are the most obvious, symptoms of some backend issues are also detectable in browser testing (e.g., missing data or page not loading).

## Brand-new to E2E testing?

### VSP basic documentation

If you're brand-new to E2E testing, be sure to read [VSP's basic End-to-end testing docs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/testing/end-to-end).  This VSA-specific documentation here _supplements_ that information.
