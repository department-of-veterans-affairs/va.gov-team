# TestRail Reports Generation Tracking

This doc tracks Reports generation in TestRail.  TestRail Cloud instances have been exhibiting issues with Reports taking a long time to generate or simply erroring-out.  We hope to help TR fix the issue by providing specific feedback/data.

Platform QA Standards Team has reported this issue to TestRail, and is monitoring progress in [#41739](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/41739).
