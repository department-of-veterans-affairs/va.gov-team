# VSA-QA Tasks & Capacity

Currently, with only one VSA-QA resource shared across all VSA Product Teams, capacity limitations preclude VSA-QA from handling all the QA tasks outlined by VSP.

## Who should read this?

- Product Managers

The matrix below illustrates the current reality of what VSA-QA can realistically perform, and what VSA Product Teams need to perform themselves:

| QA Task | VSA-QA | VSA Product Teams |
| ------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| [Manual testing](vsa-qa-process.md) | :heavy_check_mark: | |
| Unit testing | | :heavy_check_mark: |
| [E2E testing](vsa-qa-e2e-testing.md) (incl. [Regression](vsa-qa-regression.md)) | | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Load testing | | :heavy_check_mark: |

This matrix will be updated if/when VSA-QA staffing increases.
