## What is a TestRail Project?

A Project is TestRail's main organizational unit. All data like Test Cases, Test Runs, Test Results/Reports, and Test Plans are directly associated with a Project.

**NOTE**: Your Application Team should already have its Project created in TestRail. If your Team's newly-formed, your Product Manager should contact #.

TestRail Projects are used to reflect PTEMS VA.gov Application Teams organization -- each Application Team has its own Project [except Account Experience's VA.gov Profile & My VA teams who share a single project]. All test-data &mdash; test-cases, test-plans, test-runs, etc. &mdash; for a Team's products/features are housed inside the Team's TestRail Project. Typically, you can only access your own Team's Project with your Team's login credentials.

## How do I access my team's TestRail Project?

1. Get your team's shared login credentials from your Product Manager.
