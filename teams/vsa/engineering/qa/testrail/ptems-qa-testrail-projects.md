# TestRail Projects

**[WORK IN PROGRESS]**

## What is a Project?

A Project is TestRail's main organizational unit.  All data like Test Cases, Test Runs, and Test Plans are directly associated with a Project.

**NOTE**: Your VSA Product Team should already have its Project created in TestRail, unless your Team's newly-formed (in which case your Product Manager should consult [Platform's Getting started with TestRail doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/b352dd50dfb8064f0cf813bae1d20cf755cfc1d7/platform/quality-assurance/testrail/getting-started.md)).

## How are Projects used for PTEMS?

Projects are used to reflect PTEMS VA.gov Application Teams organization -- each Application Team has its own Project.  All test-data for a Team's products/features are housed inside the Team's Project.  Typically, you can only access your own Team's Project with your Team's login credentials.

## How do I access my Project in TestRail?

After logging into TR, you'll be on the Dashboard, where all Projects are listed.  All PTEMS-Product-Team Project-names start with **PTEMS-** (e.g., **PTEMS-1010**, **VSA-Authd-Exp*, etc.) -- just click the Project with your Team-name to access your team-specific Test Plans/Runs/Cases.

## Usage Tips

### Favorite your Project

You can have your Project displayed at the top of the Projects list on your Dashboard by making it a Favorite:

- Click the **empty star** icon next to the Project-name.  The icon will change to a filled-in, yellow star, and the Project will be displayed at the top of the list.
