## What is a TestRail Project?

A Project is TestRail's main organizational unit.  All data like Test Cases, Test Runs, Test Results/Reports, and Test Plans are directly associated with a Project.

**NOTE**: Your Application Team should already have its Project created in TestRail.  If your Team's newly-formed, your Product Manager should contact #.

TestRail Projects are used to reflect PTEMS VA.gov Application Teams organization -- each Application Team has its own Project [except VA-Profile team which shares a Project with Authenticated-Experience team].  All test-data for a Team's products/features are housed inside the Team's TestRail Project.  Typically, you can only access your own Team's Project with your Team's login credentials.

## How do I access my team's TestRail Project?
