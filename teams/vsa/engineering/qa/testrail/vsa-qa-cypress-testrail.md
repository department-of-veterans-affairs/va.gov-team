# VSA-QA Cypress-TestRail integration

## Who should read this?

- VSA F/E Engineers

## What is this?

A simple set of custom configuration and script files for reporting vets-website's **[Cypress E2E][vsp-e2e-testing]** test results to our **[TestRail][vsp-testrail]** test case management system (TCMS).

This integration leverages Vivify Ideas' **[cypress-testrail-reporter][cy-tr-reporter]** Node-package to post a Cypress spec-file's test-results to an automatically-created TestRail test-run.

The cypress-testrail-reporter makes some assumptions about your E2E files and TestRail test-cases:
- **One TestRail test-case Section for each Cypress spec-file**: If you have 3 E2E spec-files, you should have 3 TestRail test-case Sections (aka Groups).
- **One TestRail test-run for each Cypress spec-file**: If you run 3 Cypress spec-files, you'll end up with 3 separate TestRail test-runs.

This might not be a perfect fit with our existing spec-files organization or reporting needs, and your feedback is strongly encouraged - use #vsp-platform-support Slack-channel.

## How do I do this?

### Start with VSP-QA basic process

First, read **[VSP-QA's basic process][vsp-cy-tr-reporter]** to get a general idea.  Then, read the VSA-QA help/tips below for more details.

### Continue with VSA-QA help/tips

Additional help info is provided below, to flesh-out the basic process.

#### TestRail API Key

- To log in to our [TestRail](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/) TCMS, first obtain your Team's credentials from your Product Manager.
- To quickly to to your Team's TestRail Project, check the table in the next section.
- Then just follow [VSP-QA procedure](/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/quality-assurance/e2e-testing/cypress-testrail-reporter-config.md#testrail-api-key) to generate your API Key.

#### Corresponding TestRail Objects

##### Project & Suite IDs

Instead of checking TestRail URLs to obtain your team's Project & Suite IDs (2 key environment variables you'd need to set), just refer to the table below:
  
| VSA Product Team  | TestRail Project Name/Link | TestRail Project ID | TestRail Suite ID |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Authenticated Experience | [VSA-Authd-Exp][authd-exp-tr-proj]  | 4  | 5 |
| Claims & Appeals | [VSA-Claims-Appeals][claims-tr-proj]  | 5  | 6 |
| Caregiver | [VSA-Caregiver][caregiver-tr-proj] | 10  | 11 |
| Content & Localization | [VSA-Content-Localization][content-loc-tr-proj] | 34  | 183 |
| Debt Resolution | [VSA-Debt-Resolution][debt-tr-proj]  | 7  | 8 |
| Decision Tools  | [VSA-Decision-Tools][dcsn-tools-tr-proj] | 30 | 136 |
| eBenefits Migration | [VSA-eBenefits][eben-tr-proj] | 3 | 3 |
| Facilities | [VSA-Facilities][fac-tr-proj] | 6 | 7 |
| Healthcare Experience [aka Clipboard] | [VSA-Healthcare-Exp][healthcare-tr-proj] | 24 | 35 |
| Public Websites | [VSA-Public-Websites][pubweb-tr-proj] | 8 | 9 |
| Search & Discovery | [VSA-Search-Discovery][search-tr-proj] | 31 | 150 |
| VAMC | [VSA-VAMC][vamc-tr-proj] | 9 | 10 |


##### Scaffold your TestRail Test Cases

1. Go to your **TestRail Project**, then click **TEST CASES** tab.  The Test Cases screen has 3 panels:
    - **Test Cases** [left]: Test-cases list.
    - **Selected Test Case** [middle]: Details of a selected test-case (highlighted in the Test Cases panel).
    - **Sections** [right]: Test-cases sections (aka Groups) for organizing test-cases.
1. In **Sections** panel, Add a **Section** for each Cypress spec-file:
    - If you don't see an existing root-level Section for your Product (application), create a root-level Section for it.
    - If you don't see an existing Sub-section for Automated tests, create one [Add a Section, then drag to Move it into the Product Section].
    - Under your Product > Automated section, Add a Section for your Cypress spec-file.
    - In the **Test Cases** panel, under your Cypress-spec-file Section, Add a Test Case for each test (`it('...', () => {...})`) in your Cypress spec-file.

#### TestRail Group IDs

Another environment variable you'd need to set is your TestRail test cases' Group IDs (which enables filtering of your test cases).  Because of how our TestRail test cases are organized/displayed, there's a "trick" to finding the relevant ID(s) for your planned Cypress test runs.

1. Go to your Team's TestRail Project. [Click a project-link in **[Project & Suite IDs](#project--suite-ids)** section's table above].
1. In the **Sections** panel:
    - Click the **View Mode** dropdown-menu and choose **Selected group only**.
    
    ![testrail-test-cases-view-mode][testrail-test-cases-view-mode]
    
    - Click to select the desired **Group/Section**.  On the **Test Cases** panel, you'll see only this selected Group/Section's Test Cases.
1. Click **TEST CASES** tab to go to your Project's test-cases screen.
1. Within **Automated** Sub-section, create Test Cases corresponding to your product's E2E tests, one Case for each test (`it('...', () => {...})`) within each .cypress.spec.js file, setting it's Type to **Automated**. No need to create any Steps inside the Case -- these Cases are merely TestRail "stubs" for associating your E2E test results.
</details>

#### 4. Prepend Case IDs to E2E test titles

For each .cypress.spec.js file, prepend the TestRail Test Case's IDs to the start of your E2E test titles.

1. In your code-editor, open your .cypress.spec.js file.
2. At the beginning of each test-title (`it('my-test-title', () => {})`), type **C**, and then the **ID** of the corresponding TestRail Test Case you scaffolded.  E.g., your Cypress test title `it('renders Learn More link', () => {...})` has a corresponding TestRail test case with ID 1059, so prepend "C1059 " to your Cypress test title -- `it('C0159 renders Learn More link'), () => {...})` 

#### 5. Set Environment Variables & invoke Cypress

##### Test Run names

Test Run name is another environment variable you'd need to set, in order to distinguish different spec-files' test-runs.  Be sure to set your name-string as follows:

- No quotes - do not use quotes to enclose the string
- No spaces - use hyphens or underscores instead to separate words.

##### Filter cases

Be sure to filter your test-cases (set TR_INCLUDE_ALL to false).  Your TestRail project/suite also includes manual test-cases that need to be excluded from your test-runs.

##### Follow VSP's prodecure to complete test-run calls

Now, just follow VSP's instructions to [set environment variables][vsp-cy-tr-env-vars] & [invoke Cypress with custom reporter options][vsp-cy-tr-optns].

The end result is a new TestRail Test Run in your Team's TestRail project, with pass/fail results of the linked Test Cases corresponding to your Cypress test results.
