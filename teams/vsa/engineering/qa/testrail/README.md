## Who should read this?

- QA Engineer
- Anyone "deputized" to create Test Plan/Runs/Cases in TestRail.

## What is TestRail (TR)?

TestRail (TR) is the test case management system (TCMS).  It's our VA.gov system-of-record for test planning, test cases development/maintenace, and test-results reporting.  Platform's vision for TR is a one-stop-shop for documentating all things testing.  Currently, it's used mostly for manual-UI testing, but going forward we're intending it to also support automated testing as well.

## Who uses TestRail?

- **PTEMS-QA**: Most of the time, QA is the main user of TR.  That said, however, staffing/capacity limitations prevent PTEMS-QA from supporting all testing needs of PTEMS Product Teams all the time.
- **PTEMS Product Managers**: PMs regularly access TR to check test results/reports, especially in prep for Platform Staging Reviews.  Occasionally, when PTEMS-QA's overbooked, PMs may need to "deputize" themselves to create/schedule Test Plans/Runs/Cases/Reports directly in TR.
- **PTEMS Designers/Engineers**: Access TR as/when needed to validate Test Case steps created by PTEMS-QA.  Occasionally, if deputized, also create and/or run the test-cases there.

## Brand-new to TestRail?

### Platform's basic documentation

If you're brand-new to TR, be sure to read [Platform's basic documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/ca2514e624dcf5b245cf662f17839c6c5cee69f0/platform/quality-assurance/testrail/README.md) first!  The PTEMS-specific documentation here _supplements_ that documentation, and assumes you have some basic TestRail knowledge.

#### Existing PTEMS Teams

Existing PTEMS Application Teams should already have TestRail access (ask your Product Manager) and a team-specific TestRail Project.  Unless your PTEMS Team's brand-new, you can skip Platform's Getting Started topics for requesting access and creating a project.
