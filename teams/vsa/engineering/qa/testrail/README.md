# TestRail help

**NOTE**: Supplements Platform TestRail documentation -- This VSA-specific documentation supplments VSP's basic [How to use TestRail](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/quality-assurance/testrail) documentation.  It does NOT replace that, but rather adds information specific to VSA's TestRail usage.

## Brand-new to TestRail?

If you're brand-new to TestRail, be sure to read VSP's basic documentation first! [See NOTE & link above.]  The VSA-specific documentation here assumes you have some basic TestRail knowledge.
