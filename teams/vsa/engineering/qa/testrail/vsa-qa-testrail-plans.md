# TestRail Test Plans

**[Work In Progress]**

## Getting started

### VSP basic procedure

The basic procedure for creating a Test Plan in TestRail is shown in [VSP's Create a Test Plan video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v5KIR3KJHkypfm7QJje0O7xo6aEtcCaC/view). That video shows you how to create an empty Test Plan.

## Usage Tips

A Test Plan can house 2 or more related Test Runs.  There's often a need to re-run some tests on the same product/feature.  Instead of filling out the same info every time you create a repeat Test Run, create a Test Plan to document the common info, then just Add a new Run to the Plan.

### Add related Test Runs

When you creating/editing a Test Plan, click **Add Test Run(s)** at the top of the right panel.  TestRail will add a Test Run on the left panel, below your Plan's Description field, ready for you to rename, select Test Cases, and assign.  No need to input Description/References unless this info differs from the Plan's Description.
