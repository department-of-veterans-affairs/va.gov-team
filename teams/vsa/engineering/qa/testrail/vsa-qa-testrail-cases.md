# TestRail Test Cases

**NOTE**: Supplements Platform TestRail documentation -- This VSA-specific documentation supplments VSP's basic [How to use TestRail](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/quality-assurance/testrail) documentation.  It does NOT replace that, but rather adds information specific to VSA's TestRail usage.

[See also [VSA-QA Test Cases](../vsa-qa-test-cases.md) for general test-case info and best practices.]
