## What is End-to-end (e2e) testing?

End-to-end (e2e) testing on VA.gov specifically means automated browser testing.  Although not technically integration testing, browser testing does qualify as E2E -- it can reveal faults anywhere along the browser-database integration, not just the front-end.  While front-end issues are the most obvious, symptoms of some backend issues are also detectable in browser testing (e.g., missing data or page not loading).

## Who writes e2e tests?

**Front-end engineers** write e2e tests during development.

## Brand-new to e2e testing?

### Platform's basic documentation

If you're brand-new to E2E testing, be sure to read [Platform's basic End-to-end testing][platform-e2e] docs.  This Shared-Support-specific documentation here _supplements_ that information.

### Regression testing

Currently, regression testing is implicitly handled using the automated unit and e2e tests that are maintained as part of development work.  Going forward, Platform-QA may formally require regression-test reports for Midpoint and Staging Reviews.


## Shared-Support-specific help

While e2e tests are regularly reviewed by code-reviewers in pull-requests, Shared-Support-QA will also help validate & improve the tests as capacity allows.  Anytime you have a question/issue coding e2e tests, feel free to reach out to Shared-Support-QA for guidance.
