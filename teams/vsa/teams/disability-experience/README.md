## General team overview

## Team charter
At the highest level, the core disability experience team is here to own, from the ground up, the online submission experience for Veteran disability compensation claims and to make that experience as fast and easy as possible to complete, while ensuring submissions are timely, accurate, and in a state that allow VSR and RVSRS (the people who review and rate claims) to rate them quickly and easily!
