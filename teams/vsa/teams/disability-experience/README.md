## Team charter
The disability crew maintains and improves the application for disability compensation on va.gov (Form 21-526EZ).Through this benefit, Veterans can receive monthly pay for injuries and illnesses that are a result of their service.
We also are responsible for features nested within the disability form, including 

* Auto-setting an Intent to File, locking in a potential backpay date
* A slightly different version of the form for applicants transitioning out of the military who are eligible for the Benefits Disability at Discharge program (BDD)
* Suggesting a set of conditions (called "contentions") Veterans can claim, and then applying a topical classification to each condition (this team organizes primarily in #benefits-contention-classification channel)
* Uploading files/evidence provided by the Veteran along with the application form
* A form to request that VA retrieve private medical records (21-4142) 
* A form to report mental health conditions such as PTSD (21-0781)
