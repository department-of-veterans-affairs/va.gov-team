### Date: Dec 14' 2023       
### Participants: Rakshinda, Austin, Emily, Shannon 
### Topics Covered:

- 4142 Failures
  - Approach to determine following?:
    - "We may want them to actually go both places -- to the efolder AND to central mail. But we'll need to confirm the desired behavior with 
      david and possibly OBI (office of business integration, who owns the mail portal and mail automation) before implementing."
      **Notes:**
      - VBA uses a contractor to reach out for private medical records(PMR)
      - There is currently automation in place to send out for PMR
      - Need to figure out the options/details for the desired behavior
      - Catherine Kane(sp?) in OBI
      - David/OCTO/OBI to make a decision
  Document Upload migration
      - How does polling work today?
      - How should polling work for 526/other products
      - Ancillary forms(4142, others?)
      - Should 526 submission include upload of all documents? Needs discovery
      - Do we create 781 and upload?
        - Yes, we think - Austin  
- Toxic Exposure Questions
   -   Additional dates for location - send them to 15 B, C, D or E?
       - Dump in 15E   
   -   Addition hazard of type "Other" - Only one for MVP?
   -   Radiobutton captions in column 2 for all radio buttons
- Shipping code with feature flag off before staging review with Governance team

### Date: Dec 07' 2023       
### Participants: Rakshinda, Austin, Emily, Steve, Shannon 
### Topics Covered:
- 4142 failures
  - First action is to review past 90 days of failures and get a clean list of unique failures
  - Open question:
    - Is order of operation?: 1. Transform data to pass Central Mail regex 2. Reprocess known failures 3. Migrate to Benefits API
      - Would any 526 submission with a failed 4142 submission block VBA from processing their claim?
    - Who is contact at Central Mail where we can get current Regex rules?
    - How should we handle current known failures? Resend throigh central mail once regex fix in place?
    - Should we / can we identify past 4142 failures prior to 90 days ago?
   Notes:
    - 0894 is not in production for 526
    - 0781 goes through Benefits API
    - 4142 is the only 516 form going through Mail Automation Portal - Scott confirming
    - MAS applying Regex for all meta data? Need to confirm
    - Scott to list all meta data regex patterns he sees 
    - How are we storing the failures for all forms in benefits portfolio? - Sam (not from Team 2) is looking into it
       - The error that happened
       - Information needed to resubmit the form
- Simple forms for benefits ITF submission
  - Forms team is digitizing the standalone process to submit an ITF for benefits
  - In addition to a logged in use case that uses the ITF end point in same manner as 526 they are introducing a new use case where the Veteran can submit an ITF without logging in.
  - In this case there is a risk that the date of submission will not be the same date used by VBA once it is processed through Central Mail.
    - Question: can we confirm that we need ITF submission date to = date of submission, not date it is processed through Central Mail?
- Document user experience during maintenance windows/outages
    - Identify different types of outages
    - Start with discovery of UX during code roll and planned maintenance in our control
  Notes:
    - Faraday breakers? A system watches for failing APIs and stops calling them
    - Pager duty EVSS integration
    - DD - can put in downtime to block monitors to stop alerting during planned maintenance
      - veterans and monitoring team 
- Priorities for Team 1
    - LH Migration 
    - Toxic Exposure
    - Other 526 sync with 2022 paper form

- Team 2 is taking watch tower alerting for this sprint
### Date: Nov 30' 2023       
### Participants: Rakshinda, Austin, Emily, Steve, Shannon 
### Topics Covered:
- Questions about 526 like whether new military service questions(21D and E) should be made required or not
  - Do we ask Emily/David Reis/both? What's a good communication channel for these kinds of questions without waiting for the biweekly VBA check-in?
    - Send a slack/email to Emily and David
    - Shannon - can we get a default guidance on what field is optional?
        - Lean towards not making them required
           - Check if the field is in VBMS/BGS and is required when making this decision
- How do we want to approach identifiying and prioritizing work for next year, esp research and design as they could be freed up by end of December?
  - Do we continue on with partial 4142 work?
     - Is it still higher in priority than other ideas?
     - Do we want to tackle evidence upload as a whole, something else?    
- Backup path failures, general review of Validation Errors, Service unavailable, and Niche errors that we believe wont return
   -   Increasing backup path retries to 14 from 5
   -   Timeframe between retries doubles between every retry (14 retries will land between 2-3 days)
   -   Will be around .01% for backup path failures
   -   Niche errors - will only monitor for now
- Updates "user signed-at date on all ancillary forms"
   - User signed-dates are incorrect
   - Dating the ancillary forms with the ancillary form creation date stamp and not the pdf creation date.
     - pdf creation date could be upto 1 year after ITF date and ancillary forms can get dated upto a year after the 526 form date
     - Could create a problem for batch processing
- Bugs submitted by Kimberly - considering they are old can we lower priority. Some mention a bug that we have looked at before and can finish after doc upload migration is complete
     -  Mostly old bugs
     -  Review after document upload service is complete
     -  Respond to Kimberley to close the loop on issue communication
- Issue Management operationalization
   - Jen B is looking at over all strategy for Benefits Portfolio
   -

### Date: Oct 12' 2023       
### Participants: Rakshinda, Austin, Shannon, Emily, Steve 
### Topics Covered:
- Prod access
  - Is prod access (such as to argo) intended to be limited again? (Unsubstantiated, but heard this around the grapevine)
            - If so, curious where the initiatives/research for tooling that would remove our dependency on prod access are?
            - This included things like preview environments, administrative endpoints, fetch applications, db interfaces with obfuscated data, etc.
            - Prod access is pretty essential for our day-to-day
            - Not sure if there is an official change in acess policy
            - Steve A offered to pair when needed
            - Continue requesting access as today until we find otherwise
- Follow-up from David Kesselman
   -   BDD Flow - Missing address and service dates - Not sure but we might have identified this as a VBMS issue
   -   New question on current va.gov functionality
      -  If an applicant indicates an ambiguous condition such as “joint pain,” will the va.gov interviewer prompt the applicant to clarify/specify?
- Follow up on Rated Disabilities fix, working with EVSS and LH for fixing validations issues, and cost of “back up path”
     - 429 throttling error from LH
     - Logging bug - BGS sent a non-retriable error that we kept trying for 13 days. This was a valid request and should not have been rejected.
     - How much effort do we want to put in for not sending these to MAS?
        - Similar issue with Dependency application - these happen due to lack of FE validations
        - Need to audit all these errors and put in FE validations as needed
           - Is high in priority and open to deprioritize other items - Emily
           - Put all these in a list for follow-up
           - Starting with Thomas's list - https://dvagov-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/thomas_blackwell2_va_gov/Documents/Microsoft%20Teams%20Chat%20Files/686SubmissionFailures.xlsx?d=w343bd41ae7d1468298026391989f2082&csf=1&web=1&e=2zV4V2

### Topics covered:
- Future DOC Bug - [what we learnt](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C8R3JS8BU/p1683646680437329?thread_ts=1683565044.419109&cid=C8R3JS8BU) <br>
   From: Cooper, Barrett E., VBAVACO  <br>
Sent: Wednesday, February 3, 2021 9:16 AM  <br>
Subject: Date of Contention  <br>
Is it possible to make the date of contention for BDD and BDD-Excluded claims submitted on VA.gov as the date of claim which is the day after discharge? The field is reporting VA.gov is entering the date the claim was submitted. We are required to enter the contention with the date of the day after discharge.
    - So using service exit date as claim open date is by design. Should we consider adding a validation to prevent them from entering contract end date as a solution?
    - Bring it up on the next VBA sync
- VAMC bug 
   - User is not able to enter VAMC and move forward
   - We find that it is not necessary input as it gets ignored by VSR/RVSR
   - Should we consider removing this or making it optional? Do we need to run this by Alejandro/Matt B - Bring it up on the next VBA sync
- Bugs/Defects strategy
   - Determine severity of the bug with the stakeholders / contact center
      - Middle of the sprint
      - Number of veterans / percentage of users affected / etc.  
      - When did the issue start?
      - Specific example
      - Send an email to Rakshinda/Matt with as much information as possible
      - Action Item - RA - Rubric for bug severity assessment
      - Action item - RA - Review with the team and share the Matt
      - Copy Matt on all emails with stakeholders,esp related to bugs
   -  Priortize bugs for discovery / fix for next sprint -   
- Bugs - what are we picking next
   - Bug fix for past date for BDD
   - Possibly discovery for Identification error

### Date: Jan 31st 2023
### Attendees - Matt Self, Rakshinda Aslam

### Topics covered:
- Introductions
- What is the mission for the BDE (Benefits Disability Experience) team?
At the highest level, the core disability experience team is here to own, from the ground up, the online submission experience for Veteran disability compensation claims and to make that experience as fast and easy as possible to complete, while ensuring submissions are timely, accurate, and in a state that allow VSR and RVSRS (the people who review and rate claims) to rate them quickly and easily!
- Are there any road-maps/2023 goals in existence?
Emphasizing from the blurb above, the key factors I'd like to move the needle on are:
  - SPEED: I'd like to reduce by half, the time it takes to submit a disability application online (10th %tile)
  - EASE: Applications should require as little cognitive burden and as few points of active interaction as possible
  - ACCURACY: applications should have 50% fewer errors than those submitted on paper (including PDFs)
  - OUTCOMES: VA.gov-submitted applications should result in more favorable outcomes (this one is squishy and perhaps gets eliminated)

Comments: There is not a lot of data behind these goals. We may need to design research to get anecdotal information that will help build a baseline, inform future work and check for post resolution data for success.
- Do we have short term/immediate goals for which work is in progress?
  - Looking at work flowing in three main workstreams 
  - Bugs/defects from the 526 form submission flow on VA.gov
        - This is not 24 by 7 operational support. Team will need to work on prioritized bugs mid-sprint, as needed.
  - Integrate with API transition from eVSS to Lighthouse infrastructure
        - 3 APIs on the transition roadmap
          - One in progress
          - One to be started
          - One will be decommissioned and needs to connect to a different existing Lighthouse API or built in-house)
  - Conduct research (w/vets, stakeholders, claims processors, and perhaps others) to identify opportunities and build a roadmap to make progress on the goals above
Comments: 
  - Item i and ii could be good for onboarding engineers and getting them used to the code base. 
  - Plenty of old research to be found on https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/disability/526ez
  - Do we have a list of issues identified with the current core submission process?
    - Yes - Matt to look for the zenhub board link
    - Older ones may not be valid anymore, look for validity
    - 508/Accessibility ones need to be looked at - those are valid and the outcome of a recent accessibility audit.

### Action items:
