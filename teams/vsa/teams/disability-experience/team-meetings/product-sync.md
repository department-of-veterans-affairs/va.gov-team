### Date: May 10 2023
### Topics covered:
- Future DOC Bug - [what we learnt](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C8R3JS8BU/p1683646680437329?thread_ts=1683565044.419109&cid=C8R3JS8BU) <br>
   From: Cooper, Barrett E., VBAVACO  <br>
Sent: Wednesday, February 3, 2021 9:16 AM  <br>
Subject: Date of Contention  <br>
Is it possible to make the date of contention for BDD and BDD-Excluded claims submitted on VA.gov as the date of claim which is the day after discharge? The field is reporting VA.gov is entering the date the claim was submitted. We are required to enter the contention with the date of the day after discharge.
    - So using service exit date as claim open date is by design. Should we consider adding a validation to prevent them from entering contract end date as a solution?
    - Bring it up on the next VBA sync
- VAMC bug 
   - User is not able to enter VAMC and move forward
   - We find that it is not necessary input as it gets ignored by VSR/RVSR
   - Should we consider removing this or making it optional? Do we need to run this by Alejandro/Matt B - Bring it up on the next VBA sync
- Bugs/Defects strategy
   - Determine severity of the bug with the stakeholders / contact center
      - Middle of the sprint
      - Number of veterans / percentage of users affected / etc.  
      - When did the issue start?
      - Specific example
      - Send an email to Rakshinda/Matt with as much information as possible
      - Action Item - RA - Rubric for bug severity assessment
      - Action item - RA - Review with the team and share the Matt
      - Copy Matt on all emails with stakeholders,esp related to bugs
   -  Priortize bugs for discovery / fix for next sprint -   
- Bugs - what are we picking next
   - Bug fix for past date for BDD
   - Possibly discovery for Identification error

### Date: Jan 31st 2023
### Attendees - Matt Self, Rakshinda Aslam

### Topics covered:
- Introductions
- What is the mission for the BDE (Benefits Disability Experience) team?
At the highest level, the core disability experience team is here to own, from the ground up, the online submission experience for Veteran disability compensation claims and to make that experience as fast and easy as possible to complete, while ensuring submissions are timely, accurate, and in a state that allow VSR and RVSRS (the people who review and rate claims) to rate them quickly and easily!
- Are there any road-maps/2023 goals in existence?
Emphasizing from the blurb above, the key factors I'd like to move the needle on are:
  - SPEED: I'd like to reduce by half, the time it takes to submit a disability application online (10th %tile)
  - EASE: Applications should require as little cognitive burden and as few points of active interaction as possible
  - ACCURACY: applications should have 50% fewer errors than those submitted on paper (including PDFs)
  - OUTCOMES: VA.gov-submitted applications should result in more favorable outcomes (this one is squishy and perhaps gets eliminated)

Comments: There is not a lot of data behind these goals. We may need to design research to get anecdotal information that will help build a baseline, inform future work and check for post resolution data for success.
- Do we have short term/immediate goals for which work is in progress?
  - Looking at work flowing in three main workstreams 
  - Bugs/defects from the 526 form submission flow on VA.gov
        - This is not 24 by 7 operational support. Team will need to work on prioritized bugs mid-sprint, as needed.
  - Integrate with API transition from eVSS to Lighthouse infrastructure
        - 3 APIs on the transition roadmap
          - One in progress
          - One to be started
          - One will be decommissioned and needs to connect to a different existing Lighthouse API or built in-house)
  - Conduct research (w/vets, stakeholders, claims processors, and perhaps others) to identify opportunities and build a roadmap to make progress on the goals above
Comments: 
  - Item i and ii could be good for onboarding engineers and getting them used to the code base. 
  - Plenty of old research to be found on https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/disability/526ez
  - Do we have a list of issues identified with the current core submission process?
    - Yes - Matt to look for the zenhub board link
    - Older ones may not be valid anymore, look for validity
    - 508/Accessibility ones need to be looked at - those are valid and the outcome of a recent accessibility audit.

### Action items:
- Schedule a cadence for product sync - weekly to begin with? - Rakshinda
- Schedule a kick-off with the BDE team and Matt - early next week? - Rakshinda
- Request mural board access as a user with rights to create Mural boards. - Matt?
