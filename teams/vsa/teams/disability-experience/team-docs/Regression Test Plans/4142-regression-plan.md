# Regression test plan

> A Regression Test Plan is a document that maps user stories to tests and which includes the results of executing those tests, thereby providing a strategy for verifying the functionality of your product prior to the work moving through the Collaboration Cycle.

We made three NEW test cases specifically for this effort, in TestRail, that map to our user stories and functionality described by our testing plan.

These additions ensure that each high-level user story has a test case ensuring functionality. 

In additon to these TestRail tests, we have also introduced many unit tests in both the frontend and backend and a cypress test.

# Traceability Statement

According to our testing, 100% of the high-level, critical use-cases are represented in our test plan. In addition to the high-level requirement, many more detailed specifics are covered by unit tests and cypress tests. In addition to TestRail, Unit test, and Cypress tests, manual end-to-end testing has taken place ensuring document flows through all systems as expected.
