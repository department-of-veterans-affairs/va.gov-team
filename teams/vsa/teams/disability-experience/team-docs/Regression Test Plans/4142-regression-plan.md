# Regression test plan

> A Regression Test Plan is a document that maps user stories to tests and which includes the results of executing those tests, thereby providing a strategy for verifying the functionality of your product prior to the work moving through the Collaboration Cycle.

TODO: In order to make sure our changes did not affect the overall 526 flow, we performed intially the existing [526 Minimal Regression test in TestRail](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/index.php?/cases/view/37806)


In addition to the existing 526 overall regression test, we made three NEW test cases specifically for this effort, in TestRail, that map to our user stories and functionality described by our testing plan.

These additions ensure that each high-level user story has a test case ensuring functionality. 

The results/report can be seen below:

Current level of tests executed at time of writing is pictured below (71%), with additional testing continuing through remaining testing cycles.

In additon to these TestRail tests, we have also introduced many unit tests in both the frontend and backend and a cypress test.


# Traceability Statement

TODO: confirm  in test rail  

According to our testing, 100% of the high-level, critical use-cases are represented in our test plan. In addition to the high-level requirement, many more detailed specifics are covered by unit tests and cypress tests. In addition to TestRail, Unit test, and Cypress tests, manual end-to-end testing has taken place ensuring document flows through all systems as expected.
