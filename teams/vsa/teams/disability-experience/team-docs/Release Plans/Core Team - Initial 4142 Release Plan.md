# Release Plan: 4142 Paper Sync - MVP 


## Purpose
The purpose of this release plan is to document and align the delivery teams and stakeholders on what will be delivered and when. This release plan is specifically for the 4142 Paper Sync MVP (first release). 
It is not intended to include the next generation of enhancements to the 4142 product.

## Feature description

## Project goals
Create a new 4142 online form that will match the newest paper version of the PDF form. 
The data in the online form will be used in the generation of the new (2024) 4142 PDF that will be sent to Central Mail (and eventually the eFolder further downstream) after a successful submit.

## Success criteria
- Support 100% of 526 users in the ability to submit a 4142 that is the new 2024 version

## Risks

  
**Risk:** In trying to release the new version of the form, we inadvertently negatively affect the existing version.

**Mitigation:** By having monitors that count the old version of the form submitted, and new, we will catch any dip or anomaly in old submissions. Additionally our unit testing, and end to end testing both test not only the new flow, but also that the old flow is unaffected.


 
**Risk:** Form is not being filled out correctly, or not getting where it needs to.

**Mitigation:** Post release monitoring and validation/tracing is designed to mitigate this risk.



**Risk:** Users are confused by the UI/UX form or flow.

**Mitigation:**



**Risk:** A bug in new code prevents the overall submission of the 526ez submission.

**Mitigation:** End to end testing covers most of this risk. Our dashboards also cover overall submissions numbers, and evaluation will be done with each roll-out increment to ensure error-rate and submission numbers are not anomalous.
