# Release Plan: 0781 Redirect  

## Purpose
The purpose of this release plan is to document and align the delivery teams and stakeholders on what will be delivered and when. 

## Project Description
For Veterans who have started their claim process since the new online paper sync for 0781 was released and who want to apply for benefits or services related to PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) or mental health issues, this feature will notify the user that there is a new PDF paper form that is more current than the online version. Unlike today in the production where the newest version of the PDF is available, this feature will let the user know that the new version of the form includes questions related to mental health that the online version does not have and encourage them to download it.

## Project Goals
- Notify the user that there is new version of the PDF that is more current than the online version
- Increase the number of claims with file uploads vs. online for PTSD
