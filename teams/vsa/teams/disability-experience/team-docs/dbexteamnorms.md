## How We Work
- [ ] The DBEx team 1 delivers value in 2 week sprints. Sprints begin on Wednesday and end on Tuesdays. Before each sprint, we set product goals and prioritize stories that align with those goals. As a team, we commit to the work being done before the sprint begins. At the end of each sprint, we examine how we did and brainstorm ways to improve as a team to meet our goals and take care of each other as human beings.
- [ ] We track our work using ZenHub.
- [ ] Our stories should include:
   - [ ] Value Statement (why the work should be done)
   - [ ] Meet the team Definition of Ready
   - [ ] Include an estimate
   - [ ] At the end of the sprint, they should meet the team Definition of Done
- [ ] When ad hoc requests / bug fix requests come in, we will determine urgency and priority before working on these requests mid-sprint. As a rule, we will give ourselves ~3 story points to handle incoming requests as needed.

## Definition of Ready
 - [ ] I know where to start
 - [ ] I know where to stop - Acceptance Criteria / learning goals are clearly defined
 - [ ] Value is clearly defined
 - [ ] Wireframes/design/content/research/API RFC complete
 - [ ] Dependencies clearly stated
 - [ ] Prioritized (due date where applicable)
 - [ ] Sized
 - [ ] Small in size (can be finished in a sprint)

## Definition of Done
 - [ ] Meets Acceptance Criteria / learning goals
 - [ ] Documentation created where applicable
 - [ ] Plan/create new tickets on completion where applicable
 - [ ] QA artifacts for collab cycle
 - [ ] Code reviews approved
 - [ ] Continuous integration passing
 - [ ] Shippable or live in production
 - [ ] Research plan reviewed
 - [ ] Test population identified
 - [ ] Research plan/report attached to the ticket

## Relative Sizing
- [ ] 1
   - [ ] No unknowns
   - [ ] Very specific
   - [ ] Can generally be done in a day or less
   - [ ] Easiest, smallest “I know for sure this can be done right now, no questions asked”
   - [ ] No dependencies outside of myself
- [ ] 2
   - [ ] Very specific
   - [ ] Relatively trivial, but would generally take longer than a day to complete
   - [ ] Like a 1, but has other related tasks or dependencies that take more time
- [ ] 3
   - [ ] There may be 2-3 closely related tasks, each of which is simple
   - [ ] May be some unknowns but nothing that’s a dealbreaker
   - [ ] Not easy, but we’ve done this kind of work in the past
   - [ ] I can fit this task in my head at one time
- [ ] 5
   - [ ] We will have to learn some new things, but are confident in how long that would take
   - [ ] May be cognitively demanding work, like synthesis
   - [ ] Small group of closely related tasks that cannot be separated
- [ ] 8
   - [ ] Some unknowns, hard to tell how much work will be involved from the start
   - [ ] Large group of related tasks that may be able to be separated
- [ ] 13
   - [ ] Cannot be completed in one sprint by one person, needs multiple people
   - [ ] Should be broken down, unless there is a good reason not to
- [ ] Greater than 13
   - [ ] Break it up!
