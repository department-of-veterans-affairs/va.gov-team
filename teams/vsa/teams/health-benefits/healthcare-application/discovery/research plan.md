# Draft Research Plan for [Caregiver, Health Care Application, November 2020]
As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	(This should be filled out and maintained by the designer on the team & can be cross-linked and referenced in any issues.) 	
## Goals	
This reserach is being conducted on the Health Care Application by the Caregiver team.

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?

**Research Objectives**

- Understand if there are any opportunities to improve the online experience in applying for health care benefits with the VA. 
- Prioritize recommendations, including design and technical solutions, based on these findings.

**The research questions we want to address are:**
- How do Veterans learn of the HCA and what are their motivations when applying? 
- What is the Veteran’s journey when accessing the digital HCA? 
- What is the Veteran experience of the online HCA? 
- Do Veterans understand the application process? Some common questions Veterans have when applying with the online application?  
- What are the drop off points within the HCA?
- What do Veterans expect to happen after they’ve submitted the form?
- What is the average time an application takes to be processed? 
- Do Veterans prefer to complete the application online or via the paper process? Why?

**Our hypothesis**
- There is an overall drop in online applications 
- There are obstacles preventing the Vetern from completing the digital HCA 
- TBD (informed by analytics) 

## Method	

**Analytics**

Leverage Google Analytics to understand current behavior and interactions of Veterans with the HCA (10-10EZ) 

- Completion trend for online applications 
- What is the entry point for the intro page (subway map) of the HCA? 
- What are the drop off points within the HCA? 

**Qualitative Interviews**

Qualitative Interviews will be conducted remotely with Zoom. Qualitative Interviews explore the views, experiences, beliefs and/or motivations of individuals. Remote observers and note takers will be in attendance.  

**Why this method?**

How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	
3.	Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)*	
4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 	
5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	
## Participants and Recruitment
