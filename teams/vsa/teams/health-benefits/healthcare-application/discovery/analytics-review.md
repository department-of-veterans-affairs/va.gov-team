#  Health Care Application discovery: Analytics review

## Project overview

As part of the Health Care Application Discovery Sprint, we will conduct an analytics review to learn more about user behavior related to the Health Care Application (HCA). 

## Goals

Analytics are an especially good way of seeing what people are doing. They can't tell us "why," but they can tell us "what." The team wanted to gain insight into the following:

- Completion trend for the online HCA application  
- What is the entry point for the intro page (subway map) of the HCA?
- What are the drop off points within the HCA?

**Examine data from Call Centers ((key word search, calls regarding HCA)**
**Satisfaction surveys**
**Was there a simpler trend in paper applications as well (Lauren Alexanderson)**
