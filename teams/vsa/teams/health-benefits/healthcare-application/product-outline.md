## Assumptions
- If we make the online health care application easier, fewer Veterans will feel uncomfortable applying online.

## Solution Approach

- As of 10/2020, we're going to focus on:
   - Understanding what Veteran pain points are with the current application process (research and discovery)
   - Updating the UI to meet VA.gov design & accessibility standards
   - Adding a question distinguishing between mailing & residential addressses
   - Updating any content around the health care application pages that may be a source of confusion
   - Updating the questions on the online form to align with the new 10-10EZ
- As of 11/2020, we're going to focus on:
   - Validating assumptions regarding usage of the online form pre- and during COVID
   - Using that research to guide whether to focus our Q1 efforts on the form itself or how Veterans get to the form.
