# Initiative Outline - Sign as a Representative 
---

## Overview
* We will be allowing the representatives of Veterans to sign forms on behalf of the Veteran and upload documentation related to their authority to do so.

## Problem Statement

* Veterans may have designated a family member or friend to act as their representative. The 10-10CG defines a representative as:
`A person who, under applicable law, has authority to act on behalf of the Veteran or who is legally vested with the responsibility or care of the
Veteran. Evidence must be submitted with this form to establish a person's legal status as Representative. Such evidence may be a valid power of
attorney, legal guardianship order, or similar legal documentation or certification issued by an appropriate authority, including a Federal, State, local,
or tribal law that establishes such authority. (Next-of-kin is therefore not automatically the Representative of the Veteran as this must be established
under applicable law.)`
Representatives who act on behalf of Veterans need a way to upload the evidence related to their representative relationship to their Caregiver application, and sign the online form with their own name.

How might we set up the online form to allow Veterans' representatives to complete forms on the Veteran's behalf?

 
## Desired User Outcomes
- Representatives can sign an online form and upload the documentation related to their representative status.
- Veterans who have representatives can feel confident filling out forms.
- Less burden down the line to provide documentation surrounding representative relationship

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Veterans who don't have representatives are confused by the set up of the form.
- Veterans with representatives still prefer to apply through other means.
- Increased difficulty completing the online form


## Desired Business Outcomes
- CSCs can (more easily and earlier) have representative documentation as a part of the Veteran's Family Caregiver application

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Increase in the number of applications that fail to be sent through

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

- Number of online Caregiver applications filled out by a representative per month
- Number of online Caregiver applications filled out per month
- Number of dropped/failed attachments
- User feedback (ForeSee)
- Feedback from CSCs on utility


#### Baseline KPI Values
- Number of online Caregiver applications filled out by a representative per month: 0
- Number of online Caregiver applications filled out per month:

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

## Assumptions
- Representatives will have their legal documentation on hand
- Preexisting "upload an attachment" components will work for this use case
- Filling out the signature box as the representative will be legally sufficient

## Solution Approach

### Initial goals
- Fill out the signature box as a representative
- Upload documentation related to representative relationship

### Risks
- Legal concerns
- Confusing Veterans
- Standardizing across other forms
- POA means different things
