# Caregiver Backlog

## In progress
- Allow caregiver applicants to select a signature certification checkbox
- Ability to use the 10-10CG online form to add only a secondary caregiver
- Ability to temporarily disable the form using the VA.gov Platform downtime service if we know a service (MVI, CARMA) is down
- Retry sending PDF if it fails the first time (should resolve cases of submissions to CARMA that are missing PDFs)

## Up next (unprioritized)

- Support additional languages in the online form (Spanish, etc)
- Ability for a Veteran/caregiver to attach Power of Attorney (POA) documentation to online application
- Ability for VA.gov to send a confirmation receipt to Veterans and/or caregivers after submission
- Ability to re-submit the form after failure
- Create a separate page for application failures (to create a cleaner experience for the applicant)
- Improve facility labels/mapping to clinics
- 10-10CG form content change
- Work with CARMA to store the original submission data (payload), so that original data from the online application can be referenced
- Allow user to download PDF after successful submission

## Long term (unprioritized) 
- Notify Veterans/caregivers via email or text when their application status changes
- Allow Caregivers to check their application status online
- Portal to allow Veterans/caregiver to track and manage benefits
- Allow Veterans to submit the 10-10CG from their logged-in account
