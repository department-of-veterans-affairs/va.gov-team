#### Issue Etiquette
- Anyone on the team can create a(n) issue/ticket/story. 
- All teammates are responsible for keeping them up to date.
- Templates are available within the new issue/ticket/story during creation - Pick one you like!
- The [Epic Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/1010-Epic-template.md) will be used to include the high-level details and a task list that will convert into stories

**Labels to use**
- All tickets should include:
     - 1010-team
     - Product: Either 1010-ez, 1010-ezr or 1010-cg
- EZ initiative labels (examples)
     - 1010-short-form
     - 10-10ez-notifications
     - household-info-redesign

     - toxic-exposure

- Naming convention for tickets/stories/tasks
    - [area of work] FormID - Epic/Initiative: Brief title of work to be done
    - _Example_: [FE] 10-10EZ - Shortform: Change accordian alert to expandable alert

**Epics** should include:
   - Clear acceptance criteria
   - Definition of done  
   - A user story that reflects the benefit to a Veteran, Caregiver, or other user
   - Been broken up into discreet tasks/Github tickets that are attatched to the epic
   - All components/steps have been accounted for in the epic

**Stories/Tickets** should include:

   - Includes:
        - Description (what happened & why we need this ticket), 
        - General tasks to perform
        - Acceptance criteria (expected result)

- If there are new work requests or sudden changes, contact the Product Manager to assist in scheduling into the sprint

#### Estimation
We use fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) to account for the level of effort, complexity, and amount of unknowns in our work. Here is our guide:
| Number | Meaning |
| -------| --------|
| 1  | Trivial change - Up to 2 hours  (time mostly in submitting the work)
| 2  | Small change - Up to 4 hours  (More validation is required)
| 3  | Routine addon/none new - 1 to 2 days (small work/high domain knowledge/1 or no moving parts)
| 5  | Routine addon/none new - 2 to 3 days (medium work/1-2 moving parts)
| 8  | New work/High Complexity - 3 to 5 days (over 2 moving parts)
| 13 | Too big/Risky, should be broken down - 1 to 2 weeks


#### User story validation
- All team members are responsible for validation, but different team members will specialize in different areas.
- For anything considered a "release" or significant change, the QA lead will be responsible for QA
- Engineers will be responsible for ensuring and documenting in the ticket that all acceptance criteria are met
- Design is responsible for ensuring that design and content specifications are met
- PM and PO will be responsible for end-to-end QA and communication to stakeholders


## Team Norms
- We iterate often and deliver frequently
- We are respectful, both online and off
- We turn on cameras as often as possible at meetings / calls
- We are flexible and intentional in the way we work
- We communicate often and in public channels
- We ask questions when they arise
- We listen without judgement
- We keep our work simple and clean
- We validate each others' work
- We do reviews in independent environments
- We hold each other accountable
- We stick to our commitments as best as possible
- We are respectful of others' time


#### Slack "#1010-health-apps":

- This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.

#### GitHub
- GitHub is the single source of truth. All work is documented for tracking and planning.

#### PTO
- We will respect time off and understand that mental, physical, and personal health is the top priority for team members
- Team members will send calendar invites to the rest of team when they have scheduled time off.

#### General things
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Extra time? Explore the "Refined & Prioritized" column in [GitHub](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team#workspaces/10-10-health-apps-5fff0cfd1462b6000e320fc7/board).
