</p>
</details>

#### Issue Etiquette
Anyone on the team can create a user story. All are responsible for keeping them up to date.

- We use epics to represent user stories. For an epic to go into the **"Epic"** column, it should have:
    - Clear acceptance criteria
    - Definition of done  
    - A user story that reflects the benefit to a Veteran, Caregiver, or other user
    - Been broken up into discreet tasks/Github tickets that are attatched to the epic
    - All components/steps have been accounted for in the epic
    - Documented risks: Risks: Value Risk, Feasibility Risk, Business Viability Risk, Usability Risk

- Naming convention for tickets/stories/tasks - Thoughts?
    - [area of work] Epic/Initiative: Brief title of work to be done
    - _Example_: [FE] 1010EZ Shortform: Change accordian alert to expandable alert

- For a task to go into the **"Icebox"** column, it must have the following:
   - Title that explains the goal
   - Labels: _vsa-10-10_ and what category it falls into (backend, front-end, research, design, product)

- For a task to go into the **"Backlog"** column, it must have the following:
   - Title that explains the goal in plain language
   - Linked to a user story/epic
   - Includes (as needed) background, goal and acceptance criteria   

- For a task to go into the **"Ready"** column, it must have the following:
   - Be groomed by the team
   - Estimate
   - Sense of priority (relative to other tickets)
   
- During Sprint Planning, we'll move tickets into the **"Current Sprint"** column
- As they are worked, tickets get moved into **"In Progress"**

- For a task to be in **"Blocked"** 
   - An external dependency prevents the ticket from being completed
   
- For a task to be in **"Validate"** 
   - All work related to the ticket is implemented
   - Acceptance criteria have been met
   - Work is accessible in a review instance and ready for internal team members to review

- For a task to be **"Done"** 
   - Internal validation has occured
   - Merged to master
   - Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect when validation has occurred and by whom
   - Any next steps (turning on in Production, stakeholder review, follow up tickets) have been documented

- If there are new work requests or sudden changes, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

#### Estimation
We use fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) to account for the level of effort, complexity, and amount of unknowns in our work. Here is our guide:
| Number | Meaning |
| -------| --------|
| 1  | Trivial change - Up to 2 hours  (time mostly in submitting the work)
| 2  | Small change - Up to 4 hours  (More validation is required)
| 3  | Routine addon/none new - 1 to 2 days (small work/high domain knowledge/1 or no moving parts)
| 5  | Routine addon/none new - 2 to 3 days (medium work/1-2 moving parts)
| 8  | New work/High Complexity - 3 to 5 days (over 2 moving parts)
| 13 | Too big/Risky, should be broken down - 1 to 2 weeks


#### User story validation
- All team members are responsible for validation, but different team members will specialize in different areas.
- For anything considered a "release" or significant change, Tze (the VSA QA lead) will be responsible for QA
- Engineers will be responsible for ensuring and documenting in the ticket that all acceptance criteria are met
- Design is responsible for ensuring that design and content specifications are met
- PM and PO will be responsible for end-to-end QA and communication to stakeholders


## Team Norms
- We iterate often and deliver frequently
- We are respectful, both online and off
- We turn on cameras as often as possible at meetings / calls
- We are flexible and intentional in the way we work
- We communicate often and in public channels
- We ask questions when they arise
- We listen without judgement
- We keep our work simple and clean
- We validate each others' work
- We do reviews in independent environments
- We hold each other accountable
- We stick to our commitments as best as possible
- We are respectful of others' time


#### Slack "#1010-health-apps":

This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.

#### GitHub
GitHub is the single source of truth. All work is documented for tracking and capacity planning.

#### PTO
- We will respect time off and understand that mental, physical, and personal health is the top priority for team members
- Team members will send calendar invites to the rest of team when they have scheduled time off, **and** add it to the VSA PTO calendar

#### General things
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
