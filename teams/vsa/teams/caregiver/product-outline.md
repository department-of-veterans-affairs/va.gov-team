# Executive Summary

## User Problem Statement

As a caregiver or veteran, it would be easier to apply for the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC) using an online form rather than the current paper submission process.

## Solution Goals

### User Goals
- Caregivers and veterans want to be able to fill out the 10-10CG online.

### Business Goals
- Feed application data directly to CARMA
- Accomodate the influx of applications that's expected due to changing program eligibility
- Make the user journey feel safer and more accomodating 

## Assumptions
- Caregivers and Veterans will prefer to fill out the 1010-CG online rather than on paper.


## Requirements and Constraints
- The paper 10-10CG requires wet signatures from both the Veteran and the Caregiver
- Many caregivers are used to filling out forms on behalf of their veterans
- Caregiver/Veteran relationships may change
- Some Veterans want to give their Caregiver access to all medical and benefits information, while others would not
- All legal language from the paper form must be online
- Phone numbers are required, e-mail addresses are not
- Limit online applications to those with a verified VA profile
- Send data to CARMA along with a PDF of the paper form will the filled-in information
 

## Discovery Takeaways
- Users like the idea of an online form
- Users like the ability to save the form in progress
- Users like the ability to download a submission receipt
- Mutliple online sources offer conflicting information
- Caregivers like the idea of having an online portal to access support, resources, and benefit information

## Value Propositions

#### User Value
 - Users will be able to apply for the PCAFC online

#### Business Value
- Start processing applications faster
- Fewer rejections

## KPIs and OKRs

- Why applications are unsuccesful (for failures, what triggered them)
- Average time to complete (online application)
- Qualitative metrics on the application process and overall experience
- Customer satisfaction (application process, caregiver program in general, etc.)
- Call Center reports

#### Baseline KPIs

## Go-to-market Strategy
- *How are Veterans and others using this product going to know it exists?*
- *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful?*

Note: as of 05/27, the program office has not made specific plans to release the online 10-10CG to the public. When they do, we'll reach out to CSCs and VSOs to broadcast the changes to the Caregiver community. 

## Target Launch Date
- *What is your target launch date of your MVP/iteration?*
- *What is your date for when you'll evaluate impact after launch?*

- Dark launch (not public facing): 05/29/2020
- Soft release (potential to be public facing): 07/30/2020

## How to Access and Test
