## Feature background

The VAMC MVP pages were designed with fixed locations offering multiple services in mind. As systems have rolled out nationwide, we realized this model doesn't fit 
mobile locations offering multiple services (mobile clinics). Forcing them into the fixed location model can lead to misleading, incomplete and/or inaccurate information. 

For example, the current VAMC page displays 
- one address, which is probably where it is parked overnight - rather than representing the various locations where services are delivered/available
- one set of hours - which may not represent true availability
- parking and transportation information, which may not be relevant to a mobile location 

## UX design and research work products

Phase	|	Purpose	|	Artifact	|	Notes
---	|	---	|	---	|	---
Discovery:  Initial discovery sprint with 5 health systems (PAOs, clinical managers, emergency mgmt)	|	Purpose: To understand how mobile clinics are being used across the country, so that we accurately represent them on VA.gov facility web pages. 	|	 [Research findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/initiatives/2021-vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/discovery/research-findings.md)	|	
Discovery/Design Round 1	|	Synthesis board with MMU/Mobile uses cases & Round 1 design	|	[Synthesis ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/initiatives/2021-vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/discovery/files/MMU-Discovery-Phase-2.pdf)  	|	Collection of MMU use cases from interviews with PAOs, emergency management and clinical staff. On the right side of the Mural, is a first round of design solutions/exploration for the various use cases.

Design Validation	|	Purpose: to validate or invalidate the MVP design of the new schedule section for use by mobile clinic/MMU facility types: 1) Identify problems with design 2) Discover opportunities to consider for future iterations.	|[Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/initiatives/2021-vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/discovery-round-2/research-findings.md)	|	Design feedback discussions with 2 health systems using MVP design
Final design	|	MVP solution, "smallest slice", that unblocks health systems to publish mobile clinic facility pages with multiple schedules	|	[Prototype in UXPin - Oct 2021](https://preview.uxpin.com/20fd05cf8e86ce628f0c813166424d0a6ca38bfd#/pages/142019860/documentation/sitemap) - Final MVP design with specs and documentation / [UXPin file (.UXP)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/initiatives/2021-vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/design/Mobile%20Clinic%20Schedule%20Section.uxp) - downloadable UXPin file, in case the prototype link ever breaks"	|	**Note:** This design **does not address** all the use cases uncovered as detailed in [discovery research findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/initiatives/2021-vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/discovery/research-findings.md) and [design validation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/initiatives/2021-vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/discovery-round-2/research-findings.md) documentation

### UX research studies
Research should be conducted to validate that the new design 
- helps Veterans understand how to find mobile clinic options at the system level (new grouping on VAMC Locations page)
- includes the information Veterans expect to find for mobile clinics
- supports understanding about mobile clinic location and service availability
