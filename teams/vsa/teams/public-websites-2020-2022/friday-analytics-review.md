## Find VA Forms - Search + Detail Pages
### Search
- still seeing traffic on the legacy forms search (why?!)
- 10-2850c is the top searched term (1yr)
  - backstory: lot of outreach to healthcare workers to support the pandemic

- Re: GSA outbound
  - how do we determine if there are "legit" failed searches vs. folks actively leaving to GSA bc they realize they're looking for a non-VA form
  - Number of no results 
  - Top queries for no resuts
  - GSA outbound clicks 

### Detail Pages
- PDF Downloads by Page doesn't necessarily tell us which PDFs (since we have other download urls besides the form pdf)

## Covid FAQs
