        - User Research planned to test adding link to search at bottom of Top Tasks boxes
        - Next Steps: Provided an overview of this to members of the Sitewide Crew on 8/3; the new PO/Crew Chief will need to help drive this forward.
      - **New Mobile header (Research initiative)**
        - [X] [Product Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/header-footer/initiatives/2021-new-mobile-header/product-outline.md)
        - [ ] Analytics baseline request -- e.g.. what is overall % usage of search on Mobile; what is % usage of search in header on Mobile. 
        - [ ] Research Plan - in-production test will require big tech lift for Mobile header; easier to do interactive prototype/usability test.
    - Outreach & Events Calendar - to harden multi-tenant users; to enable filtering of events
      - [X] [Product Outline for V1.0 of Events](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/outreach-events/product-outline.md)

      - Initiative is led by Meg/Mikki on the IA team -- with details [in this ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/digital-experience-products/issues/277)
    - Benefit Hubs Optimization - Content & IA 
      - Reducing hierarchy/links in left-nav for Hub pages (as Content moves pages into R&S)
      - Back button or other design element to return to Tier 1 from R&S
      - Larger item - CMS: COPE Single Q-and-A
      - [Initiative Brief WIP](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/benefit-hubs/initiatives/benefit-hub-optimization-initiative-brief.md)

  - **Maintain**
    - Resources & Support (with enhanced Video template in backlog)

  - **On the Radar**
    - Mission Act page goes away in Sept 30th.   Jenny H-L is helping us determine what happens (she seemed keen on the idea of redirecting to Mission Act to the Community Care page - https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/).  Danielle is also involved in figuring this out.
  
  - **Ideation**
    - Combined diability calulator:  Possibly interate on this elemenet as many open source options exist for Veterans however the VA.gov should be the standard for Veterans and the current calulator is currently missing elements to support a more fluid UX.
