# Research Plan for Veteran Top Tasks UNMODERATED (Phase 2 of 2) Survey, Sitewide Home Page team, June 6, 2022

## Background
The current design of the VA.gov home page provides easy access to some Veteran tasks in four boxes near the top of the page. [User research on the home page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-readout-full-June8.pdf) has shown that other tasks are more challenging to do when starting from the home page. 
We would like to learn which VA-related tasks are most important to Veterans and caregivers so that these tasks can be best supported from the home page.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme): 
- Increase the usage and throughput of VA services

### Veteran Journey
Veteran tasks fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) throughout 
- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life 
- Retiring and aging 

## Research Goals	
The goal of this research is to identify Veteran top tasks. We hope to find a set of 5-10 tasks that are most important from a set of 41 tasks. We want to get input from Veterans and others, including Veterans' family members or caregivers, survivors, and service members.

### Outcome
The top tasks that we identify could be used to inform the redesign of the VA.gov home page and measure the overall health of VA.gov. We can use the top tasks we identify to run baseline usability tests and then regular tests at intervals. Over time, these tests will tell us whether Veterans can quickly and easily complete all top tasks. We can also look at the navigation path(s) for each top task and examine analytics for them.

### Research questions
1. When Veterans or others contact the VA, what tasks are most important to them? 
2. How many tasks do Veterans and others identify as important to themselves?
3. What tasks are least important? 
5. Are there any important tasks missing?
6. What tasks are done most frequently online?

### Hypotheses
1. Veterans and others will generally agree on which tasks are the most important.
2. Veterans and others will generally agree on which tasks are the least important.

## Method: Unmoderated Survey
We will conduct an unmoderated study in which participants are invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants will receive a link to an online survey that contains a list of 41 VA-related tasks. The online survey will be built in Optimal Workshop's survey tool, which is called Questions. The survey will contain a list of 41 VA-related tasks that have been synthesized from colleagues, the VA.gov home page, user research studies, and top VA site searches. The list of tasks has been reviewed by colleagues in IA and Content. In order to keep the list down to a manageable length, some related tasks have been combined (e.g., *Learn about or apply for VA health care*), and a few tasks that are required to be supported have been omitted (e.g., *Contact the Veterans Crisis Line*, and *Report harassment that occurred at a VA site or online*). The survey design has already been refined following the phase 1 [moderated research study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/moderated/research-findings.md#appendix). 

In the survey, participants will select which VA-related tasks are important to them personally (*not* for all Veterans). Participants will also be asked if there are any VA-related tasks that are important to them that weren't on the list, and which tasks they do most frequently.

We would like to get complete survey responses from **at least 30 Veterans and others (ideally 40-50)**, in distinct cohorts of fewer than 10 participants per cohort (per PRA).

## Recruitment	

We would like Perigean to recruit **63** people using the cohorts below in order to get at least **30 completes (ideally 40-50)**.
Overall, we would like to get about 
- 2/3 Veterans and 1/3 Veterans' family members or caregivers, survivors, or service members
- At least 1/2 with experience using some VA benefits/services and 20% without such experience but interest in some

### Primary participant criteria:
- ALL have a computer or mobile device and are willing to use it to complete the activity
- This study will be broken up into 8 mini studies, segmented by the 8 cohorts below.

#### For Cohort A (9 Veterans)
- All **must NOT have experience with _VA health care_** but **MUST** have experience with at least one of _education, career services, disability, housing, pension, life insurance, or burial benefits_

- At least 15 people age 55 or older
- At least 5 people age 35 or under
- At least 10 people with a cognitive disability
- At least 10 people of color
- At least 5 people who don't have any degree or vocational training after high school (to include enlisted Veterans)

### Coordination with Perigean
To assess potential participants' experiences with VA benefits or services, please use their answers to the Digital Service at VA User Research Participant Recruiting Screener Questionnaire question *Which VA benefits or services do you have any experience with?"*

For potential participants who don't have any experience with VA benefits or services, the recruitment emails we provide will ask for interest in VA benefits or services.

We will provide an [outreach email template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/outreach-emails.md) and a unique survey link for Perigean to use when reaching out to each cohort of potential participants. 

We will include a required field at the beginning of the survey to collect a code from each participant. We expect Perigean to generate and provide a unique code to each participant for tracking completion and compensation. In order to minimize abandonment, please make very clear to participants that they need to use this code when they start the survey. 

We estimate it will take participants 5 minutes to complete the survey.

## Timeline
- The survey will be open for at least 1 week starting on June 14, and should remain open until there are at least 30 (ideally 40-50) completes.

### Prepare
- The survey link has been tested by several people on June 3.
