# OUTDATED Research Plan: Moderated usability of the redesigned VA.gov home page
# [GO HERE INSTEAD](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-plan.md)

## Background
The current VA.gov website was launched in 2018 but hadn't been the subject of much user research until [Baseline Wayfinding Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding#baseline-wayfinding-research-on-vagov-april-2021) was conducted in June 2021. Findings from this research has been incorporated into the new design. 

[Research to discover the most important tasks to Veterans, caregivers, family members, survivors and service members](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks) is in progress. Top tasks identified during this research will influence additional design changes and determine the tasks to validate the design during these sessions.  

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following OCTO objectives: 
- Veterans, caregivers, family members, survivors and service members are able to access tools and processes quickly and easily to learn about and manage their benefits
- Veterans, caregivers, family members, survivors and service members have increased access to self-service tools through an elevated login funnel

### Veteran Journey
Veteran tasks fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) throughout 
- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life 
- Retiring and aging 

## Research Goals	
The goal of this research is to validate that the new design has improved the usability of the homepage. Rather than focusing participant attention on individual homepage components, we will observe which areas they use and how well the homepage supported Veterans, VA beneficiaries and those acting on behalf of Veterans in the process of completing important benefit-related tasks.

### Outcome
This research will inform iteratons to the redesign, the need for future research, and release decisions for the iteration.

### Research questions
The following questions will be answered in the context of task-based scenarios (which will be informed by findings from Top Task research conducted in May/June 2022):
- Are participants able to easily and quickly initiate tasks from the homepage?
- What part(s) of the homepage do participants use for the task?
- Does the homepage support participants, including those using assistive tech, in completing their tasks?
- Do the words/labels used on the homepage support participant understanding?
- What do Veterans (and others) expect from various areas of the homepage, including search functionality and VAntage Point blog promo?

### Areas of focus
We are primarily interested in the following areas of the homepage, in context with the header or footer, which may also provide a path for task completion
- Login/signup CTA
- Common task list
- Search
- Benefit hubs
- VAntage Point blog promo

### Hypotheses
 
- The prominent sign in/sign up location and CTA makes it easier for Veterans to easily sign in/sign up.
- More Veterans will use the prominent sign in/sign up CTA than the header. 
- The streamlined design helps Veterans find the task they need to complete more quickly.
- The new design includes the most common/important Veteran-facing tasks.
- The link labels are sufficient for Veterans to understand/recognize.
- Veterans will know to search for tasks which are not listed as most common/popular. 
- Veterans understand where "other search tools" links will take them and what information they will find there.
- A focused and prominently displayed VAntage Point blog promo increases Veteran engagement with the content.

## Method
