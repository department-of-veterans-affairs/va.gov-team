# Legacy VA content

## As of 8/03/20

VA had 530 subdomains. Of them, we were able to map VA.gov and 380 VA subdomains.*

__We mapped over 450.3K URLs, including 57.7K PDFs.__ URLs include redirects and PDFs (and other files).
<br>
The list of 450.3 URLs includes: 

> __VA.gov__
> - __56.9K URLs, including 19.6K PDFs__
>
> We don't know how many of these public pages contain internal meeting notes, videos, and other materials.
<br>

> __Facilities__
> - __108.1K URLs, including 15.1K PDFs__ 
>
> Most of these ^ URLs are for VHA facilities; there are additional URLs for VBA facilities.
<br>

__Questions__
* How many URLs does VA currently have? 
* Where are they managed (TeamSite, WordPress)? 
* What's the usage data? 
* How many are legally required pages? 
* How many are tier 1 or tier 2 Veteran-facing? 
* How many are tier 3 administration, program, or office content?

_* We were able to crawl only VA.gov and 380 subdomains. The remaining subdomains had pages that could not be mapped (because of the way they were built) but probably do have content. So this is an undercount of what's really out there._
