## Who We Are:

Veteran Facing Services (VFS) Public Websites (PW) is a team with responsibilities across VA.gov, including public-facing content, benefit hubs, global menu, onsite search, and Find a VA Form experience.

## Our Current Focus:
Primary Goal 1: Increase the use of self-service tools and decrease the time users spend waiting for an outcome. 
Primary Goal 2: Decrease time users spend waiting for an outcome.
Priamry Goal 3: Consistent customer satisfaction, reliability and secure online user experience.

With that, we have two initiatives close to launch that aim to help inform and enable visitors to the site: The MVP version of Find a VA Form Search experience, and Learning Center MVP (1.0 and 1.1). 

From a content perspective, we have focused on providing a single source of truth for Veterans. To make this actionable, we are engaged in a tiered approach to rewriting, redirecting, and (in some cases) retiring content. We are completing outstanding work for VA Form Search, and are jumpstarting work for Learning Center initiatives in support of content and search capabilities. 


## Next 6-8 Weeks:

- Beginning now- we are finalizing launch efforts for VA Find Form - Form Details Landing pages and functionality. The goal remains to easily surface form information so that users (Veterans, Caregivers, etc.) can more easily apply for benefits via available online tools or download correct forms related to VA beneifts and compensation. The primary Drupal engineering effort is completed and updated. bug fixes and other related content redirect carries forward our goal to improve the Find a VA Form experience.. 

- Beginning now- we're developing a process that will help Veterans and others find the right online experience to apply for benefits by making it easier to complete "How to Apply" wizards. The team will facilitate this by iterating content pages to quickly navigate users to tools pages where wizards will help determine the right online application for a Veteran's situation.  The primary goal is to achieve a more seemless online experience to apply for beneifts that match Veterans search results saving time through accuratly completing the right forms from the onset.    

- Beginning now- we are in technical discovery and initial build requirments for Learning Center Landing page MVP 1.0 and 1.1. The goal is to easily surface learning center information for users (Veterans, Caregivers, etc.) to optimally apply for benefits via available online tools. This supports our goal to develop and deliver the content, navigation, and tools that provide our customers the easiest way to find and act upon any VA service. 


### Concerns:

The need to support unplanned critical initiatives can delay our planned projects. 

## Impact of near-term work on other VSA product teams:

Will continue our support for other teamsâ€™ initiatives and in-take requests. "No" breaking changes anticipated with our current initiatives.
