Issue Etiquette
- For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):
  * Estimate
  * Title that explains task
  * Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
  * Labels - Analytics-Insights, Call Center, Analytics Request
  * User Story, Goal, Acceptance Criteria - please fill out the Goal and any known acceptance criteria. The PM will revise as necessary.
  * Epic assigned
- All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.
- If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint
Estimation

Estimation is not based on how long something will take to complete, but is rather a combined rating encompassing risk, LOE, and complexity.

1 - Easy task, work is known, can be executed quickly  
2  
3 - Medium task, work is known and can be completed in one sprint  
5 - Work is discussed and planned for, and can be worked   
8 - Work is complex, needs to be discussed, and possibly be broken down into smaller tasks 
13 - Very complex, may take a full sprint or longer 

Team Norms

- Be respectful, both online and off
- Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
- Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
- We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
- Let’s have fun and do great work!

And some logistics:

- Keep as much Slack conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.
- GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to an issue or useful to document, copy them into GitHub.
- Our tickets/issues have an estimated level of effort, clear acceptance criteria, and an individual or team assignee before being put in a sprint.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
