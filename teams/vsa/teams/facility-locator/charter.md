**Issue Etiquette**

**All issues** have the following
* Title that explains task
* Description with Background 
* Labels - `vsa`, `vsa-facilities`

For an issue to go into the **Ready column**, it must have the following:
* Estimate
* Title that explains task
* Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
* Labels - `vsa`, `vsa-facilities`
* Epic 

Issues are moved into **Current Sprint column** on the first day of the new sprint and will have milestone designation for the relevant sprint:`Facilities Team Sprint xx`
If all sprint work is completed and there is time remaining, additional eligible issues can be identified by the `stretch-goal` label.

The **Validate** column indicates development work is complete and feedback is needed from members of the Facilities team, Accessibility or QA. The appropriate inidivudal(s) should be tagged and assigned. 
* Issues created by individuals outside the team need to be closed by the creator. 

**Estimation**

Estimation is not based on how long something will take to complete, but is rather a combined rating encompassing risk, LOE, and complexity.

1 - Easy task, work is known, can be executed quickly  
2  
3 - Medium task, work is known and can be completed in one sprint  
5 - Work is discussed and planned for, and can be worked   
8 - Work is complex, needs to be discussed, and possibly be broken down into smaller tasks 
13 - Very complex, may take a full sprint or longer 

Team Norms

- Be respectful, both online and off
- Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
- Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
- We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
- Let’s have fun and do great work!

And some logistics:

- Keep as much Slack conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.
- GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to an issue or useful to document, copy them (or link to the thread).
