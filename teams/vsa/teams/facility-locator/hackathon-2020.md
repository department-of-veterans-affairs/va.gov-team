## Design

**Mobile Facility Locator Map**

Problem: Mobile Facility Locator Map is not interactive and missing key information

- How can display useful information for each map location,independently from the List view?
- How can we design this information to be accessible with screen readers?

**When searching for on VA.gov**

Problem: VA.gov often presents more information than a user needs and before they need it. This creates visual problems, information overload and congnitive processing issues, e.g. Covid alerts causing wayfinding obstacles.
- How might reduce cognitive load for our users?
- How might we help focus users to accomplish a task with less noise?

## Product 
**Rethinking the Veteran search experience**

Problem to be solved: The Facility Locator search experience assumes Veterans know what they need and what type of facility can help them. How can we provide a more friendly search experience?
