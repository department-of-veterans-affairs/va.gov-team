# Process for new product landing page

A product landing page is a static landing page that serves as an entry point to a VA tool that isn't an application.

Example: [Manage your VA debt](va.gov/manage-va-debt/)

The sitewide content team builds and manages tool landing pages in the Drupal CMS. Sitewide content works with product teams to create content for these pages that align with our content patterns and the VA.gov content style guide. Product teams are responsible for creating the react widget that serves as the auth/unauth entry into the tool itself. Read this page for instructions on how to work with sitewide content on your tool landing page.

## Step 1: Meet with sitewide content team team to kick off work

We'll ask you these questions during kickoff:

- Who are the SMEs you're working with on this project, and who needs to approve the page?
- What's the estimated launch date?
- Will you be conducting usability testing of the working page?
  - **Note:** Pages created in Drupal don't appear on staging until after they're published to the live site. 
- Will you need a REACT sign-in widget? 
  - **Note:** A Drupal page requires a REACT widget when the product is not launching to 100% of users. Product teams are responsible for creating the REACT sign-widget. The product team provides the sitewide content team with the code to add into Drupal.
- Do you anticipate a need for password-protecting the landing page for UAT testing and/or a phased rollout of the landing page with dynamic content behind a feature toggle?
  - **Note:** Product teams are responsible for creating and monitoring feature toggles. <br> [Read more about the process for dynamic content on Drupal pages](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/processes/dynamic-content-process.md)
