# SME accuracy review process
When you share your silent failure email content with your VA partners or SMEs for approval, you can ask them for an accuracy review of the information (e.g. the recovery steps in the email, phone numbers, or addresses).

In your message to them, note that the content in the email is aligned with our VA.gov plain langauge, accessibility, and content style guidance. And if you worked with someone on the CAIA team, be sure to include them on the VA partners/SME email thread.

**Here's an example of email you can send**

As part of our zero silent failure initiative, we created an email that we'll to send to Veterans if their _((form or application))_ silently fails.

All of the content in this email aligns with our VA.gov plain language, accessibility, and content style guidance.

Can you all do an accuracy review of the information in the email and let us know if there are any inaccuracies? If there aren't any inaccuracies, can you all confirm that we are okay to move forward with this email?
