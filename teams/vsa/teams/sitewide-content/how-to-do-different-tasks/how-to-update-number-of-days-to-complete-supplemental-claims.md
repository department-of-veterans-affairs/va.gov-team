# How to update the number of days to complete Supplemental Claims on VA.gov pages
Every month, the content team needs to update the [Supplemental Claims page](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/supplemental-claim/) in both English and Spanish with a new average time to complete a Supplemental Claim.

To do this, on the first day of the month, email Tanekwa Bournes in VBA communications. She will run a report to get the average number of days for the month. The number we need is listed in the second bullet under "Appeals Modernization Act Claims."

One content team member should input this number into the English page in Drupal. Be sure to change the month in the text as well. A copy editor should review the changes and publish the pages. 

The Spanish copy editor should input this number into the Spanish pages in Drupal. Be sure to change the month in the text as well. A copy editor should review the changes and publish the pages.

Notify Tanekwa once the change is live.
