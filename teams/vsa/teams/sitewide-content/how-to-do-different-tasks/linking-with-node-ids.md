# How to use node IDs to link to other pages within Drupal

When a content author needs to link to another page within Drupal, they must use a Node ID instead of the page's url. This ensures that if the url ever changes, it won't affect the link.

Follow these steps to link to a page using a Node ID.

**If the link is in a rich text field:**
1. Highlight the text to be linked.
2. Select the link-it button.
3. Start typing the H1 of the page to be linked. A list will pop up showing all pages with those words in the H1. 
4. Select the page you want to link to.
5. Select **Save**. 

**If the link is in its own component,** start typing the H1 of the page to be linked where you need to add the url. A list will pop up showing all pages with words in the H1. 

**Note:** Link pages not built in Drupal or not on VA.gov using the full url.
