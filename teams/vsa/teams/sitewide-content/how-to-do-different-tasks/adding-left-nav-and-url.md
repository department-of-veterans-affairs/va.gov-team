## How to set the url for a Drupal page

For root-level and benefit pages, a content author needs to manually add the url. Do this is in the "URL alias" section of the Drupal node. 
The url must start with a / and contain each section after VA.gov. 

For example, the url for [Eligibility for disability benefits](https://www.va.gov/disability/eligibility/) would be written in Drupal as /disability/eligibility

**Note:** In Resources and Support, the url is automatically created from the H1. Content authors should never change this.
