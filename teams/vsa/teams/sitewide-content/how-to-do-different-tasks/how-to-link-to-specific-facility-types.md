# List of facility type links in the facility locator

At times, we want users to be able to search within a specific facility type in the [facility locator tool](https://www.va.gov/find-locations). Use one of these links to pre-fill the specific facility type: 

- [Find a VA health facility](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/?facilityType=health&service)
- [Find a VA health facility that offers COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/?facilityType=health&serviceType=Covid19Vaccine)
- [Find a VA or in-network urgent care facility](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/?facilityType=urgent_care)
- [Find an in-network community pharmacy](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/?facilityType=pharmacy&service)
