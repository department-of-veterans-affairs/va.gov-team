# How to update the content style guide
Sitewide Content is responsible for maintaining and updating the [VA.gov content style guide](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/). Here are directions for doing so.

1. Go to the content style guide folder in the [vets-design-system-documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation) repo.
2. Click on the **src** folder.
3. Click on the **_content-style-guide** folder.
4. Find the folder for the content style guide page you want to work on.
5. Make any changes and save as a branch labeled as something to help identify the work being done. **Note:** Do not make changes to the master branch.
6. Create a PR and assign Beth and/or Danielle to review.
7. Once the PR is approved, merge it. 
8. When the page is live, alert the design system council of the change in a comment in the Zenhub ticket.
