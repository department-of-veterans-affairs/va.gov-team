# How to update the content style guide
Sitewide Content is responsible for maintaining and updating the [VA.gov content style guide](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/). Here are directions for doing so.

1. Go to the content style guide folder in the [vets-design-system-documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation) repo.
2. Click on the **src** folder.
3. Click on the **_content-style-guide** folder.
4. Find the folder for the content style guide page you want to work on. **Note:** If you need to create a new page, select "Add file" and then "Create new file." Type the name of the page, followed by **.md** for "markdown file." (If you're creating a new section, type the section name first followed by the name of the subsection page.)
5. Make any changes and select "Propose new file" with notes to help you identify the work you did. (Or you can save as a branch if you have that option. **Note:** Don't make changes to the master branch.)  
6. Create a Pull Request and assign Beth and/or Danielle to review. And tag Matt Dingee to review.
7. Once the PR is approved, merge it. Or ask Matt Dingee to merge. 
8. When the page is live, alert the design system council of the change in a comment in the Zenhub ticket.

**Note:** If you need to make additional changes before or after you create a pull request, click on "Fork," then "Existing forks." Find the fork with the change. Find your previous commits (changes) by selecting the "Code" tab and then "Branches."
