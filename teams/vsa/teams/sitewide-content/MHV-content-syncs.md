    - **Action item:** Clarify what types of vaccine records appear in the list at the top of the list page. 
    - **Action item:** Add a next step for users to get their self-entered vaccine data. Need to confirm where this will appear in the tool.
 - Discussion: Lab and test records include an "interpretation" field. It's not clear what types of information this field might contain.
