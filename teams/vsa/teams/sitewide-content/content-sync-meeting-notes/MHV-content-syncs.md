**April 26, 2023 — Biweekly sync**
-

**Agenda**

- Safety message on lab & test results — discuss where we need to add this and how to adjust content for this context

**March 15, 2023 — Biweekly sync** 
-

**Agenda**
Downloadable reports screen — working content draft for discussion

Questions for discussion:
- Does organizing by "share" and "get for personal files" make sense? Does Health Summary map neatly to "Share" and BB & complete record to "Get for personal files"?
- If phase 0 BB doesn't include self-entered data or custom date range/domain options, why would Veteran choose this over Health Summary?
- How do we diffentiate the "download records" feature here from the "download" feature on html list and detail screens? Can we talk about completeness or portability of records?

**February 15, 2023 — Biweekly sync**

**Agenda**
- Vaccine reactions data issue and potential content solutions 
- Update on vaccines vs. immunizations label

**February 14, 2023 — Working sync**
- 

**Notes**
- Lexi, Bobby, Laura, Kristin attended
- Discussion: Vaccine reactions may appear in 2 different domains
    - Ngozi has flagged that vaccine adverse reactions may be recorded in at least 4 different fields in MHV data: provider-entered vaccine reactions, provider-entered allergies, self-entered vaccine reactions, and self-entered allergies
    - Existing "disclaimer" content for vaccines encourages users to download allergy records along with vaccine records
    - **Action item:** Add a prompt to the download modal encouraging users to download allergy records with vaccine records
    - **Action item:** Add a note to the "reactions" field in vaccine details about reaction data potentially appearing in allergy domain
- Discussion: Vaccine list includes vaccines users get at pharmacies in community care network. It does not include self-entered vaccines. 
    - **Action item:** Clarify what types of vaccine records appear in the list at the top of the list page. 
    - **Action item:** Add a next step for users to get their self-entered vaccine data. Need to confirm where this will appear in the tool.
 - Discussion: Lab and test records include an "interpretation" field. It's not clear what types of information this field might contain.
    - **Action item:** Laura will reach out to Ngozi for more information about this field.

**February 1, 2023 — Medical records content collaboration kickoff**
-

**Agenda and notes**
- Align on content needs, timing, and process
- Laura shared the medical records content brief shell
    - This will be shared source of truth for content decisions and terms we use in medical records
    - We'll add to this over time, slack Aliyah and Laura with requests to add
- Reviewing the medical records intake request
    - Hi-def designs are done for immunizations/vaccines domain, content is ready for polishing but IA is in flux
    - Designers will start adding content questions and requests to the "For developers and content" panels in sketch files
- Look at key terms for vaccines
    - Vaccines vs. immunizations; Laura showed the preliminary SEO data with mixed results for the 2 terms
    - Discussion: Anne noted that “vaccines” is politicized, Laura noted that “Immunizations” is a much longer word
    - Will be an ongoing content conversation, and content will connect with clinical SMEs on this question
