**Notes**
- We'll be using the identity-research channel for messages re: this meeting moving forward.
- **Reactivation and organic email campaigns:**
     - Laura updated team that Danielle has plans to share new review proccess for all communication items (like email campaigns and other comms initiatives) The goal of this is to have a more clear review proccess in place to support all of the future changes.
- **Creating an account on VA.gov page**
     - We'll need to think through content to address Veterans who can't or don't qualify to create a Login.gov account.  Two sets of information would likely need to exist - **1.** What do I do if I've failed the online proofing **2.** I can't create a Login.gov account and won't ever be able to create a Login.gov account (for example, due to living outside of the U.S.)
     - Dawn sent a question to Login.gov partners to find out if there's a list of all of the scenarios when someone wouldn't qualify to create a Login.gov account.

Attendees: Aliyah, Carl, Laura, Dawn, Joe, Tinu, and Sofia 

**Notes**
- **OOO updates:** Aliyah (July 27 to August 9) Laura (July 28 to July 31) Carl (July 27). Laura will send out a new invite for weekly sign in and identity syncs for July 27 and August 3. Aliyah will also flag that she'll need to send out the agenda.
- Carl shared that he is working on some additional email content - he doesn't anticipate much feedback, as it's similar to previous email content. He'll share this with us next week ahead of his OOO time.
- **Verifying your identity on VA.gov page**
     - We're shifiting plan and will actually move forward with integrating feedback from the identity teams and publish those changes first. Then we'll continue to review additional questions to consider adding to the page with Joe and CORE identity team.
 - **Comms plan from LGA team:** Carl updated that they're working on an internal document that compiles all things sign in /identity in - in one deck. He flagged that their deck will also include imagery guidelines and email template guidance. Sitewide CAIA (content) noted that if they're pulling any content from the content brief or style guide, we recommend that they include a link out to the content brief or style guide, so that we aren't duplicating any of that information and have clarity/one source of truth for the content brief and style guide items. **Action item:** Carl to update us on name of this comms document/plan, as we don't want this to be called a style guide.
 - **Email templates:** Followed up with Carl on question via Slack about the constraints in the Test A email template and if those constraints will be the same for the Test B email. Dawn flagged that the Test A email is a VEO template and they'll continue to use this until they have an OCTO account. **Action item for Aliyah/Laura:** Pass feedback to Dawn about things that we’d suggest changing in the template – pass in a word document. **Action item for Dawn** She'll get answers about whether those are things that we can change.
 - **Privacy and security at VA page:** Laura asked for groups thoughts on how to make updates to this page, as some information is outdated and it only discusses ID.me and not Login.gov. Joe mentioned that the CORE team wrote part of this content in the past. We'll plan to move forward with making updates to this page for a mid September deadline for having content finalized and approved. LGA team will provide notes on content updates and sitewide CAIA (content) will implement. **Action item**: Sitewide CAIA (content) to do a review first and see where we can pull in existin content. Then we'll pass to LGA team to do a pass and provide additional notes on information that we'll need to update.

Attendees: Aliyah, Laura, Carl, and Dawn 

**Notes**
- Dawn (product and delivery manager for Login.gov Adoption team) joined meeting. Aliyah added Dawn to our channel and to future meeting invites.
- We provided updates on DS Logon FAQs and related pages:
    - Style change: John confirmed we should say Login.gov and ID.me meet "modern security standards" rather than "the latest federal security standards." We’ve adjusted this on the Creating an account on VA.gov page.
     - Confirmed with Joe that the verification step doesn't always happen at first sign in with Login.gov or ID.me. It happens the first time you access a page with PII/PHI. So we're adjusting to say "The first time you use your account to manage your VA benefits or information, you'll need to verify your identity"
     - **Continued action:** Aliyah gathering screen captures of all changes (post feedback) and sending another email to John and Tom by EOD Friday 6/23.
 - Reviewed email content from Carl. We'll open a ticket to track notes/feedback points that we discussed.
     -  **Action item:** Carl to confirm details with Joe re: what happens if someone loses access to their MFA device.  
- We chatted about the Medallia survey - Laura mentioned that Danielle is in the proccess of reviewing Medallia data. If there are any takeaways that relate to identity/signing in, we'll be sure to share that out with LGA team.
- We'll review the Verifying your identity on VA.gov page in our next meeting. Joe was OOO today.

   - **Action item:** Carl to share Figma version with us later today

   - Joe previously confirmed that the Experian pin info is no longer accurate. We adjusted question answer to reflect that users would need to unfreeze their credit to use this form of verification. We'll also add a sentence about how to unfreeze credit.

Attendees: Aliyah, Laura, Sofia, Joe, Carl, and Amber

**Notes**
- We started to review the "Verifying your identity on VA.gov" page. We'll update the page with these changes after we publish the Phase 1 changes (DS Logon related updates). We'll continue reviewing this page next week. 
  - We'll plan to remove the question "What's the fastest way to verify my identity online?"
  - We'll plan to remove "without a Premium account" from the question "How do I verify my identity online?"
  - Joe confirmed info for Login.gov online identity verification - if a user doesn't have a phone number in their name, Login.gov can send a letter to their mailing address instead. We added this info as a "Note" at the end of the bulleted list.
  - Joe confirmed info for ID.me online identity verification - if a user can't upload their driver's license or passport, they can answer questions based on private and public data (like a credit report). We added this info as a "Note" at the end of the bulleted list.
  - We discussed adjusting the "Can I verify my identity in person at a VA facility?" to remove "at a VA facility" and change the focus from MHV in person process to Login.gov in person process at USPS. We'll pause on doing this until we get more information about VA requirements around in person verification.
  - **Action item:** Joe will confirm if Experian still offers a PIN if credit is frozen.
- Carl is working on adjusting email content and he should have a draft ready to share with us next week.

Ad hoc sync with Laura, Aliyah, Joe

**Notes**
- Laura and Aliyah walked through first round of DS Logon-related page updates with Joe for accuracy review.
- Joe confirmed that for both Login.gov and ID.me, VA prompts you to verify the first time you try to access or manage your VA benefits or information, not necessarily the first time you sign in. For some people, it's the first sign-in but not always.
- Joe confirmed that "phone number on a phone plan in your name" is required and this is a key piece of information to keep in our pages.
- Joe confirmed that at this time, changing direct deposit is the only action that requires Login.gov or ID.me accounts, but this may expand in future so we can keep wording as "certain tasks and information."
- Joe flagged that we may need content to address certain groups that can't create Login.gov accounts, including those without state ID and those with non-US addresses. We'll follow up on this in next sync.
- Joe shared that at this time, we can't get direct links to the "create" screens in Login.gov or ID.me flows.
  -  Next step: Joe will add technical documentation for this blocker
  -  Next step: Laura/Aliyah will check back in in 90 days to see if there's movement on this issue

**June 1, 2023**

Attendees: Aliyah, Laura, Sofia, Carl, Amber

**Notes**
- Reviewed the Signing in to VA.gov page to make sure it's current. 
- Next step: Adjust "Go to" vs "Visit" link text in last Q&A to be consistent.
- Question: On Creating an account page, different wording in Login and ID sections makes it sound like we prompt to verify at different points in the account creation process — is this accurate? 
  - (Note: We followed up on this in ad hoc with Joe on June 2.)
- Question: On Signing in page, we discuss "confirmation emails" — are these referring to the step in the process where you confirm your email address, or the email we send at the end of the process to confirm that you successfully created an account?
  - Next step: Follow up on this in next sync.
