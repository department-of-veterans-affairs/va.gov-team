Before publishing any page on VA.gov confirm the following:</br>
- [ ] All links are working
- [ ] Phone numbers are in aria labels
- [ ] Heirarchy of headings is correct (H1 to H2 to H3--levels shouldn't be skipped)
- [ ] Node IDs are used for links within Drupal
- [ ] We aren't using sighted language ("view," "see," "look"). These should be replaced with a word that's inclusive of our users with screen readers ("check," "go to")
- [ ] If publishing a brand-new page, confirm the left nav and url are set up correctly (if the page is a child page, the section needs to be the same as the parent page in order for the left nav to show)
- [ ] All apostrophes and quotation marks should be curly
- [ ] There are no changes to the page that shouldn't be published. Check the revision log to confirm that any previous changes made to the page can also be published

Before publishing a Resources and Support article make sure these steps are also complete:</br>
- [ ] H2s are within the 70-character limit
- [ ] Related links are on page and make sense (i.e., they’re actually related to the article—rather than “something you may also be interested in”—and there isn’t an obvious one that’s missing
- [ ] Action link wording matches ones on other pages that use same link
- [ ] If linking off of VA.gov, make sure that's indicated with the words in the label or button
- [ ] Correct article category is selected
- [ ] Correct benefit hub contacts are selected
- [ ] Appropriate audience and topic tags are selected
- [ ] Action links repeat on the bottom if a long article
- [ ] **For single Q&A:** Standalone button is checked
- [ ] **For multiple FAQs:** First publish each Q&A on its own (make sure standalone button is not checked) and then publish the multiple FAQ
- [ ] **Once published:** Add article to the R&S landing page either in a new hub section or to one that already exists. If there are already more than 5 articles in that hub, you do not need to add it unless you want it to replace another article already on the page.
- [ ] **Once published:** If the article is the sixth one in a hub to be published, add the "Go to all articles" link at the bottom of the hub section on the landing page.
- [ ] **Once published:** Add the new article and its CTA button wording to our [Github file of button labels](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/rs-cta-button-audit.md).
- [ ] **Once published:** Add the new article to our [Github file of R&S articles](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/resources-and-support-article-list.md).
