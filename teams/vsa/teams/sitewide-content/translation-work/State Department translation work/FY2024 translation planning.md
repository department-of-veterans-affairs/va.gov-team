## Forms
We'll also budget for translating up to 8 new forms. We're basing the budget numbers on prioritizing translating health care and disability forms as they're the top 10 pdf forms downloaded by people with their browsers set to Spanish. However, some of these online forms are currently being reworked in English and others are not yet available. Forms translation work may shift.

## Language assistance and resources page translated into 10 additional languages
To support VA's commitment to the fact sheet law, we'll aim to translate our language assistance and resources page into 10 additional languages. This word count is based on the Spanish page with a 10% buffer because other languages tend to be more expensive to translate. (Word count: 11,935)

Total word count: **61,723**
