# Process for updating COVID-19 pages
**Note:** This process is now updated with the addition of a Spanish copy editor on our team and fewer COVID pages on the site. 

This is the process to follow when we have updates to any of our COVID-19 pages that we also have translated content for:
- [Coronavirus FAQs](https://www.va.gov/coronavirus-veteran-frequently-asked-questions)
- [COVID-19 vaccines at VA](https://www.va.gov/health-care/covid-19-vaccine/)
- [About COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.va.gov/health-care/covid-19-vaccine/about-covid-19-vaccine/)
- [How to get your COVID-19 vaccine records online](https://www.va.gov/health-care/covid-19-vaccine/vaccine-record/)

1. Sometimes Danielle updates the content. Other times she will forward the changes to the content team to make the needed updates in Drupal.
2. Danielle or the content editor sends the updates out for SME approval as a Drupal Preview link or screen shots in an email, depending on how many changes were made.
3. Once approved, the content editor makes any necessary changes and the copy editor does a final read and publishes the page.
4. The PM creates tickets for the translation work. There should be a separate ticket for Spanish and Tagalog since the translation often comes back at different times. 
5. Once the page is published, the Spanish copy editor creates a Word doc to send to the translation team and provides the link to the page with updates. For the Word doc, copy the paragraph that contains updates and be sure to include any H2s or H3s that will help identify where on the page the changes are. Highlight each full sentence that's changing.
6. Randi sends the Word doc to the translation team and asks for translations in both Spanish and Tagalog.
7. Once the translation comes back, the Spanish copy editor inputs the changes to both the Spanish and Tagalog pages. If there are any missing translations, the Spanish copy editor includes it in their notes in the Github ticket during the pass off for copy edit. If the missing translations are minor, the Spanish copy editor can translate the Spanish text or use Google translate to translate the text, but should also note it in the Github ticket so that Randi can contact the translation team for a proper translation.
9. The copy editor reviews these pages, making sure all the translated content has been added to the page. They also review the page for any errors with spacing, capitalization, and punctuation and make sure all links work. 
10. The copy editor publishes the page.
