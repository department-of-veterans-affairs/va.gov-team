# Process for updating COVID-19 pages

This is the process to follow when we have updates to any of our COVID-19 pages that we also have translated content for:
- [Coronavirus FAQs](https://www.va.gov/coronavirus-veteran-frequently-asked-questions)
- [COVID-19 vaccines at VA](https://www.va.gov/health-care/covid-19-vaccine/)
- [About COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.va.gov/health-care/covid-19-vaccine/about-covid-19-vaccine/)
- [COVID-19 booster shots and additional doses](https://www.va.gov/health-care/covid-19-vaccine/booster-shots-and-additional-doses/)
- [How to get your COVID-19 vaccine records online](https://www.va.gov/health-care/covid-19-vaccine/vaccine-record/)

1. Danielle updates the content. Depending on the updates and how quickly they need to be published, her changes can be in a Word doc or in a Drupal page.
2. The copy editor does a copy edit of the content (either in a Word doc or in Drupal).
3. Danielle sends the updates for JTF approval.
4. Once approved, Danielle makes any necessary changes and the copy editor does a final read and publishes the page.
5. Once the page is published, the copy editor creates a Word doc to send to the translation team and provides the link to the page with updates. For the Word doc, copy the paragraph that contains updates and be sure to include any H2s or H3s that will help identify where on the page the changes are. Highlight each full sentence that's changing.
6. The copy editor sends the Word doc to the translation team and asks for translations in both Spanish and Tagalog.
7. The copy editor begins to track the work in the [COVID-19 translation process tracker](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/translation-work/translation-process-tracker.md).
8. Once the translation comes back, a content team member inputs the changes to both the Spanish and Tagalog pages. If there are any missing translations, the content team member includes it in their notes in the Github ticket during the pass off for copy edit. If the missing translations are minor, the content team member can use Google translate to translate the text, but should also note it in the Github ticket so that the copy editor can contact the translation team for a proper translation.
9. The copy editor reviews these pages, making sure all the translated content has been added to the page. They also review the page for any errors with spacing, capitalization, and punctuation and makes sure all links work. 
10. The copy editor publishes the page.
11. Once the page is live, the copy editor sends links of the live pages to the volunteer translation team, and points out where on the page changes were made. The volunteer translation team reviews the content to make sure there are no egregious errors and the content matches the meaning on the English page. 
12. A content team member enters any changes from the volunteer translation team's review.
13. The copy editor reviews the changes and publishes the page.
