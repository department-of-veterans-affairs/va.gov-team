**Before publishing any page on VA.gov complete these tasks:**</br>
- [ ] Check all links to confirm they work and point to the intended page
- [ ] Confirm all phone numbers are in [aria labels](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/dates-and-numbers#phone-numbers)
- [ ] Confirm that the heirarchy of headings is correct (H1 to H2 to H3--levels shouldn't be skipped)
- [ ] Check that we used Node IDs to create links within Drupal instead of pasting the URL
- [ ] Replace any sighted language ("view," "see," "look") with a word that's inclusive of our screen reader users ("check," "go to," "review")
- [ ] If publishing a brand-new page, confirm the left nav and url are set up correctly (if the page is a child page, the section needs to be the same as the parent page in order for the left nav to show)
- [ ] Make sure all apostrophes and quotation marks are curly not straight
- [ ] Confirm that there are no updates in draft by other content authors that aren't ready to be published. Check the revision log and then confirm with the content author who made the previous edits that the page is ready to publish

**Before publishing a Resources and Support article, make sure to also complete these tasks:**</br>
- [ ] Confirm H2s, H3s, and H4s are within the 70-character limit
- [ ] Confirm related links have been added to the file and make sense for the topic of the page (i.e., they’re actually related to the article—rather than “something you may also be interested in”—and there isn’t an obvious one that’s missing) 
- [ ] Determine if this new article should be added as a related link on any live articles 
- [ ] Make sure the wording for the action link (call to action link text) matches other pages that use the same link
- [ ] If linking off of VA.gov, make sure the words in the label or button indicate to the user that they're leaving VA.gov
- [ ] Make sure the correct primary article category and additional article categories are selected in the Drupal file
- [ ] Confirm the correct benefit hub contacts are selected in the Drupal file
- [ ] Confirm that the appropriate audience and topic tags are selected in the Drupal file
- [ ] Confirm action links repeat on the bottom of the page if it's a long article
- [ ] **For a single Q&A:** Check the standalone button
- [ ] **For multiple FAQs:** First publish each single Q&A and then publish the multiple FAQ

**After publishing a Resources and Support article, make sure to complete these steps:**</br>
- [ ] Add the article to the R&S landing page in the correct hub. If there are already more than 5 articles in that hub, you don't need to add it unless you want it to replace another article already on the page.
- [ ] If the article is the sixth one in a hub to be published, add the "Go to all articles" link at the bottom of the hub section on the landing page.
- [ ] Add the new article and its action link wording to our [Github file of button labels](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/rs-cta-button-audit.md).
- [ ] Add the new article to our [Github file of R&S articles](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/resources-and-support-article-list.md).
- [ ] Notify the Content Center Support team in their Slack channel (#vsp-contact-center-support) that we've published a new article. Provide the link and a few details about the article. It may be helpful to them for either communicating with Veterans or researching questions themselves.
