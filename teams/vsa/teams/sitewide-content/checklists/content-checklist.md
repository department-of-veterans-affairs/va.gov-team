# Content standards checklist

This checklist is for content authors working in Drupal to use when creating a new page in our resources and support section. Content authors should complete this checklist to make sure their new content aligns with the standards in the VA.gov style guide. 

**Note:** The content team will confirm that the items on this list have been accounted for before publishing. If one of these standards hasn't been met, they'll make any necessary changes or edits.

### Accessibility standards

- [ ] If your link or button will take the user off VA.gov, confirm that the text for the link or button contains a purpose and a target. The user should be able to tell from the link or button text what the call to action is (the purpose) and where they will end up if they click on the link (the target). The following link is an example of this: [Read more about making links accessible on AccessibilityOz](https://www.accessibilityoz.com/2014/02/links-and-accessibility/) 
- [ ] Confirm all phone numbers are in aria labels. [Learn how to code numbers with aria labels](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/dates-and-numbers#phone-numbers)
- [ ] Confirm that the heirarchy of section and subsection titles is correct (H1 to H2 to H3—levels shouldn't be skipped). [Learn more about section titles](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/page-titles-and-section-titles) 

### Link checks

- [ ] Confirm that links work (aren't broken--no error message) and point to the intended page (you pasted in the correct URL or chose the correct node ID).
- [ ] Confirm all link text is 100 characters or less.
- [ ] Check that you've selected a node ID for all links pointing to VA.gov (internal) pages. Only paste in a URL if the page you're linking to does not live in our CMS (isn't one of our modernized pages).

### Standards for Resources and Support articles

- [ ] Character limit for subheads: Confirm H2s, H3s, and H4s are within the 70-character limit.
- [ ] Related links: Confirm that you've added appropriate related links to the file (they should truly be related to the article—rather than “something the reader may also be interested in”).
- [ ] Cross linking: Determine if this new article should be added as a related link on any live articles. (Do you want to drive users to this page from elsewhere on VA.gov?)
- [ ] Call to action (CTA): When considering the wording for your CTA text, check to see if a label is already in use for this CTA on VA.gov. Reuse existing CTA text when possible. [Check the master list of labels for buttons and action links](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/resources-and-support/rs-cta-button-audit.md)
- [ ] Alternative text ("alt text") for any screen shots on the page: Confirm that screen shots or other images have alt text that describes the image. Screen readers will read this text to the user, and search engines use it to assess the purpose of the page. [Learn how to write alt text on WebAIM](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/)

#### Drupal checks
- [ ] Check that the correct primary article category and additional article categories are selected
- [ ] Check that the correct benefit hub contacts are selected
- [ ] Check that appropriate audience and topic tags are selected
- [ ] If the article is long, check the "Repeat CTA buttons" box to display the action link(s) at both the top and bottom of the page
- [ ] If you want a single Q&A to appear as a stand-alone article and not just as part of a multiple FAQ, click "Enable standalone Resources and support page for this Q&A."
