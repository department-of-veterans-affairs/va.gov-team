# Translation pre-publish checklist #

## Content checks ##

- [ ] Compare translated version against the English version to make sure all the paragraphs are accounted for. Look for any missing headers, sentences, or bullet list items.
- [ ] If translating a page that is getting frequent updates and we don't have the latest version available, add an alert that explains we're awaiting translation. **Example:** [This COVID alert in Spanish](https://prod.cms.va.gov/admin/content/block/269?destination=/admin/content/alerts)

## Formatting checks ##

- [ ]    Confirm all phone numbers are in aria labels. [Learn how to code numbers with aria labels](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/dates-and-numbers#phone-numbers)
- [ ]    Confirm that the hierarchy of section and subsection titles is correct (H1 to H2 to H3---levels shouldn't be skipped). [Learn more about section titles](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/page-titles-and-section-titles)
- [ ]    Make sure all the styling is consistent between the English version and the translated versions, like bolded text, action links, bullets, and spacing.
- [ ]    Make sure there are no extra line breaks between content blocks.

## Link checks ##

- [ ]    Confirm that links work (aren't broken---no error message) and point to the intended page (you pasted in the correct URL or chose the correct node ID).
- [ ]    Check that you've selected a node ID for all links pointing to VA.gov (internal) pages. Only paste in a URL if the page you're linking to doesn't live in our CMS (isn't one of our modernized pages). [Learn how to add node IDs in Drupal](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/how-to-do-different-tasks/linking-with-node-ids.md)
- [ ]    Check to make sure all links that direct to English pages are noted. For example, the link has "(en ingl√©s)" at the end for Spanish pages and "(sa English)" at the end for Tagalog pages.
- [ ]    Compare all links against [list of translated pages](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/translation-work/list%20of%20translated%20pages.md). Link to translated pages when possible. **Example:** If you're publishing a Spanish page that links to Supplemental Claims, make sure to link to our [Spanish version of Supplemental Claims](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/supplemental-claim-esp/).
- [ ]    Change the URL to match our pattern for translated pages by adding **-esp/** or **-tag/** at the end of the English URL. (Example: /health-care/covid-19-vaccine-esp/vaccine-record-esp/)

## Post-publish steps ## 

- [ ]    When publishing a new translated page, [add it to our list of translated pages on VA.gov](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/translation-work/list%20of%20translated%20pages.md).
- [ ]    Confirm with the translation manager on OCTO that the page is ready for QA from the translation service.
- [ ]    Once the page gets cleared from QA, coordinate with the translation manager on OCTO to get the language toggle and left nav set up. We'll need to create a ticket for Public Websites to implement.
- [ ]    If publishing a translated page for the Resources and support section, [add the new article to our Github file of R&S articles](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/resources-and-support/resources-and-support-article-list.md).
