# Before sending Vet Center pages for final review: 

**Copyediting and common errors**

- [ ] Check for extra spaces between words

- [ ] Check for sentence casing

**Word choice** 

- [ ] Check the site uses “we” instead of repeating name of Vet Center throughout
- [ ] Confirm “service members” is used when we say “Veterans” (if appropriate)
- [ ] Use “counselors” instead of “clinicians”
- [ ] Check to see that “and other community partners” follows “We refer to VA…” whenever possible. (Not all Vet Center clients are eligible for VA health benefits.)
- [ ] Avoid words like “victims” or “survivors”

**Links and style guide alignment**

- [ ] Confirm dates and times follow VA style guide
- [ ] Confirm street addresses follow VA style guide
- [ ] Check that the Veterans Crisis Line is using the 3-digit number (this applies after 7/16)

**Content flags**
