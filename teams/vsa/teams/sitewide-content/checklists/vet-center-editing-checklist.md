# Before sending Vet Center pages for final review: 

**Copyediting and common errors**

- [ ] Check for extra spaces between words
- [ ] Check for extra line spaces at end of content blocks
- [ ] Check for sentence casing
- [ ] Change straight quotes to curly quotes
- [ ] Confirm Veterans is capitalized
- [ ] Remove any duplicative national content

**Word choice** 

- [ ] Check the site uses “we” instead of repeating name of Vet Center throughout
- [ ] Confirm “service members” is used when we say “Veterans” (if appropriate)
- [ ] Use “counselors” instead of “clinicians”
- [ ] Check to see that “and other community partners” follows “We refer to VA…” whenever possible. (Not all Vet Center clients are eligible for VA health benefits.)
- [ ] Avoid words like “victims” or “survivors”

**Links and style guide alignment**

- [ ] Confirm all links are working
- [ ] Make sure link text starts with an action word (unless it’s in a list of referrals or partners) and clearly conveys what information it links out to 
- [ ] Confirm dates and times follow VA style guide
- [ ] Confirm street addresses follow VA style guide
- [ ] Check that the Veterans Crisis Line is using the 3-digit number (this applies after 7/16)

**Content flags**
- [ ] Avoid specific names or emails 
- [ ] Don’t say “we serve all who served” or other eligibility language outside of what’s in the national content
- [ ] Events or activities that imply a fee

**Locations and contact information**
- [ ] Has at least one CAP or the Vet Center informed us they don’t have CAPs

**All services (especially PTSD and MST)**

- [ ] Be sure specific groups, therapies, counseling for that Vet Center are listed
- [ ] Use full name and abbreviation for therapies (CBT, EMDR, PE)
