## Why we’re here 

### North Stars
Increase the use of self-service tools. <br>
Consistently deliver a satisfying, reliable, and secure online experience. 

### Team mission statement
To build trust by giving all Veterans and their family members the information they need to understand, access, and manage their VA benefits and services--using a single, plain-language VA.gov voice.
 
We ensure that the content and voice of VA.gov is:
- Clear
- Accurate
- Consistent
- Plain language
- Compassionate
- Equitable
- Authoritative
- Accessible
- Findable

### Product portfolio
- Global unauthenticated content (including homepage, tool pages, benefit hubs, resources & support, and other unauthenticated content) 
- Content within VA.gov products and tools (we collaborate with product teams to ensure a consistent voice and clear, plain language content across the site) 
 
### Responsibilities
**Content strategy:** Work with product teams and UX/IA to organize, label, and manage content. 

**Content research:** Conduct research around content comprehension, empathy, and organization. Work with product team researchers to include content goals in research sessions. Analyze and compile findings for broader content decisions. 

**Content design:** Write, edit, and design new content across the VA.gov experience.

**Content updates and maintenance:** Collaborate with program offices to write, edit, and design content for updates to existing VA.gov pages. 

**Content planning and tracking:** Prioritize for planned content publishing. We use ticketing in zenhub to track work, both planned and unplanned.

**Content standards:** Enforce accuracy, plain language, and content style guide standards. Ensure that the VA.gov voice, style, and tone aligns across the Veteran experience. 

**Content community of practice:** Guide and support content creators across the VA.gov ecosystem. Develop and run training workshops and materials. Hold content support office hours. 
 
### Roadmap 

- Health modernization content 
- Tier 1 content refresh/build out R&S 
- Continued legacy content migration (debt, community care, caregiver) 
- Continued legacy content migration holdover: complete rewrite of life insurance and education hubs 

DONE in 2021:
- Create new sitewide content service model to support product teams. 
- Migrate current and relevant Veteran-facing FAQs from IRIS to VA.gov (R&S): This work is ongoing as we may return to develop more articles as we have time. But the initial set of articles are live.

### How we work 
**Slack channel:** va-sitewide-content-ia <br> 
**What this channel should be used for:**  
- General content questions from designers, product managers, and others 
- Product-specific content questions that come up in between office hours 
- Alert sitewide content team to a content intake request 

**Office hours:** This a weekly opportunity for designers and product managers to get input from the Digital Experience content leads at any stage of product development. Collaboration on content needs will range from content strategy to help with specific messaging. Office hours can be used to work through issues that have come up in the designers’ suite meetings.

ON HOLD WITH BRIEFS UNTIL PRODUCT WORK TRANSITIONS AWAY FROM OCTO PRODUCT OWNERS TO CONTENT TEAM <br>
**[Content Brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/content-brief-template.md):** This is a support document that's specific to each product. It lives in github and is accessible to anyone who needs to reference it. The sitewide content team is responsible for creating it and keeping it updated as guidance evolves, requirements come out of stakeholder meetings, and research findings inform the content/messaging approach.

**[Intake form](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=Sitewide+Content%2C+RLHecht&labels=sitewide+content%2C+sitewide+content-product+support&template=sitewide-content-intake-form.md&title=%3CType+of+Request%3E+from+%3CTeam%3E):** Open a ticket to request specific content support.
