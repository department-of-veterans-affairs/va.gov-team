# Content migration roadmap

## Goal

In 2018, VA consolidated and migrated the top core Veteran benefit content to the modernized VA.gov environment. From 2019 through 2022, VA has continued to consolidate and migrate content, including:

- Debt management content for Veterans and other beneficiaries
- Disability compensation rates
- Top IRIS questions
- VA medical center content

However, a significant amount of content for different audiences remains in legacy environments. To move migration forward, OCTO and our partners across VA must align on a roadmap for migration.

## Migration processes

Content migration requires collaboration between OCTO and each administration's digital media team and relevant program office. 

Here is the process for migration:
1. **Agreement on timing:** OCTO, digital media team, and program office agree to project kick off date.
2. **Kickoff meeting:** OCTO content and IA team, digital media team, and program office meet to kick off the effort.
3. **Content audit:** The groups work together to populate a content audit template for shared alignment on all affected content. Groups meet regularly (weekly or biweekly) to discuss and make decisions on what content will migrate to Drupal (and where it will go), what content may need another home, and what content can be deprecated.
4. **Content writing and design:** The groups work together to create content that aligns with VA.gov modernized templates, content style guide, and plain language standards.
