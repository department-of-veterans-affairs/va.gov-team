# Ongoing content audit for Drupal static content pages

## Process

### 2 weeks prior to start of audit

### 1 week prior to start of audit
- [ ] Create an easy-to-use collaborative audit document customized for SMEs' use and easy collaboration.
- [ ] Send SMEs collaborative audit document with instructions.
- [ ] Set up an audit kickoff call.

### Audit time period (2.5 weeks)
- [ ] Hold audit kickoff call with SMEs to go over document.
- [ ] Conduct OCTO audit of content.
- [ ] 1 week into audit time period: Check in with SMEs on status and any questions.

### Post-audit
- [ ] Hold meeting with SMEs to go over audit findings, next steps, and prioritization of associated work.
- [ ] Create backlog tickets for associated work and determine timing for implementation. 
- [ ] Update roadmap with any upcoming changes, programs, or products within next year.
- [ ] Schedule quarterly check-in meetings with SMEs to stay aligned on roadmaps.
- [ ] Update all relevant content standards documentation and share all content changes with other teams (platform governance, chatbot, mobile app, etc.) for awareness and alignment.

## Request for SMEs

SMEs to review all identified content for the following:
- Accuracy and timeliness of information
- Any gaps in information
- Any upcoming changes we should anticipate for this content over the next year (based on upcoming legislative, regulation, or programmatic changes)
- Any new programs or products that we should anticipate adding content for, or entry points to, within the next year

## OCTO audit

The OCTO audit will identify and create tickets to fix issues with these items for each content page:

### OCTO content lead checks and tasks

- The intro paragraph has no more than 2 to 4 sentences, is within 200 to 400 characters with spaces, and follows our pattern and style for intros (short sentences, paragraph ends with a CTA, etc.).
- Assess the content in the blue box and remove content that isn't related to eligibility. Move non-eligiblity content to Q&As under the featured content blue box or incorporate as appropriate otherwise on the page.
- Add standards checks as appropriate for each hub (will vary by hub)
- Relevant terms from page are in content brief
- Backlog work is captured in a backlog ticket
- Record of the audit for each webpage is in the github folder for that calendar year within the audit folder.

### Copyeditor checks and tasks, in addition to editing OCTO edits

- Header levels are hierarchical
- The page has no broken links
- Text links have purpose and target
- The content is free of ability-focused language (view, walk, see, hear) Note: We allow "show" and "appear" when talking about evidence related to disability compensation.
- Flesch-Kincaid before and after grade level (add to record of audit for each webpage)

**Note:** Run and record grade level checks of each page for documentation. Flag any pages with higher than 8th grade scores (with no content prep) and put in backlog for further review.
