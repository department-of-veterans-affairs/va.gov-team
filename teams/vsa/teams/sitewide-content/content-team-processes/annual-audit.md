## Request for SMEs

SMEs to review all identified content for the following:
- Accuracy and timeliness of information
- Any gaps in information
- Any upcoming changes we should anticipate for this content over the next year (based on upcoming legislative, regulation, or programmatic changes)
- Any new programs or products that we should anticipate adding content for, or entry points to, within the next year

## OCTO audit

The OCTO audit will identify and create tickets to fix issues with these items for each content page:

### URL
- [ ] URL follows VA.gov URL standards
- [ ] URL correctly represents the placement of the page in the IA of the site
- [ ] URL includes primary keyword and aligns with the H1

### Breadcrumb

- [ ] The page displays a breadcrumb
- [ ] The breadcrumb represents the same hierarchy as the URL
- [ ] The breadcrumb segments match the H1 of the pages in the navigation path exactly
- [ ] **If the page is translated,** the translated segments of the breadcrumb have appropriate tags

### Secondary navigation (where applicable)

- [ ] The page is displayed as an option within the secondary nav
- [ ] The placement of the option in the secondary nav represents the same hierarchy as the URL
- [ ] **If the page is translated,** the translated segments of the navigation have appropriate tags

### On this page component

- [ ] The page has an "on this page" component if appropriate

### Content on page

- [ ] Header levels are hierarchical
- [ ] The page has no broken links
- [ ] The intro paragraph has no more than 2 to 4 sentences and is within 200 to 400 characters with spaces
- [ ] The content is free of ability-focused language
- [ ] Content aligns with relevant content brief (create or update brief as needed)

**Note:** Run and record grade level checks of each page for documentation. Flag any pages with higher than 8th grade scores (with no content prep) and put in backlog for further review.
