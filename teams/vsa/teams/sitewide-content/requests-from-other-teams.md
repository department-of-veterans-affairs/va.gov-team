# This document serves as a guide for how Sitewide Content handles various requests from different teams/stakeholders

## VBA maintenance requests
### Assessment criteria for requests to add content or links on VA.gov

Summary: There are two general types of requests we get. 
-	To add content to an existing page
-	To link to an external webpage or PDF

Is it Veteran facing? 
- What’s the overall value to Veterans? (Of adding this content or linking to a guide that’s a pdf)
- Are we providing them with new or updated information, or is the information already captured on our VA.gov page?

What's the reason for adding it? 
- Does it solve an identified problem? (For instance, Veterans are confused about something / there’ve been changes to a program or act. Example: The Blue Water Navy Act changed the rules for VA-backed home loans in that a certain category of Veteran would no longer have home loan limits.

Does it add value to the user experience on the existing webpage in question, taking into consideration what's already on that static page--or is it duplicative? 
- We don’t want to present information on our page, and then link to an asset that simply repeats the information in a new format. 
- If some but not all of the content in an asset like a guide or fact sheet is new and would be helpful to a Veteran, rather than linking to the guide, we consider whether we might add that new information to the page.
