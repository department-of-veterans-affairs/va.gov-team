## Analysis
[Resources and support ratings spreadsheet](https://dvagov-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/randi_hecht_va_gov/Documents/Documents/Analytics/Resources%20and%20support%20ratings%20tracking%20June%202025.csv?d=wa1bebb0b794548e9a42438242179cc33&csf=1&web=1&e=7azDhc)

- We continue to not meet our goal of a 75% good rating for resources and support pages, with an average rating this month of 66%. 
- Performance isn't as high when broken down to individual pages:
  - 17% of pages are scoring at 90% or higher "good"
  - 47% of pages are meeting our goal of 75% or higher "good," while 52% of pages are scoring 70% or higher
  - 29% of pages are scoring at less than 50% "good," with 4% scoring at less than 10% "good" 
- Sign-in related pages continue to score poorly. We still believe this is more about the process than the content on the pages, but we'll continue to monitor Medallia feedback to learn if there are any changes we can make to improve these pages.
- Pages connected to concerns and complaints at VA health facilities and community care providers were 2 of the 5 lowest scoring pages this month. We'll review the Medallia feedback to determine if this is related to content on the page. In the middle of this month, we launched a new more detailed page with information about reporting concerns about community providers. This is not tracked this month but we will review next month to see if the ratings change at all.
- We had a high number of responses (2,813) for the page "How to renew a VA prescription" and only a 44% good rating. We'll review Medallia feedback to determine if there's a common issue users are mentioning.
