## Problem Statement

Although the questions presented through the user interview process are the same questions that are found on VA Form 21-0781 and 0781a, asking the Veteran to relive some of the most traumatic events of their life can be problematic when they aren’t also supported by clinical staff or personnel that can address issues that arise while recounting these events. 


### Evidence of the problem
One of the challenges that we’ve encountered/witnessed through usability testing with Veterans and Service members is that the type of questions we’re currently asking in the user interview process can be triggering for Veterans. 

## Desired User Outcomes
- Removal of triggering questions.
- Veterans should be able to complete and submit their disability claims without delay and triggering known stressors. 

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Incomplete / unavailable data, sufficient to pre-populate form.

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Improve Veterans’ experience filing PTSD claims through our VA.gov claim submission product.

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Insufficient data to pass along to claims adjudicators.

## Hypothesis
 - Have confirmed availability of VADIR data. Current solution: eMIS. Solution under development by VA Profile team expected late summer/early fall. We should be able to access the eMIS data now and switch over to the new solution when it becomes available. We have engaged with the correct contacts on each team.

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
*Which of your product's existing KPIs will you look at to understand if your solution is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about undesired outcome? Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports?*

- Number of submissions | 10% increase | *[Link to data source](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-event-events/a50123418w177519031p176188361/_u.date00=20210101&_u.date01=20210222&explorer-segmentExplorer.segmentId=analytics.eventLabel&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.filter=disability-526EZ--submission-successful&explorer-graphOptions.selected=analytics.nthWeek/)*
  - Research and analytics suggests form drop-off where the PTSD related questions are asked.

## Assumptions/Risks
*Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>1</sup>.*

- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it): 
  - Pre-launch usability testing
  - Pre-launch user acceptance testing
  - Post-launch usability testing
- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - Simplified, shorter form, gain customer trust as we will demonstrate knowledge of their service, improved customer satisfaction
  - Form time completion should be reduced
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/skills): 
  - Dependency upon availability of VADIR data
- **Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact): 
  - Initial discussions indicate data is available, integration discussions pending. 

## Discovery
*Describe the experiments, prototypes, etc. you'll develop to efficiently validate your assumptions.*

- Begin with prototype of new language and pages
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

## Prioritization
*Describe and prioritize the competing hypotheses the team develops as a result of discovery accounting for effort, impact, value.*
