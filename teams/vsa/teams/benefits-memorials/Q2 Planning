## Metrics



## Goals
- Release MVP - NOD.  
- Original claims form 526ez - Iteration 3 (research and design work first, while Anna (and new engineer) tackle bugs). We prioritize from there.
  -  Enhancements (based on Kevin’s data, research starting now)
  - Look for errors
  - Error remediation
    - Bugs in sentry
    - Veteran survey (research?)
    - Call center feedback (we need to establish methodology for handling call center issues)
  - 2 forms that aren’t launched
  - PTSD issue implementation
  - Form changes
  - Accessibility issues. 
  
- Claims Status Tool (3rd quarter) (mobile team working on this for mobile devices)
  - Another team working on metrics
  - Research has revealed some bugs and issues we want to address 
  - Data integrity
  - Content / messaging
  - Improving user experience (full redesign or additional data availability)
  - We need good test users
  - Data sources / discovery
    - We pull from 2 APIs and only 1 is documented
    - Take sample of prod data
    - Have Matt lean on EVSS to document API (Anna providing url)
    - End to end test systems - Cypress transition. 
    
- Letters
  - Assess errors. 

- Burials
  - Assess errors. 

- Documentation (at the end of NOD and post to GitHub)
    - Why we made decisions. 
    
- Outliers: 
- HLR iteration 2
    - Test users, make decision dates dynamic (currently set to expire in a year)
    - Accessibility issues
    - Supporting Legacy Appeal Opt-ins. 
    
- NOD iteration 2
    - Uploading supporting evidence after the fact. 
    
# Celebrate releases!!!! 


# Constraints
1. Staffing
2. Contact center support
  - Initially, dedicate a month to addressing issues and hopefully this will reduce
  - Anna can train other engineers and we will then rotate support
  - Have contact center add labels to tickets (1 ticket per issue)
