## Disability compensation (Form 21-526EZ)

Form 526 is in production. A Veteran can file for:
- Original claim
- Claim increase
- Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD)

There are numerous sub-forms:
- Intent to file (Form 20-0966) - automatically filed when 526 is started
- PTSD support (Form 781/781a) - for new PTSD submissions
- Disclose information to the VA (Form 4142)
- Unemployability benefits (Form 8940) - **Not yet in production**
- Employment information (Form 4192) - **Not yet in production**

### Monitoring

- [Google Analytics successful submissions](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-event-events/a50123418w177519031p176188361/_u.dateOption=last30days&explorer-segmentExplorer.segmentId=analytics.eventLabel&_r.drilldown=analytics.eventLabel:disability-526EZ--submission-successful/)
- [Sentry error logs](http://sentry.vfs.va.gov/organizations/vsp/issues/?environment=production&query=is%3Aunresolved+source%3A526EZ-all-claims&sort=priority&statsPeriod=14d) (socks proxy required) - look in the "additional data" body for a list of errors
- [Graphana](https://grafana.vfs.va.gov/d/000000066/form-526-disability-compensation?orgId=1) (socks proxy required)
- [DOMO dashboard](https://va-gov.domo.com/auth/index?redirectUrl=%2Fpage%2F447193050)

### Submission errors

Form 526 has around a 97% successful submission rate. The unsuccessful submissions fall into these areas:

- Most errors are "PIF in use".
  - These issues can only be resolved upstream of EVSS.
  - Our backend recently starting sending out emails to Veterans encountering this problem
  - Coordination with Lighthouse to allow creating a PDF that the Veteran can print and mail is in the works.
- [EVSS validation rules](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/support/Form526%20Validation%20Rules.docx) have not been fully implemented on the frontend, but may not need to be because of schema restrictions. There is also a [EVSS validation rules Google doc with comments](https://docs.google.com/document/d/141qH9dh5M6C_JxRxkSdS8hygxzi46LlqZh9scOgS5sA/edit) which may be helpful is tracking down any new issues that show up.
- JavaScript errors that pop up occasionally.
  - These are logged in [Sentry error logs](http://sentry.vfs.va.gov/organizations/vsp/issues/?environment=production&query=is%3Aunresolved+source%3A526EZ-all-claims&sort=priority&statsPeriod=14d) (socks proxy required)
  - Some of these issues may be external to Form 526, e.g. using an outdated operating system or browser
  - Sentry events may include an `account_uuid` (not considered PII since it is internal) which can be used to obtain the Veteran's save-in-progress data for testing (this form data is PII, so handle appropriately)
- Incomplete or invalid form data preventing submission:
    - A Veteran may not be able to submit if changes were made on the review & submit page, but required followup questions were not filled in. This is discussed in the "Add PTSD to review & submit" ticket ([#14014](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/14014)), but form 526 is unique, right now, in that is has the `showReviewErrors` set to `true` and values set in the `reviewErrors` object within the form config. This adds validation error links to the alert shown when the Veteran attempts to submit - see [pull request #16431](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/16431) for instructions and lots of screenshots.
    - The Design System team is discussing changing the review & submit page. One proposal was to add links that returned the Veteran to the page within the flow instead of allowing inline changes on the review & submit page. This would also require active validation on the entire form that would only allow returning to the review & submit page once there are no longer any validation errors.

  - Consider splitting off subforms into separate forms, or at least make the subforms into separate chapters


## Claim Status Tool App (CST)

Not much has been done to this app, other than updating to use web components and accessibility fixes; but, a bunch of research was done and a redesign was in process.

Some backend preliminary investigation has been done to see if decision letters can be made available in the app. I don't think this would require any, or maybe minimal, work for the frontend.

## Higher-Level Review (HLR, Form 20-0996)

Higher-Level Review (HLR) version 2 is set to 100% available in production as of February 24, 2022.
Phase 1 involved allowing selection of compensation-only claims, same office selection & choosing an informal conference. Phase 2 (v2) included write-in issues with legacy (SOC/SSOC) statement, a new homeless question, removal of same office and different informal conference time selections. There are a lot of similarities between HLR and the Notice of Disagreement (NOD) form.

The next phase will involve removing the `hlr_v2` feature flag, all the v1 code, removing the wizard, and moving the benefit type question inside the form ([#37470](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/37470), Lighthouse API is ready for this change).

## Board Appeal (NOD, Form 10182)

The Notice of Disagreement form has not yet been released into production. It was ready, and presented to the Board in June 2021. It has since been updated to use the v2 schema, and been through many iterations awaiting the Board's final approval to be published in production.

Lighthouse reported that version 2 of the schema is ready to be implemented, changes outlined in "larter work" entry under "outstanding tickets". But note, that a `representativesName` (v1) and `representative.name` (v2) are included in Lighthouse's schema, but the [Board asked us not to include this entry in the form](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CSKKUL36K/p1623876169114300).

## Letters App

This app has needed some maintenance since this team was started, mostly around the verify address step. There is some mobile app work being done to duplicate this app. Some accessibility updates have been completed recently, but it still needs work.

## Pre-need (Form 40-10007)

- Miscellaneous fixes have been done:
  - Update expiration date
  - Accessibility fixes
  - Content updates
  - Switch React to use web components
  - Another team updated the `race` options
- I don't know if anyone is actively monitoring this form.

This form still needs a lot of work; see later work in outstanding tickets section.

## Burial (Form 21-530EZ)

Research & discovery work in progress. [Lighthouse endpoints](https://dev-developer.va.gov/explore/appeals/docs/decision_reviews?version=current) in place, but no schema.


## Overall work (all apps)

### Improvements

- We're trying to change all the unit tests to use [React testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/), and the code base is still littered with unit test that use [skin-deep](https://github.com/glenjamin/skin-deep) and [enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/). The current recommendation is to write all new tests using testing library, but eventually we'll need to convert all the old tests over
- Review and restore skipped (flaky) unit & e2e tests.
- There may be many feature flags that are no longer being used, or have been enabled for a long time, we need to remove the feature flag code, and the flag itself.
- There is a plan to remove all wizards, so we need to incorporate wizard into the form so that there is only one question per page (Form 526 & HLR needs this).
