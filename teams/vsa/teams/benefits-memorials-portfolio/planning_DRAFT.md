# Benefits Crew Priorities 2022
With VA.gov, we've built something that truly embodies VA's ongoing mission to fulfill President Lincoln’s promise to care for those ‘who shall have borne the battle’ and for their families, caregivers, and survivors. VA.gov has evolved to be not only the "front door" of the Veteran experience, but a robust set of shared tools, software, support, and technical infrastructure with integrations to many of the VA's most important Veteran data repositories. We have increased the accessibility, reliability, and security of Veteran’s digital services, while also delivering faster, more accurate benefits decisions. VA.gov offers Veterans the quickest pathway to find, use, and receive VA benefits and services.

Unfortunately, while we do a good job of exposing new benefits to Veterans, we are failing to leverage our unique context and positioning as the focal point of many Veterans' interactions with the VA. The VA.gov platform is deeply integrated with VA systems across all three agencies and the Board of Veteran's Appeals. However, there is very little cross-cutting innovation or functionality available on the Platform. Veteran's benefits applications aren't updated with their health records; military service history isn't pre-populated in every form.

Let's be honest; a large part of our job is buidling new forms for Veterans. That is valuable work, and we will always do it. But it behooves us to remember our Digital Service DNA: we're here to solve big problems. [PROBLEMS]

Therefore, investing in Lighthouse as a platform and dedicating energy toward developing a comprehensive API strategy should be something we all work on. Lighthouse can be our legacy; the sum of the exercise of all our crafts. A launchpad for individuals and organizations to securely access the VA data they need to build helpful tools and services for Veterans at no cost.

The VA's strategic position is pretty unique. Not only are we the market leader when it comes to Veteran data, we're kind of the only game in town. An uncle once told me, "With great power comes great responsibility"

## New benefits workflows 

### [Add payment information to My VA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/payment-history/discovery-and-research/README.md)

People have mentioned that seeing payment info on their My VA dashboard is a high priority since our [initial dashboard discovery in 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#for-those-interested-in-education-benefits-gi-bill-balance-and-payment-information-was-most-important), and again in later research sessions, including during [December 2020 exploration research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/product/Research/MyVA-research-findings.md#additional-insights), [March 2021 usability testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/product/Research%20V2/MyVA2-research-findings.md#features-users-expected-to-see-that-were-missing), and [July 2021 notifications discovery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#for-those-interested-in-education-benefits-gi-bill-balance-and-payment-information-was-most-important). The importance of payment information also bears out in analytics. Viewing payments is [a top interaction on VA.gov overall](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-event-events/a50123418w177519031p184624291/_u.date00=20201122&_u.date01=20211121&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.rowCount=50&_r.drilldown=analytics.eventCategory:Interactions/), and "Payments" is  [a top search from the My VA dashboard](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/product/post-2.0-redesign-analytics.md#searches). This effort aims to add payment information to the My VA dashboard and to determine if any other financial information should be elevated as part of the MVP.

**Targeted launch**: End of Q1/beginning of Q2 2022

### Additional work

We are aware there may need to be updates to My VA as a result of the following projects, but we do not have definite timelines or scope at this time:

- Updates to My VA based on health care apartment needs
- Updates to My VA based on the homepage redesign 

## On-site notifications

### [MVP build](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/notifications/vagov-notifications/mvp/README.md)

In addition to emails and text messages, on-site notifications are part of a cross-platform strategy to get important action items & alerts in front of VA.gov users. This effort aims to create the first on-site notification powered by the VANotify platform.

**Targeted launch**: End of Q1/beginning of Q2 2022

## Profile

### [Update personal information section of the profile: Add LGBTQ data points](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/personal-information/personal-information-revision/README.md)

We are integrating preferred name, pronouns, gender identity, and sexual orientation into the VA.gov profile as part of a request from VEO and the LGBTQ Health Services office. This effort will allow veterans to more accurately define themselves within the VA, and it will help mitigate issues around veterans showing up to health appointments and being addressed improperly.

**Targeted launch**: End of Q1 2022

### Additional work

We are currently talking to VA Profile, VANotify, and VEText to figure out what is next for the notification preferences feature that just launched, but we are not sure what those are at this point. We'll work with these teams as necessary to figure out process for incorporating new preferences.
