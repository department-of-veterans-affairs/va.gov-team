## Guideposts
### Mission:
Provides Veterans, family members, caregivers, service members and other audiences access to vital information about VA benefits and services.

### Vision:
We envision a world where it takes less time to find information about VA benefits and services than it does on Google. 

### North Stars:
1. Increase the use of self-service tools and associated number of conversions
2. Decrease time users spend waiting for an outcome
3. Consistent Customer satisfaction, reliability and secure online UX

## What we work on
### Product Suite
Unauthenticated Experience for VA.gov

### Product Portfolio:
-	Home Page 
-	Header / Footer 
-	Redirect Benefit Hubs 2.0 
-	On-site Search 2.0
-	Contact Us/ Help Utility
- Metrics - baseline and goals
- Learning Center Content / IA 


### Responsibilities (Problem space and user goals):
1. We will develop and deliver the content, navigation, and tools that provide our customers the easiest way to find and act upon any VA service.

2. We will strategize, write, develop, and collaborate with others in unauthenticated content and products for Veterans on VA.gov.

#### Issue Etiquette
**For Requests originating outside the Public Websites team** - please use our [Intake Form](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=lunascoop&labels=vsa-public-websites%2C+vsa%2C+vsa-public-websites-intake%2C+needs-grooming%2C+Epic&template=public-websites-intake.md&title=%3CType+of+Request%3E+from+%3CTeam%3E)

For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the [Standard Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=standard-issue.md&title=):

- Title that explains task
- [Estimate](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WftRc1JeNxVAh7u1iiW5c5Et0HbM_uBqxhCXL6NGYog/edit)
- Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
- Labels: _your team's labels_ 
- User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
- Nested in an Epic

All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

#### Team Norms

- Be on time and present for programmed meetings
- Be respectful, both online and off
- Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
- Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
- We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
- Strive for oppurtunties to collaborate 
- Assume best intentions - especially when in a remote setting
- Trust one another and ask questions freely and frequently
- Celebrate the wins
- Let’s have fun and do great work!

#### Decision Etiquette
Decisions are part of our daily routine, the below questions can help kickstart the decision making and creative thinking process.
1. Is it my decision to make?
2. Do I have all the information to make the decision?
3. Do I have to make the decision now?

#### Communication Best Practices 
- Slack - best communication method
- Slack channels allow us to do our work in the open so that others can learn from the questions asked and the answers provided. Please do the same.
- VFS teams should use public Slack channels as their first method of communication.
- Don't wait to organize a meeting to ask a question; this will slow our team down.
- Email - least effective communication method (Email communications are not easily searchable or archivable. Use this as a last resort for communication.)

#### Slack:
#vsa-public-websites

#### GitHub
label: vsa-public-websites

#### General things
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
