_Example: How many URLs does VA currently have? Where are they currently managed (TeamSite, WordPress)? What's the usage data on these? How many of these are legally required pages? How many of these are tier 1/2 Veteran-facing, how many tier 3 administration/program office content?_

__blah.va.gov subdomain pages:__
- VA currently has 530 subdomain sites. 

- URLs: __468,856*__ (for the 379 subdomains we were able to map)

* _We were able to crawl only 379 subdomains. The remaining sudomains didn't have pages that could be mapped (bc of the way the pages are built) but probably do have have content. So this is an under count of what's really out there._
