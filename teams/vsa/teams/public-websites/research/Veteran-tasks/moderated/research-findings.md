# Research Goals
We would like to learn which VA-related tasks are most important to Veterans and caregivers so that these tasks can be best supported from the VA.gov home page. The goal of this research was to **get feedback from Veterans and others** (including Veterans' family members or caregivers, survivors, and service members) **on a survey designed to identify Veteran top tasks**. We wanted to get feedback on the tasks, questions, and instructions before launching the unmoderated survey to a large group of Veterans and others to complete independently (without a researcher present).

*Note: Because this research is like an extended pilot of the survey, this abbreviated report describes the findings and recommendations needed to make revisions to the survey and then move forward with the unmoderated research. Some details have been omitted in order to move as quickly as possible to the unmoderated research.*

Veteran tasks fit into the Veteran journey throughout their lives:
- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life
- Retiring and aging

# Research Questions
## Primary
1. Are there any tasks in the survey that are unclear or confusing?
1. Are there any important tasks missing from the survey?
1. Is there anything about the survey that is unclear or confusing?

## For unmoderated research phase, but could look at preliminary results
3. When Veterans and others contact the VA, what tasks are most important to them?
4. How many tasks do Veterans and others identify as important to themselves?
5. What tasks are least important?

# Methodology 

We conducted remote moderated research sessions via Zoom. Research participants were asked about VA-related tasks that they do, and then were given an online survey link to do while sharing their web browser screen and talking aloud.

The online survey was built in Optimal Workshop's survey tool, which is called Questions. The survey contained a list of 41 VA-related tasks that were  synthesized from colleagues, the VA.gov home page, user research studies, and top VA site searches. The [list of tasks](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/moderated/Task%20List%20for%20Veteran%20Top%20Task%20Research.xlsx) was reviewed by colleagues in IA and Content. In order to keep the list down to a manageable length, some related tasks were combined (e.g., *Learn about or apply for VA health care*), and a few tasks that are required to be supported were omitted (e.g., *Contact the Veterans Crisis Line*, and *Report harassment that occurred at a VA site or online*).

In the survey, participants were asked to select which VA-related tasks were important to them personally right now (*not* for all Veterans). Participants were also asked if there were any VA-related tasks that were important to them that weren't on the list, and which tasks they do most frequently.


# Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Veterans and others will find the survey intuitive to use from desktop or mobile.

    2. TRUE: All participants were able to fill out the survey from the desktop or mobile device they were using. 

3. Veterans and others will be able to select which of the VA-related tasks presented in the survey are most important to them.

    2. MOSTLY TRUE: All participants were able to select important tasks but some of the tasks were unclear to a few of the participants.
   
5. Veterans and others won't find any important tasks missing from the survey.

    2. FALSE: 3 participants suggested additional tasks that they currently do that weren't on the list in the survey.

# Key Findings

1. The **survey was well-received** by research participants. 
2. Three participants were **unclear on the meaning of a few of the tasks**.
7. Two participants **didn't scroll on the task importance question** and so didn't see the full task list. 
8. Two people said that the **long list of tasks was overwhelming** and recommended breaking them down into categories. The other 5 participants thought the list was OK as is.
10. (Preliminary results) Top tasks: The tasks **selected by the most people as important were *Learn about or file for disability compensation* and *Schedule or manage health appointments*.**
11. (Preliminary results) **Participants selected an average of 13 tasks as important (ranging from 3 to 26)**.


# Details of Findings 

**1. The survey was well-received by research participants**

- All but one participant thought that the survey was **simple and easy to fill out**.
- Four participants thought the **list of tasks seemed complete**. The other 3 participants suggested a few additions.
- Four participants **understood the meaning of all of the tasks** listed in the survey.
- Two participants were **able to fill out the survey based on their recent *indirect* experience with the VA** from helping others with VA benefits (*vs.* interacting directly with the VA on their own behalf or someone else's). 
- Two participants remarked that they liked how **related tasks** (e.g., all about disability) **were near each other** in the list (a change made after the first pilot participant, who found the then-random order of tasks to be disorienting).

**2. Three participants were unclear on the meaning of a few of the tasks**
This is described below in the Recommendations section.

**3. Two participants **didn't scroll on the task importance question** 
This is described below in the Recommendations section.

**4. Two people said that the **long list of tasks was overwhelming**
2 of 7 participants suggested breaking down the long list of tasks into categories by topic (e.g., health care, disability, education). We know that having a survey question with 41 multi-select options isn't ideal, but this is the standard methodology for top tasks research because you want participants to *compare ALL tasks at once* (*vs.* only tasks in one category at a time).

To make it easier for participants to read through the entire list while considering importance, tasks in similar categories were ordered next to each other (*vs.* presenting tasks in a random order).

**5. (Preliminary results) Top tasks: *Learn about or file for disability compensation* and *Schedule or manage health appointments*.**
This top task data from only 7 participants isn't enough to be at all confident of the results, but the data is summarized below in the bar chart and table. To get more reliable data, we will invite a larger number of people to the unmoderated survey. 

The following three tasks weren't marked as important by any of the 7 participants and so are least important to this small sample:
- Get help with your housing, rent, or utilities
- Get help with your VA debt
- Pay your VA copay bill or other VA debt

**6. (Preliminary results) Participants selected an average of 13 tasks as important**

From the list of 41 VA-related tasks presented in the survey, research **participants selected an average of 13 tasks as important (ranging from 3 to 26)**. 
- The two people who selected only 3 tasks were a service member (for whom most VA-related tasks were irrelevant) and a Veteran (who was only using the VA education benefit and interpreted "right now" in the question quite literally, even though she was interested in using other benefits in the future). 
- The two people who selected the greatest numbers of tasks (21 and 26) were a Veteran's caregiver and a Veteran--both of whom were interested in exploring many VA benefits that were new to them.

The task importance question included in the survey during this research was worded as follows: 
*Please check the VA-related tasks below that are most important to YOU personally right now, no matter how you do them (in person, on the phone, or online).* 

Originally, the survey asked people to "select about 10 tasks" and didn't specify timeframe (past, present, future) or modality of interaction with the VA (in person, phone, online). Based on experiences during piloting, we removed "about 10 tasks" from the question (to reduce cognitive load and give participants the freedom to select however many were important to them) and added the timeframe and modality (to improve clarity).


# Recommendations
Because this moderated research was a kind of extended pilot test for the unmoderated research, the revisions that will be made to the survey are summarized below, along with the rationale for each.

## Changes to the list of tasks

Recommendation | Rationale
-------------- | ---------
Consider **adding a few more tasks**: See if my illness or condition might be service-connected (e.g., Agent Orange exposure), Find a rehab/nursing home, Get durable medical equipment, Volunteer at events to support the VA. *UPDATE: This recommendation was discussed by the team but then rejected.* | 3 participants suggested these additional tasks because they do them but didn't see them in the list
**Add brief descriptions to some tasks** to explain these terms or tasks: disability; Update your VA health care information; travel reimbursement; Get help with your housing, rent or utilities; VA benefit letters; VA caregiver assistance program; Veteran events; VSO; pension; pre-needed determination | 3 participants were unclear on the meaning of some of these terms in the tasks

## Changes to the survey questions

Recommendation | Rationale
-------------- | ---------
Change **wording of benefits experience question (#5)**: "including" to "for example", and put "or" between the examples | 1 participant not sure whether to mark that they have experience with Career Services if they have experience with one but not the other example listed
**Clarify housing options in benefits experience question (#5)**: move "home loans" into a new option and rename to "home loan Certificate of Eligibility (COE)" | 1 participant had gotten a COE but not a home loan, and then didn't check the "housing" option
Add **new option to VA interaction question (#1)**: "I don't contact the VA directly, but I hear about it while helping someone else" | 2 participants knew about the VA through helping other Veteran(s) access their benefits--1 talks with her dad about VA services even though he lives far away from her; 1 helps other Veterans by answering questions through the Together We Served organization
Add **new question at the end about the respondent's role** (Veteran, Veteran's family member, Veteran's caregiver, Service member, Survivor, Other) | Same reason as above, and sometimes Perigean's information about participants is out-of-date
**Add to task importance question (#2): "you'll need to scroll** down to see all the options" | 2 participants didn't realize that they had to scroll to see the full task list
**Add to task importance question (#2) options: "None of the above"** | 1 participant (a service member) noticed that the question was required but there's no way to answer if none of the tasks are important, as might be the case for other service members

## Changes to the survey welcome and closing messages

Recommendation | Rationale
-------------- | ---------
Add to the survey welcome about **what we're doing** (i.e., mention VA, want to learn more about what VA benefits and services are most important to you so we can help) | 1 participant wanted to know the intent behind the survey to legitimize it
Add to survey welcome: **"This is a short survey with a few short questions and one longer question"** | Participants were pleasantly surprised that the survey was so short after filling out the long task importance question
Add to the survey ending message about **how to get info about any of the VA benefits** mentioned in this survey (go to VA.gov) | Several participants said that they wanted to know more about some of the VA benefits

## Who we talked to 

**Recruitment criteria**

We wanted to interview some Veterans and others who had a diverse range of experience with VA benefits and services, including no experience at all and some experience that doesn't include VA health care.

We talked to **7 participants.**

Audience segments:
* Veterans: 4 
* Caregivers: 1 
* Family members of a Veteran: 1 
* Service member: 1 


Experience with VA benefits and services:
* Experience with one or more VA benefits or services (i.e., health care, education or career services, disability benefits, housing benefits, pension, life insurance, burial benefits): 7 (ALL of them)
* NO experience with health care, but DO have experience with one or more other VA benefits or services: 2
* NO experience with ANY VA benefits or services: 0 
 
**We wanted to get some participants without any VA benefits experience at all, but the participants recruited who didn't have any experience according to Perigean's recruitment survey actually did have experience**--perhaps because the survey data was outdated (at least it was for the participant who had just applied for a home loan certificate of eligibility the day before the research session).
