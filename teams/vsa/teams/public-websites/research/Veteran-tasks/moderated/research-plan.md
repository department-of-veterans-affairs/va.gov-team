# Research Plan for Veteran Top Tasks MODERATED (Phase 1 of 2), Public Websites, Feb 15, 2022

## Background
The current design of the VA.gov home page provides easy access to some Veteran tasks in four boxes near the top of the page. [User research on the home page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-readout-full-June8.pdf) has shown that other tasks are more challenging to do when starting from the home page. We would like to learn which VA-related tasks are most important to Veterans and caregivers.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme): 
- Increase the usage and throughput of VA services

### Veteran Journey
Veteran tasks fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) throughout 
- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life 
- Retiring and aging 

## Research Goals	
The goal of this research is to get feedback from Veterans and caregivers on a card sort designed to identify Veteran top tasks. We want to get feedback on the cards, categories, and instructions before launching the unmoderated card sort to a large group of Veterans and caregivers (on their own without a researcher present). 

### Outcome
The feedback we get on the card sort will be used to refine it to better prepare for people to complete it unmoderated.

### Research questions
1. When Veterans or their caregivers contact the VA, what tasks are most important to them? 
2. What tasks are least important? 
3. Are there any tasks in the card sort that are unclear or confusing?
4. Are there any important tasks missing?
5. Is there anything about the card sort that is unclear or confusing?

### Hypotheses
1. Veterans and caregivers will find the card sort intuitive to use.
2. Veterans and caregivers will be able to assess the importance of each of the VA-related tasks presented in the card sort.
3. Veterans and caregivers won't find any important tasks missing from the card sort.

## Method: Moderated Sessions over Zoom	
We will conduct remote moderated research sessions via Zoom. Research participants will be asked about VA-related tasks that they do, and then they will be given a card sort activity link to do independently while sharing their web browser screen and talking aloud.

The card sort will be built in Optimal Workshop and will contain a list of about 30 (or maybe more) tasks that have been synthesized from colleagues, the VA.gov home page, user research studies, and top VA site searches. In the card sort, participants will rate the importance of each task for themselves only (not for all Veterans) by sorting it into one of several fixed categories (i.e., *important to me and I do it frequently, important to me but I don't do it frequently, not important to me, I don't understand this task*). They will also be able to add new tasks and sort them.

*Action item: Synthesize and remove duplicates from tasks collected to get down to a list of ~30 tasks (or maybe more).* 
- *Schedule discussion with Mikki Northuis (sitewide IA)*
- *Schedule discussion with Meg Peters and Tracey Mulrooney (health apartment)*

*Action item: Get Optimal Workshop license--reach out to Ariel*
*Action item: Create a card sort with different tokens for recruiting cohorts.*
