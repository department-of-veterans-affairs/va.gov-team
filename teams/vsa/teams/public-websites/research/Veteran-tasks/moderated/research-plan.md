# Research Plan for Veteran Top Tasks MODERATED (Phase 1 of 2) Interviews, Sitewide Home Page team, May 13, 2022

## Background
The current design of the VA.gov home page provides easy access to some Veteran tasks in four boxes near the top of the page. [User research on the home page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-readout-full-June8.pdf) has shown that other tasks are more challenging to do when starting from the home page. We would like to learn which VA-related tasks are most important to Veterans and caregivers so that these tasks can be best supported from the home page.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme): 
- Increase the usage and throughput of VA services

### Veteran Journey
Veteran tasks fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) throughout 
- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life 
- Retiring and aging 

## Research Goals	
The goal of this research is to get feedback from Veterans and others (including Veterans' family members or caregivers, survivors, and service members) on a survey designed to identify Veteran top tasks. We want to get feedback on the tasks, questions, and instructions before launching the unmoderated survey to a large group of Veterans and others to complete independently (without a researcher present). 

### Outcome
The feedback we get on the survey will be used to refine it to better prepare for Veterans and others to complete it independently.

### Research questions
1. When Veterans and others contact the VA, what tasks are most important to them? 
2. How many tasks do Veterans and others identify as important to themselves?
3. What tasks are least important? 
4. Are there any tasks in the survey that are unclear or confusing?
5. Are there any important tasks missing from the survey?
6. Is there anything about the survey that is unclear or confusing?

### Hypotheses
1. Veterans and others will find the survey intuitive to use from desktop or mobile.
2. Veterans and others will be able to select which of the VA-related tasks presented in the survey are most important to them.
3. Veterans and others won't find any important tasks missing from the survey.

## Method: Moderated Sessions over Zoom	
We will conduct remote moderated research sessions via Zoom. Research participants will be asked about VA-related tasks that they do, and then they will be given an online survey link to do while sharing their web browser screen and talking aloud.

The online survey will be built in Optimal Workshop's survey tool, which is called Questions. The survey will contain a list of about 40 VA-related tasks that have been synthesized from colleagues, the VA.gov home page, user research studies, and top VA site searches. The [list of tasks](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/moderated/Task%20List%20for%20Veteran%20Top%20Task%20Research.xlsx) has been reviewed by colleagues in IA and Content. In order to keep the list down to a manageable length, some related tasks have been combined (e.g., *Learn about or apply for VA health care*), and a few tasks that are required to be supported have been omitted (e.g., *Contact the Veterans Crisis Line*, and *Report harassment that occurred at a VA site or online*).

In the survey, participants will select which VA-related tasks are important to them personally (*not* for all Veterans). Participants will also be asked if there are any VA-related tasks that are important to them that weren't on the list, and which tasks they do most frequently.
