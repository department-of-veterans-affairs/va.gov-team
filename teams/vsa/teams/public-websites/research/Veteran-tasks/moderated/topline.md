This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends observed in the research sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. *The information in this document may change, following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.*

**The goal of this document is as follows:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from the team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high-level themes

## Introduction
The purpose of this research was to get feedback from Veterans and others (including Veterans' family members or caregivers, survivors, and service members) on a survey designed to identify Veteran top tasks. We wanted to get feedback on the tasks, questions, and instructions before launching the unmoderated survey to a large group of Veterans and others to complete independently (without a researcher present).

## Participants
We talked to **7 people (4 Veterans, 1 Caregiver of a Veteran, 1 Dependent of a Veteran, and 1 Service Member)**. 
- ALL of them had experience with some VA benefits or services, though 2 of them had the experience only *indirectly* by advising a Veteran on how to work with the VA. 
- 2 had no experience with VA health care.
- 1 had experience with only one VA benefit (education).
- We wanted to have some participants who didn't have *any* experience with VA benefits, but that wasn't the case for those recruited by Perigean (except for one with only indirect VA experience through her dad), presumably due to outdated information in their recruitment database.

## Preliminary Findings
### Survey Successes
1. All but one participant thought that the survey was **simple and easy to fill out**.
2. Four participants thought the **list of tasks seemed complete**. The other 3 participants suggested a few additions.
3. Four participants **understood the meaning of all of the tasks** listed in the survey.
4. Two participants were **able to fill out the survey based on their recent *indirect* experience with the VA** from helping others with VA benefits (*vs.* interacting directly with the VA on their own behalf or someone else's). 
5. Two participants remarked that they liked how **related tasks** (e.g., all about disability) **were near each other** in the list (a change made after the first pilot participant, who found the then-random order of tasks to be disorienting).

### Issues with the Survey
6. Three participants were **unclear on the meaning of a few of the tasks**.
7. Two participants **didn't scroll on the task importance question** and so didn't see the full task list. 
8. Two people said that the **long list of tasks was overwhelming** and recommended breaking them down into categories. The other 5 participants thought the list was OK as is.

### Number of tasks marked as "important"
9. From the list of 41 VA-related tasks presented in the survey, research **participants selected an average of 13 tasks as important (ranging from 3 to 26)**. 
- The two people who selected only 3 tasks were a service member (for whom most VA-related tasks were irrelevant) and a Veteran (who was only using the VA education benefit and interpreted "right now" in the question quite literally, even though she was interested in using other benefits in the future). 
- The two people who selected the greatest numbers of tasks (21 and 26) were a Veteran's caregiver and a Veteran--both of whom were interested in exploring many VA benefits that were new to them.

The task importance question included in the survey during this research was worded as follows: 
*Please check the VA-related tasks below that are most important to YOU personally right now, no matter how you do them (in person, on the phone, or online).* 

Originally, the survey asked people to "select about 10 tasks" and didn't specify timeframe (past, present, future) or modality of interaction with the VA (in person, phone, online). Based on experiences during piloting, we removed "about 10 tasks" from the question (to reduce cognitive load and give participants the freedom to select however many were important to them) and added the timeframe and modality (to improve clarity).



## Next Steps
From data synthesis, I will put together a list of revisions for the survey before launching it to more people.
