# Research Goals
The current design of the VA.gov home page provides easy access to some Veteran tasks in four boxes near the top of the page. [User research on the home page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-readout-full-June8.pdf) has shown that other tasks are more challenging to do when starting from the home page. 

We wanted to learn which VA-related tasks are most important to Veterans and others, including Veterans' family members or caregivers, survivors, and service members, so that these tasks can be best supported from the home page. 

The top tasks that we identify could be used to inform the redesign of the VA.gov home page and measure the overall health of VA.gov. We can use the top tasks we identify to run baseline usability tests and then regular tests at intervals. Over time, these tests will tell us whether Veterans can quickly and easily complete all top tasks. We can also look at the navigation path(s) for each top task and examine analytics for them. The identification of top tasks will also be informative to other teams working throughout the VA.gov ecosystem.

Veteran tasks fit into the Veteran journey throughout their lives:

- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life
- Retiring and aging

# Research Questions
1. When Veterans and others contact the VA, what tasks are most important to them?
4. How many tasks do Veterans and others identify as important to themselves?
5. What tasks are least important?
5. Are there any important tasks missing?
6. What tasks are done most frequently?

# Methodology 
**In the first phase of this research, we conducted a moderated study** in which 7 participants completed an online survey while talking aloud. 

The online survey was built in Optimal Workshop's survey tool, which is called Questions. The **survey contained a list of 41 VA-related tasks** that were synthesized from colleagues, the VA.gov home page, user research studies, and top VA site searches. The list of tasks was reviewed by colleagues in IA and Content. In order to keep the list down to a manageable length, some related tasks were combined (e.g., *Learn about or apply for VA health care*), and a few tasks that are required to be supported were omitted (e.g., *Contact the Veterans Crisis Line*, and *Report harassment that occurred at a VA site or online*). In the survey, participants selected which VA-related tasks were important to them personally (*not* for all Veterans). Note that participants were asked about task importance without the context of any VA-provided web pages, and the tasks don't align with the tasks currently displayed on the VA.gov homepage. Thus, the findings are not directly comparable with VA.gov home page click analytics data. The survey also asked if there were any VA-related tasks that are important to them that weren't on the list, and which tasks they do most frequently. 

Based on participants' feedback and usability issues with the survey as documented in the [research findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/moderated/research-findings.md), the survey questions were refined to make them more clear and able to be completed independently in the second phase of research. 

**The second phase of research was an unmoderated study** in which participants were invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants received a link to the online survey. We wanted to get complete survey responses from **at least 30 Veterans and others (ideally 40-50)**, in distinct cohorts of fewer than 10 participants per cohort (per PRA). 

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Veterans and others will generally agree on which tasks are the most important.

    2. PARTLY TRUE: There is general agreement in task importance within subgroups of participants but not overall. There are major differences in task importance between people who are using VA health care *vs.* not using it, and also between older and younger people. 

3. Veterans and others will generally agree on which tasks are the least important.

    2. PARTLY TRUE: Same reasoning as above.
   

# Key Findings

*Note: The Key Findings below are presented in a logical order, not in order of importance.*

1. Across all survey participants, **most top tasks were related to health care**:
- Schedule or manage health appointments
- Message your doctor or get a health care message
- Check your lab or test results
- Refill or track a prescription
- Learn about or file for disability compensation (service-related)
- Get your VA medical records

2. The **most *frequently done* tasks were all related to health care** and aligned closely with the overall top tasks. (The survey asked this in an open-text field, not by providing a list of tasks from which to choose.)

3. **For participants who don't use VA health care, top tasks were quite different**, with the only overlap being *disability compensation* and *VA medical records*.

4. **Top tasks varied by participant age**, with older participants favoring health care and burial tasks, while younger participants more focused on education benefits and payment history.

5. **Merging the top tasks from all of the above segments (all participants, different age groups, and VA health care users and non-users) results in a longer list of top tasks** that can be categorized in various ways. 

6. Here are the **least important tasks overall**:
- Verify your monthly school enrollment
- Learn about or order hearing aid batteries
- Get help with your rent, utility bills, or other housing-related expenses
- Apply to receive benefits as a Veteran's caregiver
- Get help with your VA debt

7. Participants selected an **average of 9.5 tasks as important**, ranging from 1 to 26. This was interesting because we didn't include the "select up to 10" wording that was originally in the survey question.

8. It was **challenging to recruit people who don't use VA benefits** because such people generally aren't interested in providing feedback to VA. We wanted 20% of such participants but instead got only 2% (1 participant of 55).


# Details of Findings 

Notes:
- Survey responses from **55 participants** were analyzed: **48** from the unmoderated survey (phase 2) plus **7** from the moderated interviews (phase 1).
- We didn't have enough survey participants for the results to be statistically significant. This means that if the study were run again, the results may not exactly match the data in this report. Based on the number of responses we had, individual percentages for specific tasks could differ as much as +/- 10%. However, it's still worthwhile to do this research because large differences between tasks--the top tasks *vs.* the bottom tasks--are likely to be accurate.

## 1. Most top tasks were related to health care

Survey participants were asked to mark which VA-related tasks *are most important to YOU personally right now, no matter how you do them (in person, on the phone, or online).*

Five of the top 6 tasks marked as important to the greatest number of participants were related to health care, as shown in the table below. Percentages greater than 50 are highlighted in red, and 40-59% are highlighted in orange. 

![top-tasks-all-ps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/top-tasks-all-ps.png)

The percentages for these top tasks can be compared to all the other tasks in the bar chart and the table below. 

![bar-chart--all-ps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/top-tasks-all-ps-chart.png)

![all-tasks-all-ps-table](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/all-tasks-all-ps-table.png)

## 2. Most frequently done tasks were all related to health care 

Survey participants were asked *What VA-related tasks do you do MOST FREQUENTLY?* to answer with open-ended text. By far the most numerous responses were for health care tasks:

1. Schedule/check medical appointments (19)
1. Refill a prescription (15)
1. Message/contact medical providers (9)
1. MyHealtheVet *[no specific task]* (6)
1. Check/verify/transfer education benefits (4)

From the above list of 5 frequently done tasks, #1-3 above were top tasks #1, 2, and 4 across all participants. #4 MyHealtheVet above wasn't included as a task in our survey but likely involves doing some or all of tasks #1-3. Education-related tasks were further down in the top tasks.

## 3. For participants who don't use VA health care, top tasks were quite different

Because most of the top tasks across all survey responses were related to health care, we segmented the data by participants who use VA health care (41 or 75%) and those who don't use VA health care (14 or 25%). When you compare the top tasks for each of these groups, the results are very different, and only *disability compensation* and *VA medical records* are on both lists (see below). 

For people who don't use VA health care, it might be unexpected that *Get your VA medical records* would be an important task. However, they may have medical records from past experience with VA health care (maybe they voluntarily disenrolled or became ineligible), or perhaps they mean DoD medical records from their military service.

![top-tasks-no-hc-ps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/top-tasks-no-hc-ps.png)

![top-tasks-hc-ps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/top-tasks-hc-ps.png)

It is interesting to note that in the above top tasks lists, the *disability compensation percentage is much higher for people without VA health care* (71%) as compared to those with VA health care (37%). Perhaps a number of Veterans start exploring disability compensation before applying for VA health care.

## 4. Top tasks varied by participant age

We segmented participants by age to see whether there were differences in top tasks selected. We compared the top tasks from participants who were at least 55 years old (42% of all participants) with the top tasks from participants under 35 years old (13% of participants). 

The results showed that **older participants thought health care and burial tasks were most important**, whereas **younger participants were more focused on education benefits, payment history, and contact information**--and *not* health care (see tables below). 

Note that the older group had many more people (23 of 55) than the younger group (7 of 55). We also defined a third segment with the 25 participants  who were between the oldest and youngest groups (age 35-54). The data from these 25 **in-between-aged participants** (45% of all participants) align more with the older group--**mostly health care tasks plus disability compensation, but no burial**.

## 5. Merging the top tasks from all of the above segments (all participants, different age groups, and VA health care users and non-users) results in a longer list of top tasks

The goal of this research was to come up with one list of top tasks that can be used in the VA.gov home page design, usability studies, and other user research and analytics assessments of VA.gov. As detailed above, survey responses from the following 6 different segments of participants were analyzed for this report: 
1. All participants
2. Participants using VA health care
3. Participants *not* using VA health care
4. Participants who were 55 years old or older
5. Participants who were 35-54 years old
6. Participants who were under 35 years old

All tasks that were marked as important by at least 30% of any one of the above segments were compiled, and the number of times that each task appeared on one of the 6 lists was tallied, along with the percentage of all participants who marked each as important. 

![top-tasks-6segments-tallies&percents](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/top-tasks-6segments-tallies%26percents.png)

The above results show which tasks were rated as important the most often, and this leads to the partition below into **primary, secondary, and tertiary top tasks**. Within each primary/secondary/tertiary grouping, tasks are in order of decreasing percentage selected by all participants.

![top-tasks-6segments-tallies-a](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/top-tasks-6segments-tallies-a.png)

These top 25 tasks can be **viewed by benefit category**, as seen below in the order above and then sorted by benefit. 9 of the top 25 tasks are related to health care, followed by 4 related to education, 3 related to disability, 3 other, and 6 that are independent of the benefit categories.

![top-tasks-by-benefit](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/top-tasks-by-benefit.png)

![top-tasks-by-benefit-sorted](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/top-tasks-by-benefit-sorted.png)


## 6. Least important tasks overall

Below are the *least important* tasks across all survey participants, which were marked as important by fewer than 10% of participants.

![low-tasks-all-ps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/low-tasks-all-ps.png)

The first of these tasks *(Learn about or apply for monthly Veterans pension payments)* turned out to be a duplicate of a top task *(Learn about or file for disability compensation)* and so perhaps wasn't well understood and thus not marked as important. 

Two of these tasks involve financial help (*Get help with your rent, utility bills, or other housing-related expenses* and *Get help with your VA debt*), so perhaps most of our research participants are not currently facing financial hardship. Other low-importance tasks involve less popular VA benefits (e.g., caregiver program), as well as other benefits that apply to fewer people (hearing aids, school enrollment verification--only relevant if you're currently in school). 


## 7. Participants selected an average of 9.5 tasks as important

In the survey question about selecting which tasks are important, we didn't specify how many tasks to select. We had hoped that people would select about 5-10 of them. The average number selected was 9.5, with a range from 1 to 26. The average of 9.5 was interesting because we had originally included the instruction "select up to 10" but removed it. In the chart below, the number of tasks selected shows a normal curve, with the greatest number of people selecting 6-10 tasks. The mode (most commonly occurring number of tasks) was 7.

![#tasks-selected](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/%23tasks-selected.png)

## 8. Challenging to recruit people who don't use VA benefits

In recruiting participants for this survey, we wanted people who had experience with a variety of VA benefits and services so that each of our tasks would be potentially relevant to at least some respondents (see chart and table below). **The greatest number of survey respondents had experience with VA health care, disability, and education.** One person wrote in that they have experience with services for MST (Military Sexual Trauma).

![benefit-experience-chart](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/benefit-experience-chart.png)

![benefit-experience-table](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/benefit-experience-table.png)

We also wanted 20% of our participants to be people who *haven't used any VA benefits but were interested in doing so*, so that the "learn about or apply" tasks might be most relevant for those people. Unfortunately, Perigean had difficulty recruiting people who don't use VA benefits, perhaps due to the following reasons:
1. Some of the benefits usage data in Perigean's recruitment database were outdated because people may have applied for new benefits after filling out the recruitment survey. This was true for one participant interviewed during a moderated session who said he had applied for a home loan Certificate of Eligibility the day before the research session. 
2. **People who don't use VA benefits generally aren't interested in providing feedback to VA.**

We had only one participant (2%) who had no experience with VA benefits, which is a long way from our original goal of 20%. Some participants had experience with only one or two VA benefits.

## Other Findings

### How participants interact with VA
**A majority (about 60%) of survey participants use MyHealtheVet, VA.gov, visit a VA site, and/or call the VA**. Digital interactions (MyHealtheVet and VA.gov) are slightly higher than person-to-person interactions (at a VA site or over the phone). Somewhat fewer participants (38%) use eBenefits, which is going away. A small number of people said that they don't contact the VA directly (7%) or don't interact with VA at all (6%).  

Note that the percentages add up to more than 100% because many people interact with VA in more than way.

![interact-VA-chart](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/interact-VA-chart.png)

![interact-VA-table](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/interact-VA-table.png)

### Missing tasks
After the task importance question, the survey asked if there were any other important VA-related tasks that weren't in the previous list. Here is a list of those tasks--each of which was suggested by only one person:
1. Find background, education and qualifications for VA medical providers on a VA-sponsored site 
1. View patient satisfaction results for VA medical providers
1. Obtain a VA satisfaction survey to rate and provide a review of my experience as a patient 
1. Learn if your condition or disability might be connected to Agent Orange exposure (or burn pit, etc.) during your service
1. Find MST (Military Sexual Trauma) events, retreats, support groups 
1. Find a VA Rehab/nursing home
1. Get durable medical equipment
1. Get counseling in insurance options for Veterans (i.e., Medicare, Medicaid, Hospice)
1. Learn about legislative activities that affect VA benefits and programs
1. Obtain assistance with Board for Correction of Naval Records
1. Find out about volunteer events to support the VA
1. Obtain every Choice/Community Care referral provided to me for non-VA care with authorization numbers (in order to prove that VA bills were authorized by the VA and should be paid)


### Feedback for VA

In the open-ended survey responses, there was some feedback specifically for VA, which is listed below but not analyzed because it's outside the scope of this study:
1. The VA service at James Haley Veterans' Hospital in Tampa is outstanding.
1. I would love for all of the VA benefits to be in the same site. For each issue, it seems that there is a totally different site that you have to know about, log into, register, etc.
1. Obtain a call center line/text message that will provide crisis counseling to Vets who are not suicidal. Allow Veterans 24/7 support without threat of mental health hospitalization.
1. Be offered VA medical care, educational groups, diagnostics at times outside of my 8 to 5 work-hours so that I don’t have to take off work every time. VA does not offer ANY appointments outside of work hours. This is a very large gap in care. 
1. Want to be able to see a specialist doctor without having to wait 1-3 months.
1. Request expired prescriptions online instead of calling them in.
1. Be able to email VA medical providers, and allow providers to send me documents by email instead of mailing them to me. 
1. Fix the MyHealthVet app so that attachments that I send by Secure Message go through to the provider. 
1. How does one submit a complaint to the VA about appointments that are cancelled by the VA? 
1. View the entire contents of my medical records on MyHealtheVet, including all addenda, emails between providers, and VA notes that are not provided on a MHV chart request. 
1. The National VA Advisory board members are all urban and not in alignment with rural veterans. 

# Recommendations
1. When choosing user tasks for use in designing the VA.gov home page or planning any user research or analytics, **consider your intended audience:**
- Where will they be in their **journey using VA benefits**? Will they be focused on learning about VA benefits and applying for them? Managing the benefits they already have? Both? 
- Will there will be people who **use VA health care?** People who don't use VA health care? Both? 
- What **age range(s)** of people? Younger? Older? All ages? 

Then **select a range of tasks from the list of the top 25 to have at least some relevance to most people in your user base.**

![top-tasks-6segments-a](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/top-tasks-6segments-a.png)

2. Since the unauthenticated VA.gov home page serves users of all ages and experience levels with VA (including with and without VA health care), **we'd like the home page to support all 25 top tasks**. Usability testing of the redesigned home page will provide valuable input to see whether all top tasks--including both learn/apply and manage benefits tasks--are easy to do from the home page.

3. Since all of the top health care tasks are so important to anyone using VA health care and irrelevant to those who are not, consider grouping them together into one navigation item (i.e., "**manage your health care**") instead of listing them separately:
- Schedule or manage health appointments
- Message your doctor or get a health care message
- Check your lab or test results
- Refill or track a prescription

# Next Steps

- Present results to Sitewide Public Websites, Health Apartment, Authenticated Experience, and any other interested teams.
- Use a variety of top tasks from this research as tasks for usability testing the home page redesign.
- We are not yet deciding which top tasks and how many should be included in the "Common tasks" area of the home page redesign. We expect usability testing of the home page redesign and other discovery efforts (e.g., analytics) to inform decision-making. From the usability research, we'll learn what parts of the home page people use to accomplish tasks (e.g., Common tasks, Search, Benefit hubs), and what works well and not so well.
- For tasks that prove difficult to do from usability testing, consider design changes to the redesigned home page to make them easier, and then do another round of usability testing.

## Who we heard from 

**Recruitment criteria**

We wanted to include Veterans and others who had a diverse range of experience with VA benefits and services, including some whose experience doesn't include VA health care, and some who had no experience at all with VA benefits.

**55 participants** completed the survey (**48** from the unmoderated survey plus **7** from the moderated interviews).

Audience segments:
* Veterans:  47 (86%)
* Family members of a Veteran:  13 (24%)
* Caregivers: 8 (15%)
* Service member:  3 (6%)
