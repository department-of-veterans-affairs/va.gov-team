Subject: Participate in research with VA

Hello,

The VA.gov team at the Department of Veterans Affairs is conducting research to learn what VA-related tasks are most important to you.

We are looking for Veterans who are interested in participating in an online activity to help us understand your preferences.

**What will I be doing in this activity?**

You will be sent a link to an online activity in which you'll see a list of VA-related tasks, and you'll drag-and-drop each, one at a time, into one category based on its importance to you. You'll also be able to create your own tasks. There are no wrong answers. We would like to know how important you think each of the tasks is.

**How long is the activity?**

The activity is self guided and should take you 15-20 minutes to complete on a computer (please don't use a phone or tablet because the screen will be too small). You can do this at any time that's convenient for you.

**Interested in participating?** 

Please reply to this email to receive the activity link and a participation code. After completing the activity, we'll send you instructions on how to access your thank you gift card.
