# Research Plan for Veteran Top Tasks UNMODERATED (Phase 2 of 2), Public Websites, Feb 15, 2022

## Background
The current design of the VA.gov home page provides easy access to some Veteran tasks in four boxes near the top of the page. [User research on the home page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-readout-full-June8.pdf) has shown that other tasks are more challenging to do when starting from the home page. 
We would like to learn which VA-related tasks are most important to Veterans and caregivers.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme): 
- Increase the usage and throughput of VA services

### Veteran Journey
Veteran tasks fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) throughout 
- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life 
- Retiring and aging 

## Research Goals	
The goal of this research is to identify Veteran top tasks. We hope to find a set of 10-12 tasks that are most important from an initial set of about 30 tasks.

### Outcome
The top tasks that we identify could be used to measure the overall health of VA.gov. We can use the top tasks we identify to run baseline usability tests and then regular tests at intervals. Over time, these tests will tell us whether Veterans can quickly and easily complete all top tasks. We can also look at the navigation path(s) for each top task and examine analytics for them.

### Research questions
1. When Veterans or their caregivers contact the VA, what tasks are most important to them? 
2. What tasks are least important? 
3. Are there any tasks in the card sort that are unclear or confusing?
4. Are there any important tasks missing?

### Hypotheses
1. Veterans and caregivers will generally agree on which tasks are the most important.
2. Veterans and caregivers will generally agree on which tasks are the least important.

## Method: Unmoderated Card Sort	
We want to to conduct an unmoderated study in which participants are invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants will receive a link to a card sort activity that contains a list of about 30 VA-related tasks. Each participant rates each of the tasks in terms of its importance for themselves only (not for all Veterans) by sorting it into one of several fixed categories (i.e., very important, somewhat important, not important, I don't understand this task). They will also be able to add new tasks and sort them.

We would like to get complete sorting responses from **at least 30 Veterans and caregivers**, in distinct cohorts of fewer than 10 participants per cohort (per PRA). 

*Action item: Revise card sort per moderated research (part 1 of 2).*

*Action item: Add a question for participants to provide their unique code from Perigean.*

*Action item: Add tokens to differentiate the different cohorts in the card sort and create distinct links for each cohort. Add links below.*

## Recruitment	

Ask Perigean to recruit **60** people using the cohorts below in order to get at least **30** completes. Ideally, we would like to get about 
- 2/3 (20 of 30) Veterans and 1/3 (10 of 30) caregivers of Veterans
- 1/2 (15 of 30) with experience using some VA benefits/services and 1/2 without such experience but interest in some

### For everyone:
- ALL have a computer and are willing to use it to complete the activity
- ALL are willing to do an activity that requires dragging and dropping items on their computer screen (NO screen reader users)
- At least 10 women
- Diversity across age groups
- Diversity across racial identities
- Diversity across education levels
- Diversity across rural and major metropolitan areas

### For Cohort A (9 Veterans)
- All must have experience with VA health care 

### For Cohort B (9 Caregivers)
- All must have experience with one or more of the following VA benefits or services: health care, education, career services, disability, housing, pension, life insurance, or burial 

### For Cohort C (9 Veterans)
- All have NO experience with VA benefits or services but are interested in some 

### For Cohort D (9 Veterans)
- All have experience with VA disability compensation

### For Cohort E (9 Caregivers)
- All have NO experience with VA benefits or services but are interested in some 

### For Cohort F (9 Veterans)
- All must have experience with VA education benefits or career services

### For Cohort G (9 Veterans)
- All must have experience with one or more of the following VA benefits or services: housing, pension, life insurance, or burial benefits

### Coordination with Perigean
To assess potential participants' experiences with VA benefits or services, please use their answers to the Digital Service at VA User Research Participant Recruiting Screener Questionnaire question *Which VA benefits or services do you have any experience with?"*

For potential participants who don't have any experience with VA benefits or services, the recruitment emails we provide will ask for interest in VA benefits or services.

We will provide an [outreach email template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/outreach-emails.md) and a unique card sort activity link for Perigean to use when reaching out to each cohort of potential participants. 

We will include a required field at the beginning of the card sort to collect a code from each participant. We expect Perigean to generate and provide a unique code to each participant for tracking completion and compensation. In order to minimize abandonment, please make very clear to participants that they need to use this code when they start the card sort. 

We estimate it will take participants 15-20 minutes *(need to verify!)* to complete the card sort.

## Timeline
- The card sort will be open for at least 2 weeks starting on Feb XX, and should remain open until there are 30 completes.

### Prepare
- The card sort link will be tested by several people on DATE TBD.
