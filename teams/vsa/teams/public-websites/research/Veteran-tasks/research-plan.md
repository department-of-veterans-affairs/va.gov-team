# Research Plan for Veteran Top Tasks, Public Websites, Feb X, 2022

## Background
The current design of the VA.gov home page provides easy access to some Veteran tasks in four boxes near the top of the page. [User research on the home page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-readout-full-June8.pdf) has shown that other tasks are more challenging to do when starting from the home page. 
We would like to learn which tasks Veterans most want to do on VA.gov.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme): 
- Increase the usage and throughput of VA services

### Veteran Journey
Veteran tasks fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) throughout 
- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life 
- Retiring and aging 

## Research Goals	
The goal of this research is to identify Veteran top tasks. We hope to find a set of 10-12 tasks that are most important from an initial set of about 30 tasks.

### Outcome
The top tasks that we identify could be used to measure the overall health of VA.gov. By running baseline usability tests and then regular tests at intervals, we can check whether Veterans can quickly and easily complete all top tasks.

### Research questions
1. When Veterans and others visit VA.gov, what tasks are most important to them? 
2. What tasks are least important? 
3. Are there any tasks that are unclear or confusing?
4. Are there any important tasks missing?

### Hypotheses
1. Veterans (and caregivers of Veterans) will generally agree on which tasks are the most important.
2. Veterans (and caregivers of Veterans) will generally agree on which tasks are the least important.

## Method	
Starting from a list of about 30 tasks synthesized from colleagues, the VA.gov home page, user research studies, and top VA site searches, we will put together an online card sort activity on Optimal Workshop. Veterans will rate the importance of each task for themselves only (not for all Veterans) by sorting it into one of several fixed categories (i.e., very important, somewhat important, not important, I don't understand this task). They will also be able to add new tasks and sort them, as well.

We would like to get complete sorting responses from **at least 30 Veterans and Caregivers**, with  
- **20 unmoderated** in distinct cohorts of fewer than 10 participants per cohort (per PRA)
- **10 moderated** sessions via Zoom

The purpose of the moderated sessions is to gather qualitative feedback on the tasks and their relative importance. 

*Action item: Synthesize and remove duplicates from tasks collected to get down to a list of ~30 tasks.*

*Action item: Get access to the new VSA account for Optimal Workshop from Yana or Shawna.*

*Action item: Create card sort in Optimal Workshop with a question for participants to provide their unique code, and then generate separate links for each recruitment cohort and add below.*

## Recruitment	

### For UNMODERATED online activity
Ask Perigean to recruit **40** people using the cohorts below in order to get at least **20** completes.

#### For everyone:
- ALL have a computer and are willing to use it to complete the activity
- ALL are willing to do an activity from their computer that requires dragging and dropping items on their computer screen (NO screen reader users)
- At least 8 women
- Diversity across age groups
- Diversity across racial identities
- Diversity across education levels
- Diversity across rural and major metropolitan areas

#### For Cohort A (9 Veterans)
- All must have experience with VA health care, education benefits, or career services

#### For Cohort B (9 Caregivers or Family Members of Veterans)
- All must have experience with one or more of the following VA benefits or services: health care, education, career services, disability, housing, pension, life insurance, or burial

#### For Cohort C (9 Veterans)
- All have NO experience with VA benefits or services but are interested in some (will ask in recruitment email)

#### Cohort D (9 Veterans)
- All have experience with VA disability, housing, pension, life insurance, or burial benefits

#### Cohort E (9 Caregivers or Family Members of Veterans)
- All have NO experience with VA benefits or services but are interested in some (will ask in recruitment email)

#### Coordination with Perigean
We will provide an [email template]() for Perigean to use when reaching out to each cohort of potential participants. 

We will include a required field at the beginning of the card sort to collect a code from each participant. We expect Perigean to generate and provide a unique code to each participant for tracking completion and compensation. In order to minimize abandonment, please make very clear to participants that they need to use this code when they start the card sort. 

We estimate it will take participants 15-20 minutes *(need to verify!)* to copmlete the card sort.

*(SAVE somewhere else: would like ~14 Veterans and 6 Caregivers or Family Members, half with experience using VA benefits/services and half w/o)*


### For MODERATED sessions over Zoom

Ask Perigean to recruit **15** people in order to get **10** completed sessions using the criteria below.

#### Primary criteria (must-haves)
- 10 are Veterans

- 7 have experience with one or more of the following VA benefits or services: health care, education or career services, disability benefits, housing benefits, pension, life insurance, or burial benefits
- At least 2 people 55 or older
- At least 2 people with a cognitive disability (e.g., TBI)
- ALL have a computer and are willing to use it to join our Zoom call (not a phone)
  - All have a working microphone on their computer, or are willing to also join from their phone for a microphone and speaker 
  - All have the Zoom app downloaded to their computer prior to the session and know how to share their screen
  - During the session, all are willing to share their browser window over Zoom

#### Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)
- At least 2 people of color
- At least 3 women
- At least 1 person 35 or under
