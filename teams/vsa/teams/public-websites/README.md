#### ZenHub Team Board

* Icebox: These are items that are eithier blocked indefinately or awaiting added functionality that is dependent on another team or section of VSP/VSF.  No need to touch these items until that are moved to Backlog or Ready Status.   
* Backlog: These are items that are eithier waiting for other dependencies or team just don't have bandwidth to action these items due to current velocity and burndown requirements.  Items in backlog can be picked up if there's nothing in ready, current sprint, or in-progress respectively. 
* Ready: These are items that ideally have been groomed and are ready on-deck tickets for team to work as directed.  These are things that are not in current sprint, but if bandwidth is available and all items in current sprint or in-progress are compelted then these can be pick items up for work.  
* Current Sprint: These are tasks that have been groomed and planned and programmed for completion as priority during sprint. These items can be moved to in-progress when initiated to indicate they are "Inprogress". Having tasks in current sprint indicates to team members that these items would idealy be completed before end of sprint. If there is nothing in-progress, this is the first column to look at when picking up new items.
* In Progress: These are tasks that are currently "Inprogress" or have PRs open. Some tickets merit more than 1 PR (e.g. maybe there's a backend PR and a frontend PR for the same ticket). When all related PRs are closed for the ticket, the ticket should be moved to the validate column for review and validation by PO/PM. 
* Validate: All assigned tasks are completed and Acceptable Criteria (AC) has been achieved along with related PRs being merged (not necessarily deployed). These tickets are ready for validation and (following the next deploy cycle) should be able to see the relevant changes on production/staging. **All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PO or PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.**

#### Issue Etiquette
**For Requests originating outside the Public Websites team** - please use our [Intake Form](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=lunascoop&labels=vsa-public-websites%2C+vsa%2C+vsa-public-websites-intake%2C+needs-grooming%2C+Epic&template=public-websites-intake.md&title=%3CType+of+Request%3E+from+%3CTeam%3E)

For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the [Standard Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=standard-issue.md&title=):

- Estimate
- Title that explains task
- Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
- Labels: _your team's labels_ 
- User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
- Nested in an Epic

All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

#### Team Norms

- Be on time and present for programmed meetings
- Be respectful, both online and off
- Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
- Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
- We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
- Strive for oppurtunties to collaborate 
- Assume best intentions - especially when in a remote setting
- Trust one another and ask questions freely and frequently
- Celebrate the wins
- Let’s have fun and do great work!

#### Estimating:
Thought process:

- 1: Easy task, work is known, can be executed quickly
- 2: Mostly known, doable
- 3: Becoming complex
- 5: Complex, may take a half a sprint
- 8: Pretty complex, takes up to a full sprint
- 13: Very complex, needs to be broken down. Consider spike/ discovery?

#### Decision Etiquette
Decisions are part of our daily routine, the below questions can help kickstart the decision making and creative thinking process.
1. Is it my decision to make?
2. Do I have all the information to make the decision?
3. Do I have to make the decision now?

#### Communication Best Practices 
- Slack - best communication method
- Slack channels allow us to do our work in the open so that others can learn from the questions asked and the answers provided. Please do the same.
- VFS teams should use public Slack channels as their first method of communication.
- Don't wait to organize a meeting to ask a question; this will slow our team down.
- Email - least effective communication method (Email communications are not easily searchable or archivable. Use this as a last resort for communication.)

#### Slack:
#vsa-public-websites

#### GitHub
label: vsa-public-websites

#### General things
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
