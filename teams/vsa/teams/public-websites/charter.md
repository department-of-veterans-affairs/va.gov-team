### **Issue Etiquette**
For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):

Estimate
Title that explains task
Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
Labels: vsa-caregivers
User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
Nested in an Epic
All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

### **Estimation**
Estimation is not based on how long something will take to complete, but is rather a combined rating encompassing risk, level of effort (LOE), and complexity.

1 - Easy task, work is known, can be executed quickly  
2 - Mostly known, doable   
3 - Becoming complex  
5 - Very complex, may take a full sprint or longer  
8 - Needs to be broken down into smaller user stories  

### **Team Norms**

  * Be respectful, both online and off
  * Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
  * Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
  * We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
  * Let’s have fun and do great work!

**And some logistics:**

Keep as much Slack conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.
GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.
Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to an issue or useful to document, copy them into GitHub.
Our tickets/issues have an estimated level of effort, clear acceptance criteria, and an individual or team assignee before being put in a sprint.
Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
