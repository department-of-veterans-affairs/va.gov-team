- [ ] [Discovery] Optimize VA.gov component creation #12320
- [ ] [Discovery] Generate "tech debt" opportunities #7790
- [ ] [DISCOVERY] Send to Mobile R&S Enhancement #20331
- We’ve learned through big data reviews that Veterans are largely using Mobile/Tablet to interact with R&S content and could likely benefit from a “Send to Mobile” for key content articles in an effort to better consume VA content in support of benefit questions and self guided learning.
- [ ] [Discovery] Recommend/Share via email/mobile feature [Needs Ticket]
- We believe that Veterans love helping Veterans and could benefit from an article ‘recommend/share’ feature in future iterations.  This could help increase content confidence through helping more Veterans better understand the benefits they have earned. 
- [ ] [CLP Design] CLP background alternating panel color to optimize UX [new ticket]
- [ ] [Discovery] Chatbot - look into COVID chatbot learnings before implementation into R&S (New Researcher work)
