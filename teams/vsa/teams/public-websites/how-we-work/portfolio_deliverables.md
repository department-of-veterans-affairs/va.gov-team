# Unauth Portfolio Checklist

These are the building blocks which we are putting in place to foster consistency and collaboration across the unauth teams - Public Website, Search and Decision Tools.

## Foundational

- [X] **[How We Work Principles](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/how-we-work)** - Will be used to communicate product owner v. product manager roles, our standard work process, etc.
- [ ] **Team Charter & GH Document Repository** (e.g. [Search team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa/teams/search-discovery)) - Along with the team charter, this is where you will find the team's roster, ceremonies schedule, key artifacts including details about product line scope and annual roadmap documents.
- [ ] **Product Folders** - For each product managed by a team, there should be a separate, intuitively labeled GH folder in the master [Product directory](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products).  And within each Product folder, there should be well organized sub-folders with key artifacts. A standard approach to this sub-folder taxonomy would be:
   - Discovery/Research
   - Design
   - Product Outline & Requirements
   - Meeting Notes & Decisions
   - Technical
   - Analytics
   - Post MVP Releases (with more sub-folders)

## Planning & Executing the Work

- [X] **Sprint Ceremonies** 
- [X] **Sprint Planning/Grooming Approach** - For unauth, we will adopt [this sprint plan approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/18941) to ensure meeting efficiency and reduce coginitive demand as the PO transitions from one team ceremony to the next.  For Grooming, we will use [this template.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/Grooming.md)
- [ ] **Quarterly Planning Approach** - A "working" six sprint planning sheet in the same format as a [single sprint plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/18941).
- Mural version - https://app.mural.co/t/vsa8243/m/pubweb1445/1608311310028/52bac376793a7c66326264d954f27d50ac023ae8

- [ ] **Annual Roadmapping Planning Approach** 
   - The PO will leverage Mural for:
      - [Roadmap workshop sessions with each team](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1611084100918/11d270b2efd9c9685720ccfe4ae96ea84f63ed4f)
      - [Communicating the roadmap](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1606233302345/7ce4ecc84a8d04a12dd3de0ef33600ea86611aad) with the teams, OCTO-DE product crews and leadership and key VA stakeholders
   - The roadmap will be translated this into various formats for broader sharing -- PPT Slide, GH table, etc.

## Measuring the Impact

- [X] **Product Analytics** - For each product, set up the following:
     - Google Analytics Dashboard
     - DOMO Dashboard 
- [X] **OKR/KPI Roadmap** For unauth, we will adopt [this approach](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zL6tkV54BDAP4GSu9ceMPccowdqQor1ldaHHGPtoyt8/edit).
- [ ] **Impact Reviews & Team of Teams Read-outs** 
- [ ] **Monthly Product Performance Sessions** - Reports should be auto-emailed to product team-members and key stakeholders.
