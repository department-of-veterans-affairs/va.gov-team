`WIP - this document will be freely evolving`
## UX Design Notes
eBenefits Design Team Members will be self-organizing and collabrative. This document intends to codify some of the process as it moves forward through the product portfolio within eBenefits.

## Considerations
We have a great userbase to ask questions from with great cases for consolidation of lots of different interfaces.  Some of our tasks will be repackaging for migration and we need to meet the minimum level of service.  Other items will require top to bottom research and have a much more service design level of effort.  Deciding which, for the most part, will become more apparant as we dig in and collaborate.

## Process
We need to discern the needs vs the fluff sooner rather than later within the big picture.  We should document a process that encompasses the different types of tasks we will be touching.  This can include investigation and have more than one phase but it will be most helpful to have some documentation in order to take advantage of previous work.  Don't want to reinvent the wheel :) Issues can be created in the backlog for better visibility and tracking as we move forward.  Remember, use our label `vsa-ebenefits`.

Start with initial impresssions, compare with priorities, consult with time frames, iterate on assesments on a per-product basis while remembering the big picture.

## Pilot Tasks
`once this gets better fleshed out, we can create some concrete stories around them`
- [ ] Lets do a more comprehensive overall sitemap (IA?)
- [ ] Where is the previous research?  
  - _Didn't really exist at the time, may need to be redone_
- We should talk to users
  - [ ] Establish who and how that happens

**Defined Steps**
`Jim, Aricka, you all had mentioned some discrete steps here, lets codify them, even if general`
1. Make a list
2. Define some general steps for Discovery

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Gather input and feedback from team on on what initial steps to take, expand as necessary
