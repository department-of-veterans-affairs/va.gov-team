Unknown 0:02
All right, and we are recording now, so. Do I have your permission to record this session.

Unknown 0:09
Yes you did.

Unknown 0:10
Thank you, appreciate them to start out if you wouldn't mind telling us just a little bit about yourself. Primarily service experience in the theater general experiences would be.

Unknown 0:22
Yeah, so I served in the Marine Corps for 28 years retired as a colonel commanded at the battery Squadron and a group well was Chief of Staff of two wings or as a to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs in the Pentagon upon retirement I was selected to be the president of a company in New York and I ran a publicly traded company for nine years in upstate New York that did primarily government contracting in the communications field. My experience with the VA is somewhat limited I've been on one or two of these calls previously I enjoy providing feedback. I appreciate what you all trying to do regarding the website I find

Unknown 1:01
the website is very difficult,

Unknown 1:02
and my other experiences really been primarily with hearing aid audio support. As a general rule at this time.

Unknown 1:12
Okay. Sounds like you are very well qualified to give us feedback on what we're trying to do here with the website. Have you heard of chapters, 31 and 36, and have you ever applied for those benefits.

Unknown 1:27
No, I'm not familiar

Unknown 1:27
with that. Okay. For your resume I would expect that you probably never had to make use of those. And just in the broadest terms chapter 3136 or vocational training career educational sorts of benefits. So, a service member or veteran who is transitioning out of service, or is, you know, out and would like some counseling or some sort of plan about getting training, making themselves more employable. Those sorts of things. So,

Unknown 2:00
may I may I comment Jim trickin, I would say that the military and the VA in general has probably led us down in that regard, I found that when I retired. I understand stood that I had some access to some education benefits, but it was woefully diminished on what those were, and then how long they lasted. And I think the VA, and the military would be well served. If they would set and I'm thinking, obviously, to some of our younger military people, and they would send reminders to them, annually that hey you have this benefit and this benefits going to expire on date certain, as opposed to it almost feels like they don't want to use the benefit because it's not well known what those benefits

Unknown 2:45
are right. It's actually very good feedback we to have interaction with stakeholders who run these programs. So comments like that we we collect them we surface them so I'll, I'll make a note of that. And then as far as what we actually have control over is weakened, potentially cramp the language, so that the reader has a better sense of what's going on. So, I think we're having any sort of comments regarding that. As you go through and read some of the stuff. Certainly, we'd like to hear that too because it's valuable feedback. Okay, okay. All right, so what I'm gonna do at this point is move into the session itself. We're going to do a couple of things. One, we're going to look@va.gov the homepage, and just take a quick look at that before we go to the prototype. So you're familiar with screen sharing. Right. Yes, which means sharing your screen for us. Sure. And then after you get that going. Go to va.gov.

Unknown 3:46
Do you have my screen now. I do not see

Unknown 3:49
it yet, sir.

Unknown 3:56
So, I hit share screen and let's see.

Unknown 4:01
There we go, we get to him.

Unknown 4:04
Alright, so you want me to go to va.com. Yes, sir.

Unknown 4:12
One of the questions we typically ask is what browser you're using but I can tell you using Safari on the Mac, just a couple of quick things about how the project site presents, in that it collapses on the spacing. It doesn't doesn't render the page unusable but they're just a couple of visual courts So, okay, you might notice that but it's one of the, one of the issues with this particular browser and just prototype. Okay, so now we're on vitarka. Okay, we're going to, you know, given, given your history in your background at this point, we're just going to say that you've heard VA offers education and training benefits may help you get a job. You go to va.gov. And could you take a look at the home screen, and tell us where you would go, and what you would do to try to find those benefits.

Unknown 5:03
I see a box on the website education. And I would, would go to that box immediately. Okay. And then I would look to see it looks like there's two that I might focus on compare GI Bill benefits by school, and then apply for education benefits I guess I would apply first to see what my benefits were so I understood that.

Unknown 5:29
Okay, if you could just go ahead and do whatever you would do. Okay.

Unknown 5:35
Apply for the education benefits.

Unknown 5:38
All right.

Unknown 5:40
And then I'm going to scroll down here how to apply.

Unknown 5:45
How do I prepare before starting.

Unknown 5:49
And then what up what do I need How Do I have time.

Unknown 5:56
So I guess to keep the conversation going. I would, I would obviously read some of the background waves engineer on how to apply what happens afterwards. But if I was ready to apply. How do I prepare before starting my application that sequence seems reasonable. Because sequence looks pretty good there.

Unknown 6:23
Nothing arts about training or education.

Unknown 6:29
Or let's say job readiness.

Unknown 6:33
Yeah, that's not jumping out at me.

Unknown 6:38
All right, if you wouldn't mind just go really quick back to the home screen.

Unknown 6:43
When it looks like a lot of a lot of steps may be to get to the issue at hand under that model. Okay. You want to go back home what.

Unknown 6:52
No sir, You're good, right here. If you were looking specifically or you knew that somebody was talking to you about chapter 31 or 36, you would have heard that I'm looking at this page is there anything that jumps out of you. Is there any key, how would you try to find chapter 3146 benefits.

Unknown 7:11
I guess I would have to go up to the search box here. And I would type that in. Because I don't see it, it's not as obvious anywhere else. Okay.

Unknown 7:27
That's perfect if you would just click search on that must be the last thing we do on the home screen. Okay.

Unknown 7:42
Then I would go to this VR II here. Chapter 31, that's the first one that would, I would recognize on the topic I was looking for.

Unknown 7:53
So with chapter 3136 in mind is this what you would expect to find. And can you find anything on this page that would allow you to apply

Unknown 8:04
as to how to apply length as an eligibility link. But again, going back to the initial comment if this was something that I was entitled to and I want it I would prefer to see something upfront under the education section. That would make that more intuitive. Okay.

Unknown 8:32
All right. I said, Is this what you would expect, let's say you you've gotten this far and maybe you have this link right here on home page, and you were able to land on this is, does this meet your expectation, what would you do next to apply. You don't have to actually do it just to show you something he pointed out,

Unknown 8:48
I just want to look through here how to apply. How do I apply if I already have.

Unknown 9:04
I mean the questions are, are good, pre questions but I don't see anything that says, Okay, I'm good with all that I just want to apply and many will apply. That's not instinctive to me here looking at it, it's more about how to apply and it's not obvious to jump right in to apply, I don't see anything that I guess Cody, he benefits to apply would be the screen hot button here.

Unknown 9:30
Okay, great. I really appreciate your feedback on that so we've got your general impression. And next step. If you can locate the chat. This is where we're going to get to the prototype itself. So I appreciate you going through that with us, when the game is giving you a link. And if you could, you can close out of view.gov. Now, if you could click on that link,

Unknown 10:01
call that

Unknown 10:04
back on the zoom page now.

Unknown 10:08
And you're looking for. I think I

Unknown 10:13
was gonna say pasted a link in the chat box. So if you can find a little phrases or the icon that says chat, click on that should open up

Unknown 10:24
the I clicked on the blue chat box, and it says start chat, chatting by clicking no creating a chat on the left panel.

Unknown 10:34
Is there an icon at the bottom of the screen somewhere in, let's say towards the bottom, middle

Unknown 10:42
mouse down.

Unknown 10:44
Now, and usually I'm familiar with this because I do I'm on a couple points but we use them quite a bit.

Unknown 10:50
But maybe there's something going on here.

Unknown 10:54
I'm gonna go back to home for a second on this part.

Unknown 11:01
Back to meeting.

Unknown 11:12
Work with this issue of personal space, what's on your mind. I'm going to just put test in here and

Unknown 11:19
see if that

Unknown 11:21
goes,

Unknown 11:23
not seeing it in the zoom chat.

Unknown 11:27
Let's see if you click on that zoom icon, that's in your dock. Okay,

Unknown 11:34
it should take you straight to zoom.

Unknown 11:37
Okay, I think

Unknown 11:39
you're rolling your mouse down towards the bottom. I believe there is a bar, that should show up. Just mouse down. And there should be something in the window that says chat, although I'm not seeing it on your screen.

Unknown 11:57
Now,

Unknown 11:59
this is the zoom screen I want right here it is and it

Unknown 12:03
is there, it is you

Unknown 12:04
can see where I clicked and said test right.

Unknown 12:08
Maybe there's a way to get to it. Let's see view under view in the menu bar where it says zoom meeting view,

Unknown 12:16
you can click on View.

Unknown 12:19
Let's see if it'll show you the chat that way. So it's in the upper left prolapsed. I'm gonna jump to. Right.

Unknown 12:31
All files,

Unknown 12:33
the menu bar itself the gray bar at the top where it says zoom.

Unknown 12:36
Oh up on the top. Okay, up there I have home chat meetings and contacts.

Unknown 12:42
Okay, I see what you were seeing others from Nancy what you're seeing. Do you see the menu bar where it says Zoom. US next to the Apple icon, and it's up in the upper left hand corner. It's at the top of the screen the gray one at the top of the window. I can actually see it on your screen.

Unknown 13:03
Oh I see, okay, all the way on my screen yep on that.

Unknown 13:07
Or you can go over to view. Okay, we can then show chat.

Unknown 13:14
There we go. Okay.

Unknown 13:18
Okay, there's there's always you know all roads lead to Rome, there's always,

Unknown 13:22
if you see the link can you please click on that, it'll launch your browser and bring up the prototype.

Unknown 13:27
Okay, here we go.

Unknown 13:38
Okay, now. The purpose of this scenario where we're going to just lay out for you the, this is the chapter 36 screen that you might come to, once we migrate the feature.

Unknown 13:50
I say no but somebody

Unknown 13:52
told you Hey, going to be a apply for benefits. Looking at this page, what would you do to find out if you're eligible.

Unknown 14:03
I would scroll down here. And it looks like I would be able to just start clicking and

Unknown 14:10
by answering one of the few of these questions here.

Unknown 14:16
Okay. I was fairly

Unknown 14:17
straightforward up, probably. It might be overstated at some point but it's apply for personalized career planning, and guidance and maybe benefits

Unknown 14:28
is what I would say, Okay, that's good feedback route, we're actually looking for keywords that the users would actually look for, well take a look at this phone most onsie most, a lot of it is actually clickable. So do what you would do to try and find out your eligibility. Okay. And go ahead and answer these questions as if you were you, I save okay without scenario mind and I'll redirect you with, you know, maybe a change

Unknown 14:59
in our robot. So which of these describes you I said veteran, and then are you receiving chapter 31 benefits. I would say I would, are you receiving chapter 31 V or a benefits at this time, I would say no. Okay. Just to add a little clarity, are you using VA educational benefits to go to school again I'd say, at this time. And I would say now. Okay. Have you or your sponsor been discharged from active duty service in the last year and you have less than six months in total discharge. It's really confused me because I wouldn't necessarily understand why I now have sponsor, because that hasn't been defined to me. And so that might become a hurdle for me. Have you or your sponsor I don't know who my sponsor would be would I be dependent but for me, that would be a little bit of a hurdle right there.

Unknown 15:56
It's really a feedback. So you kind of hit it on the head. If you were a dependent, you'd have a sponsor so this question applies to them, in part,

Unknown 16:07
so that's good feedback, we'll take that

Unknown 16:10
as you read through this last year. And I do have less than, in the last year so that would have to be defined that is less 12 months, previous to this a little clarity on that. What do you have less than six months until discharged until discharge until dishonorably discharged maybe Yep. And then I would say.

Unknown 16:37
In my case, I would say no to that. Okay.

Unknown 16:42
Must be discharged from active duty so that gives me my answer then I wouldn't

Unknown 16:46
qualify, looking at this.

Unknown 16:48
Okay, so you feel like that is an answer haven't gotten through that.

Unknown 16:52
Yes, the My only concern would be the last year because a lot of times you go to websites, who define what the year was is it known in the backdrop of the computer, or is it defined as the calendar year that you're currently in just,

Unknown 17:07
just a comment. Okay. No, that's perfect we have content people that worry about that sort of thing a lot. So your can be calendar you're saying or it can be like the last 12 months so we need to let people know

Unknown 17:18
right 12 months effective from the date you're reading the screen because the computer can run an analog that knows that you're looking at it on September 28 or, or is it like you're trying to work for a fiscal year or calendar year.

Unknown 17:32
Right. Well for this. The purpose of going forward, if you were, we'll go ahead and have you say yes to that. And we'll just pretend like you're within a year of discharge. Okay.

Unknown 17:43
You like to apply for career planning and kindness benefits, now.

Unknown 17:49
Yes.

Unknown 17:51
And then I will click on apply for career planning and guidance and again I little repetitive but i'd added benefits on there as well. Okay. it's just, it's already done this but. Okay, so I've clicked on that require for the personalized career planning and guidance benefits. Okay. And this is, this is an easy way to navigate for sure.

Unknown 18:16
Great. So having come to this screen. What's your impression what's going on here.

Unknown 18:22
Some of it may be the anomaly, like you said, of the driver I'm using there's something going on with you could see my screen with the words, I can pull it. And the third bullet. When you're signed into your VA government account, which That in itself can be challenging. I know for me right

Unknown 18:43
yeah I'm saying that as

Unknown 18:45
I can read so we run the session. Yeah, we were working to consolidate all the logins and stuff but

Unknown 18:52
yet it's a mess. It's an absolute mess. So we can pre fill part of your application based on your, your account details. I would have checks in front of those things you can save the create some action it's either an open box I have to do it, or it's a check that you would tell me you can do it. Okay.

Unknown 19:14
So looking at this screen, and having come here through the series of questions, if you wanted to apply what would you do next.

Unknown 19:22
I stopped because there's no if you sign in after you've started your application or appear to save the information you've already filled in. Okay. And that would bother me. Because a lot of times you get into these applications and if you don't have everything with you that you need. It can be a waste of your time so unless you're going to tell me exactly what I need before I sit down to do it. I probably would not want to jump into it, since it can't be saved so it would be neat if it can be saved. CP go back in and finish it later. And I have pretty good 60 days from the date you start or update your application but so That's ironic you can update your application, but you can't save it so

Unknown 20:07
I'm already good point. Well, I'm looking at the at the screen because what I'm hearing is that this thing kind of creates just a sense of mistrust. Like, who do I go ahead but then I try to say but I don't have what I need, that sort of thing. Right. And you scroll the rest of the page and see some of your questions or concerns are addressed.

Unknown 20:32
I say, Okay.

Unknown 20:42
Yeah, that sounds awful, but without rolling down I might not have seen that

Unknown 20:47
Smitty you'll get a confirmation.

Unknown 20:57
You know, just a thought I mean, people that serve in the military they understand things like phases and stages. And, if these had a phase, phase one is the prepare phase, phase two, is the apply phase and then within the apply phase. There's these subsets that you have to do that can be either number a sequence of a sequence kind of person. And so there might be some value in trying to make sure that the sequencing is really ordered correctly if that makes sense.

Unknown 21:31
It does make sense. Yeah, so it's kind of like, You better establish a hierarchy and maybe use some, some terminology that you would recognize.

Unknown 21:40
Yeah, for example, Jim like the bullet. Apply number two. So the third bullet that says complete this form first, which form. Is it the line above it, or is it this the first Lyons has completed his career planning and guidance form. And so, which form is it I guess it's the form, VA Form 28 1900, but it's it's a sequencing issue. Right.

Unknown 22:07
So your expectation The form is referencing is the link down below.

Unknown 22:11
That's what I'm assuming. But if I'm going to do that then I think that link should be further up so that's where I go back I'm saying repetitive but I think sequencing can help minimize the challenges for people

Unknown 22:24
working through these things. Right. It's a, it's an important consideration. And that's, that's one of the design patterns that we're looking for with these forms is trying to come up with something that is going to more universally clarify what's going on, but stepping backs very important. When looking at the screen and and expecting that one or another these things are going to take you to the formatting allow you to apply. What would you do next. I would click on

Unknown 22:53
this, apply online with VA Form 28 1900.

Unknown 22:58
Okay,

Unknown 23:00
encourage you that. Okay.

Unknown 23:09
Now, is this what you expected to find when you clicked on that.

Unknown 23:13
No, because now I'm right back to the command string reflections again, to find out if this is the right form I thought I already did that. So it feels a little redundant. But that may be built upon the way I answered the previous

Unknown 23:31
questions but, but, you

Unknown 23:34
know, it seems like I'm going back into answering questions again which of these describes you okay veteran Did you receive better than a dishonorable discharge. I think those questions could have been on a previous screen. Because I think I would have been kicked out. If I did receive better than a dishonorable discharge. I would have been filtered out on the screen before this. Right. Okay, what

Unknown 23:58
would you click next then going through this and just following it through. Could you receive

Unknown 24:03
better than a dishonorable discharge Yes. Okay.

Unknown 24:09
Yes.

Unknown 24:15
Interesting question are you within 12 years of your active duty separation day or killing your first VA disability rating. That's cumbersome. That's awkward. Cuz you're not going to get a VA disability rating. Until you separate right within 12 years that would stop me I'd be like, so I'm on a 20 year career path. So a year eight I'm filling this out or a year 10, that that has some confusion into the equation. Right,

Unknown 24:49
okay.

Unknown 24:50
There may be logic there but I don't see it.

Unknown 24:53
No, that's, that's perfectly fine. You know I'm following along what you've got here, we're making some notes about just this sort of thing language, because we look at it differently.

Unknown 25:03
You know, and, you know, fresh and we've been staring

Unknown 25:05
at it three months so these sorts of things are very valuable to us so that we get that language right and I find most of the time when we're working with forms is that language is the trigger point. Well, we're taking this to be, you know, our head view retired or discharged within the last 12 years what would you answer me.

Unknown 25:28
I would say yes. Okay. Would you like to apply. And again is the redundancy, this is the kind of stuff that starts to annoy me when I go to government sites because I figured the reason why would I be here finding one or applying for these benefits, and I answered that on the previous screen. Right, so it's, I'm not sure what that filtering is serving at this point. And I'm just I feel like I'm being stalled a little bit if you will, I don't mean to be mean but

Unknown 25:58
no no that's exactly what we need to hear, and I actually have some, some questions in my checklist that point to these sorts of things because we were going to pay special attention to that. Alright, if you wanted to apply them. What would your next step be,

Unknown 26:14
I'm gonna go to this green box. I like the color coding I like that it's green. I think we're gonna locate people they think green is go yellow is caution and red is a no Gov which is a metric system we often

Unknown 26:27
use in preparing for

Unknown 26:29
operations and such so that's, that's a good technique, that's good feedback too.

Unknown 26:35
And so you find yourself here. And what's your impression of what's going on now.

Unknown 26:40
Oh my god. Here we go again.

Unknown 26:43
I'm saying thanks thing, this I feel like I'm now on.

Unknown 26:47
It's like a tease that eventually you're going to have trees, sign up for it. Why didn't I just go right to it. Because if I sat down to do this, I'm being asked the same questions again, same comment about it I can update it. I probably would change the blue box to green, but I'd be asking why, why am I even on this screen. Okay, because I thought I already did this. That's my initial impression. Okay.

Unknown 27:15
Definitely is a phone with you I'm kind of feeling the same sort of issue. Looking at it.

Unknown 27:21
So,

Unknown 27:23
too. We've only got a couple of minutes left, we may actually go over a smidge which I can get you into the form and we can get your impression of

Unknown 27:31
what's here. Go ahead. Yeah, here again the whole this whole page though is almost a repeat endless cycle of another page I was already on

Unknown 27:40
it actually is. And just, kind of, I don't know if this will shed a little light but you kicked over into a different form you went to the 28 1900, but according to the wizard. It says that you are eligible. So now you've found yourself in a whole different form. You know, just to expedite things, if you wouldn't mind clicking and sign in.

Unknown 28:03
Yeah, so to that point then that should be more

Unknown 28:06
obvious, right. That's exactly what

Unknown 28:09
I'm thinking. That way they use just as well okay cool as that hurdle. I'm eligible, I passed the service disconnect connected disability I'm, I'm eligible I feel like I'm moving forward with that. Okay, I've clicked sign in

Unknown 28:23
and didn't work. Can you click sign in to start your application big blue button in the gray box, scroll down.

Unknown 28:29
I just want to add a sir.

Unknown 28:31
And again, I go green on that to be consistent.

Unknown 28:34
Okay. And just to get you in, go ahead and click on the green button, please. Okay. Okay. For the purpose of this, you've signed in, and you're Hector dolla Vera. Okay, so this is the first thing that you see. And this is the poem itself. So Wes, what are your feelings about what you see here.

Unknown 28:59
Well, first I feel like that's pretty limited information that you have, like, I want to see dates of service can validate that it's really made. What were the dates of my service what was my end of active service date, and what rank did I transition out at. Okay, I think if I'm a military member. I feel like you would know that on this side up repopulate that is what my guess would be. Okay,

Unknown 29:27
so maybe more comprehensive information just to verify this issue. Okay, next step be on this page. But assuming that what you see is correct.

Unknown 29:39
If you use, please call

Unknown 29:42
boy. Time to die of, if you need to update, please call I would hate that right there, right, that would be a black hole. So that would stop me in my tracks, I, if I needed to update it. I want to be able to do that right here on my own. Within reason obviously that might have to be some kind of validation of who I am with my dd 214 or something but

Unknown 30:08
that is something that we are actively talking about when it comes to the forum system so. But if it were correct what would your next step be.

Unknown 30:17
If my information was correct. I've encoded this.

Unknown 30:22
If I go to this continue button. Okay.

Unknown 30:30
Okay, one of four.

Unknown 30:34
Okay, so I'm still in step one.

Unknown 30:38
And this seems like it could be compressed to the point I made on the page previously. If you confirm this as who you are. We need to do that and fill this out but that's fine. It's okay like that. And then confirming your email that's all good. Main phone number. Main phone number his cell phone number. I don't know anybody seems anymore to has a main phone number everybody just seems to have cell phone number so it can be a little duplicity there. That goes, that's all pretty straightforward. I live on the United States military base, outside of the US the odds of that are slim if you're not in the military anymore but maybe there's a logic to that. And then I will continue to cook well let me do that without someone at Southern.

Unknown 31:30
Um, they are live but you can go ahead and continue.

Unknown 31:33
Okay, to a five.

Unknown 31:41
I think giving us information is optional, I would just say optional information. I don't think it's a little repetitive. We don't have this here we have recommendations for this again moment process. So, why would it be optional. If you're going to come back and ask me for it later. If you skip this page we don't have this information your record we may ask you for this again when we, why not just fill it out,

Unknown 32:14
but doesn't work all that hard to do. Right.

Unknown 32:18
That's that's good feedback to, to answer your questions specifically, these are based on paper forms, so some of the rules from the paper forums get translated. But to your point,

Unknown 32:30
you know, if you're here, it's

Unknown 32:31
easy, you know,

Unknown 32:33
why not write

Unknown 32:35
quickly. Okay, pretty straightforward. Sounds good.

Unknown 32:40
Would you. What number would you click in four years of education in your particular case.

Unknown 32:48
Yeah, so that's a great question because I like a drop down I have two master's degrees. So that I'd have to count on my fingers with two master's degrees at the same.

Unknown 32:57
Maybe in terms

Unknown 32:58
of 12, then I've got to do for for college so that's 16 and two for a Master's is 18, I think it would be easy just to do a drop down with GED High School associate's, bachelor's, master's doctorate, it just would seem to be an easy way to do it. All right, well if you

Unknown 33:21
would please just answer those two questions then Okay, then we'll do what or can

Unknown 33:27
do what you would do next and then I

Unknown 33:30
will be in the next 30 days I guess that would trigger a question in my mind I might want somebody to tell me what why is that, you know, this is required because it's going to move you to another city what what is that matter. Okay, I got it. So if I yes, it brings me into it. Okay, I dropped out or you will

Unknown 33:53
be in the next 30 days now. Continue

Unknown 33:59
Malaysia's preferences.

Unknown 34:03
What is your impression At this screen,

Unknown 34:06
first paragraph, just that I don't need all of that, I'm already filling out a form so I don't need to know that there's several options. I could just say options available for counseling. And so I think, you know, I worked for a colonel that told me I don't pay you by

Unknown 34:22
the word.

Unknown 34:24
Right. I think there's a little bit of a redundancy there. Okay. If you answer yes to that quote we will call email you with more or similar attractions with rescue

Unknown 34:40
IRS and using a VA. The I would say yes on that. Okay, maybe, maybe it's just a bit wordy. It could be pelletized a little bit. If that would be useful. Sure.

Unknown 34:57
Yeah you whenever your impressions are

Unknown 35:00
that we line them up against other users. Yeah. And it kind of paints a picture for us. And a lot of what you're saying lines up with what other users have said so. Okay, you're definitely not an outlier. And you're handing out some of the big problems when you fix people we go live so. Okay, so good feedback.

Unknown 35:22
So you're pausing you're reading the reading the teller counseling now. Yeah, sure.

Unknown 35:32
Okay. Yeah.

Unknown 35:38
But there again like just a minor point that first sentence right so it's just tell account same virtual communication tool. That's it. It's the teleconferencing virtual communication tool. And I don't need vre has. Doesn't matter. Just more bullets less, less wordy. Most people don't enjoy going on and doing things on computers so they're working through efficiencies and saving time is my impression. And if somebody were trying to do this. I think westwards always is helpful long as it makes sense. Are you interested in using, I would say yes.

Unknown 36:20
Good. Okay.

Unknown 36:30
Okay. Again VR and E will work hard to assign a counselor, please provide us preferred hours, we will do our best to support your availability. I mean, I probably cut half the words out. What isn't that that is one of the best times so what what are the best times is just somebody getting paid for it, that's for sure. Too much there then. Then, are those local times or does the computer automatically telethon Eastern Standard Time Central Standard Time, or do I have to convert it, and I wouldn't want to have to convert it, because that messes people up. Okay, so that doesn't come about. Do you want me to pick one of those.

Unknown 37:16
Yes sir, if you would please whichever is right. It doesn't matter which but that's good up back there to some clarification on time zones and, yeah, versus, you know, Washington.

Unknown 37:28
for for review as a service member.

Unknown 37:35
I'm not exactly sure what's going on here I am I then supposed to open this up, I guess. Okay, so I'm reviewing. I think what I'm trying to figure out is if there's an ask here. Though it's review application or is it. Please review. All these or do I just get to skip it. Additional information I'm just saying what. So those that may not be wider on that break open that up.

Unknown 38:09
Nope, you're doing exactly what we what you should and they are not like we only have one accordion

Unknown 38:14
that opens. Yes, for me it would be review your application and I wouldn't have three different things I would just all of that would be one review, which is good, has no problem with reviewing the application. And then I have read and.

Unknown 38:29
I'm sorry.

Unknown 38:31
I'm making a note here so you're looking for the verb, you're looking for the action, what do I do, yeah, I'm

Unknown 38:36
looking for an action review application, you know, and then I don't need I don't think I need three subsets of that. That would just be one big application review. I don't think I'd want anybody to skip any part of that. Right. And it appears that you almost have the choice to pick yours, your information your additional information or your communication preferences. Those should just, it's one application. And you should have all that reviewed before you submit.

Unknown 39:08
Okay, so you would enforce a review.

Unknown 39:11
Yes.

Unknown 39:12
All right, on the screen, having taken a look at the, you know, in your situation the closed Koreans just assume that they open, what would your next step be to

Unknown 39:23
follow through. I'm looking at the snow. Okay, make sure I'm not going to go to jail for misinformation.

Unknown 39:32
That's fine and

Unknown 39:34
now here it says the application has been saved, but previously. We couldn't save it. So, but then I would hit submit, because it looks like I've done everything I'm supposed to do at that point. So, when I hit submit. I guess what I'd be looking for Okay, here we go. Practice page for your records. And what I see Then I what exactly I have a printer here. So, what is it I'm printing that I get a number that's going to show up here, that's going to be my unique application number so when I call contravened. I would have a number, because I see no nothing here that's worth
