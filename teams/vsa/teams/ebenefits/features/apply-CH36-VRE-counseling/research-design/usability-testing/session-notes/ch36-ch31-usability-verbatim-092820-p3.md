All right, and if you would for the record, may I record this session.

Unknown 0:08
Yes, you may. Record the session.

Unknown 0:10
Thank you. Okay.

Unknown 0:13
So to start out, if you would please just tell us a little bit about yourself, maybe your service history, and any experiences that you've had with VA.

Unknown 0:24
Yes. Well I was 33 years in the Air Force and all components the active duty the Air Guard and the reserve. And I retired from the reserve in 2011. I was in the fourth class of women to fly and flow about half of my career and then was on the Air Staff and other assignments for the rest of it. I was injured in Somalia in 92. And that was a progressive consequence you know the injury itself didn't seem too bad, but then it got infected and then I got a virus and I still have that virus in my system.

Unknown 1:14
And that

Unknown 1:16
within a year of coming home, I started exhibiting symptoms joint, and sweat swelling and pain, various places. And they tested me for absolutely everything you know that that type of Gulf War syndrome was going on and tested for that they tested for other allergies or other known diseases and couldn't pinpoint it, and all along I thought it seemed like rheumatoid arthritis to me but they said I was too young, it couldn't be that. And finally, about a year and a half to two years later they did diagnose it as a very extreme form of rheumatoid arthritis, that's being really pumped up by this foreign virus that still is in my system. So, that of course is a, not only ongoing disease but a progressive disease so it's gotten worse over the years, but fortunately the drugs and treatments and knowledge about the disease have all gotten better so I'm maintaining pretty well. As long as I have access to the medications which this year has been a problem, this administration has cut out a lot of the military at least the retiree benefits regarding medical benefits, and two of my medications were two of them that they cut out. So that's been a struggle but the VA. I went to them and they kicked in and said well we can get you those medications and, and they have. So, I'm currently quite pleased with the VA.

Unknown 2:55
That's always good to hear.

Unknown 2:57
I'm glad that they were able to pinpoint what was going on and it sounds like, like the VA has been able to help. So that's great. Okay. Do you have any experience with chapter 31 or 36 benefits.

Unknown 3:13
Are they what they are, again,

Unknown 3:14
the Center on career counseling job readiness training.

Unknown 3:21
Career Planning, those sorts of things

Unknown 3:25
are the only experience I've had is.

Unknown 3:29
I tried to use my GI Bill a couple of times and got turned down both times. And for the field of study I wanted to take, they said was not authorized and yet friends of mine are doing very very similar things, and theirs were authorized so I don't quite know why I've never paid posts used by GI bill for that part of the VA hasn't turned out well for me.

Unknown 3:59
Concord so good on the one hand, some, some bad on the other GI Bill I believe is chapter 33 benefits but it's okay yeah it's in that sphere,

Unknown 4:08
definitely said career I thought maybe prayer training I thought maybe that came into it. But no, I mean, I had a full career in the military and also in industry so I've. In fact, I'm still working in industry as a consultant so I've my career has continued. Right, so you haven't really had to make use of why you, yeah.

Unknown 4:33
That doesn't disqualify you from walking through this because I mean with your background. You know, we like to get your feedback just the same. So, as we go through this, we'll have you go through as if you were to do. And then, if we do run into some sort of robot for whatever reason, you know, we'll change the scenario so that we can make it. Alright. Would you mind sharing your screen with us because the first thing we're going to do is go to va.gov.

Unknown 5:02
Oh, is that share screen, I turned on the video okay,

Unknown 5:06
different thing. All right. I hit share screen. Okay.

Unknown 5:16
Great. Now, if you would go to your feet.

Unknown 5:29
Thank you. Okay.

Unknown 5:32
So the first part of this is looking at the va.gov home screen. And assuming a scenario, you heard VA could help you find a job or get some kind of training. Maybe you've heard of chapter 31, a different chapter 36, looking at the homescreen, what would you do next to find out how to get help with jobs, or training or education and for planning career planning.

Unknown 6:00
Well there's a search function at the top I could use, I'm

Unknown 6:06
looking through these boxes.

Unknown 6:10
Well there's education that might help me with training, rest of it doesn't seem to be career oriented. Okay. Let's see down at the bottom has careers and employment and education and training. So I would look in those sections, I suppose. Okay.

Unknown 6:31
Whichever one you would be more inclined to do, go ahead and try that.

Unknown 6:35
All right, I would go for careers and employment.

Unknown 6:44
Okay.

Unknown 6:49
And then what am I looking for something specific, or just looking for help with a new career. Right, just in

Unknown 6:57
general, you're just looking for career planning guidance possible possibly help getting training, or job.

Unknown 7:05
Okay. Well,

Unknown 7:08
if I already knew what I wanted. There's the how to apply. But if I really was looking for help I would go to the educational and career counseling. Okay, and to try to find out what's. You know what's out there how I didn't know how to get started. Maybe they would help me, and how to get started.

Unknown 7:29
So you think that's a good catch all right they're

Unknown 7:33
like a good starting point for searching.

Unknown 7:37
Well I think so just by the name of it. Maybe it's not, but

Unknown 7:43
find out is what your, your thought processes.

Unknown 7:47
Excuse me, because we want to make sure that we've got the words and get the placement and everything crapped in just the right way so that you know people get to where they need to go quickly. Okay, if you would please just click on that.

Unknown 8:06
Apologies again and my voice is just shot already. Okay.

Unknown 8:17
So looking at this screen, and thinking that you could apply for benefits. What would you do next.

Unknown 8:34
Well, let's see.

Unknown 8:38
Again, if I really didn't know what I was looking for. It says counseling to help you decide which jobs you want, probably try to contact somebody there or look weed through that section. And who's eligible, I guess you know I'm eligible because I'm here

Unknown 9:02
in the VA.

Unknown 9:05
And then again the application process apply by mail, you know i i suppose I would start with

Unknown 9:10
what benefits,

Unknown 9:12
I can get how to choose the job I want, but I'm not seeing here how to actually get in touch with.

Unknown 9:20
Okay person to help. So you see information but

Unknown 9:23
you don't see a way to do anything,

Unknown 9:24
not immediately maybe there's

Unknown 9:31
a video.

Unknown 9:33
Yeah, yeah, that should be

Unknown 9:36
was counseling to help you decide what jobs you want

Unknown 9:41
educational career counseling, it should be a link here to like a counselor or a way to or information about a counseling counseling appointment.

Unknown 9:52
So we're going to list books there you would like to see a some sort of next step, or a link or an action item.

Unknown 10:00
Right. Why are you,

Unknown 10:03
well that's that is very good feedback, where we work with this particular page and others like it to get you in to the forums and get you into the features. But it's important to find out what your thought processes, get in here. So that's why we go through the exercise of taking it from all page. All right, the next thing I'm going to do then, is I'm going to give you in the chat. Can you find the chat box. There's an icon down at the bottom of the screen this is checked.

Unknown 10:33
Normally is but it's not coming up, let's see.

Unknown 10:39
Is it because I'm sure

Unknown 10:42
you might have to roll your mouse down to reveal

Unknown 10:45
it to have it well i have i've

Unknown 10:48
been rolling down and normally it's a bar at the bottom it's not coming up

Unknown 10:55
on my screen

Unknown 11:00
stuff at the top at the top doesn't have chat, or it says more, maybe. Okay, it went up to the top. And when you click on More than this chat, like a cat, or do you see

Unknown 11:13
a link, it's got a lot of numbers.

Unknown 11:17
Please click on that.

Unknown 11:25
This is the prototype, so it may look like a real website but only some things are clickable.

Unknown 11:41
So we're following the same scenario you've heard that VA can help you with career with training group planning, maybe in finding a job, and you've come to this screen.

Unknown 11:54
What would you do to find out if you were actually eligible,

Unknown 12:01
say, Well, I guess answer these questions because it says, Is this

Unknown 12:05
the form I mean, and

Unknown 12:07
then I guess if you answer the questions that will tell you. Okay.

Unknown 12:12
This is why, so do what you would expect to do if it's one of the real.

Unknown 12:25
And you can answer the questions as if you're you want to come to a stopping point I'll change the scenario.

Unknown 12:31
So I mean otherwise all fine.

Unknown 12:38
The big question actually. Do you know if you're receiving chapter 31 benefits.

Unknown 12:43
I would say no because I don't, because I'm not familiar with it but it doesn't you know.

Unknown 12:51
But no, I would say no.

Unknown 12:55
Yeah, let's do what you expected to do.

Unknown 13:00
Okay.

Unknown 13:10
So now you've come to this point, does this give you an answer about your eligibility, haven't gone through those questions.

Unknown 13:18
Well, yes I'm not eligible, and they should say that up front. If you haven't,

Unknown 13:23
retired less than six

Unknown 13:23
months ago, you're not eligible. Okay,

Unknown 13:27
it's actually very good feedback kind of bottom line approach.

Unknown 13:31
Exactly. Okay.

Unknown 13:34
All right, well let's just assume for the scenario that you have been discharged within the last year or so. So instead of answering now that you answered yes.

Unknown 14:01
Know why do they limit it to people just within six months because especially like now with a pandemic a lot of people who were employed now aren't, and they would like. Career Planning guidance.

Unknown 14:15
You bring up a very good point. It's a little bit outside our scope. We're working with the you know the programs as they exist. It's important to find out just what you're saying right there, we can serve to say we can bring it to two stakeholders and and see if they can escalate it. But we're kind of working within the rules, they've got right now. And so a lot of these programs have very well defined parameters. So, this is what Congress has approved this money for. And this is, this is the path that we need to take in presenting it. So, not a great answer to your question but it's kind of like the those are the rules at the moment. And it could be that other programs exist to kind of fill that gap. And it could be that some things you know some short term things are available. We don't really know. So we're presenting chapter 36 rules right now. But

Unknown 15:16
we can be helpful.

Unknown 15:18
Yes we can help

Unknown 15:21
those sorts of questions and that sort of feedback is very important so thank you for that. All right. Having looked at this, do you feel like having answered the questions with the exception of the you know the the 12 month, six month thing. Do you feel like you're eligible, having answered those questions and landed here.

Unknown 15:38
Oh, yes. Uh huh.

Unknown 15:41
So what would you do at this point if you wanted to continue to pursue receiving benefits.

Unknown 15:50
Well, I guess. I guess apply.

Unknown 15:55
All right, what does this mean he would let you do that. What, what on the page would let you apply.

Unknown 16:02
Well, a couple of places one is says sign in to start your application or second

Unknown 16:07
place without signing in,

Unknown 16:12
but then there is a place where to get help filling out your claim if you. Right. You can't do it yourself. And then the VA 4.8 900. So a couple places where you can sign in to start your application.

Unknown 16:30
Which one would you choose.

Unknown 16:34
Um, well if I had my sign in credentials with me I would do it that way. Otherwise I would start the application without

Unknown 16:42
signing in, for the purpose of their career time, we we've given you a fake name if you did,

Unknown 16:50
you can proceed that

Unknown 16:55
just discovered you are now Hector.

Unknown 17:01
So having signed in the page will change to this, looking at the screen that you have here. What would you do next.

Unknown 17:12
Oh, let's see, a late this group, violence, or do service connected disability Yes.

Unknown 17:23
So, also be available. vrma.

Unknown 17:31
So this is a complete this form first so because I have a service connected disability I would have to do that for first I guess

Unknown 17:39
that is actually very good feedback. What would your expectation be.

Unknown 17:47
What would you be inclined to do with what we were saying there.

Unknown 17:53
See, um,

Unknown 18:01
well I guess I would do though fill out the 20 1900 first. Okay.

Unknown 18:08
Because,

Unknown 18:10
the other one is have a VSO helped me fill out. Blame but I've already. So, this is a different claim right it's not your initial claim to get benefits,

Unknown 18:24
right, this would be a different benefit.

Unknown 18:26
Okay. Well,

Unknown 18:28
I guess, after I filled out the service connected form, then I would if I wanted to connect, contact the VSO to help with the application by probably try to do it myself first. Yeah,

Unknown 18:43
let's assume in this case that you feel confident going forward, and we'll save the BSNL for later. Okay. Step B then.

Unknown 18:53
So do you want me to go to the point 819 hundred or just click apply for career counseling,

Unknown 18:59
whichever of the two you would do, go ahead and click on.

Unknown 19:03
Well, this one I would have to do.

Unknown 19:09
Yeah, there's no right or wrong answer it's it feels kind of like, you know, like door number one door number two kind of thing.

Unknown 19:17
Yes.

Unknown 19:19
But there's nothing bested we're not going to be sending any information, so it's just a case of, you know, we want to find out what you think you should do. And then we can make adjustments to whatever we need to do. So you've come to the screen and you see a set of questions and you're now answering them. What made you do that. Um,

Unknown 19:42
well I guess because it was there ready to go. This is find out if this is the right form

Unknown 19:45
for you so as we just

Unknown 19:49
so I'm just doing this to make sure

Unknown 19:53
that I'm within 12 years of your

Unknown 19:55
separation day.

Unknown 19:56
Okay, well barely yes what happens at 12 years you can't use this anymore.

Unknown 20:04
Yes, now you're in the 20 1900 70 program so there's different rules and

Unknown 20:12
rules issue must be within 12 years of discharge or a

Unknown 20:17
lot of us that I better hurry up, huh.

Unknown 20:21
I think so, if you are interested. This is a benefit that is available, the tool isn't available necessarily but if this is something that you are interested in. He benefits. I don't know if I can wholeheartedly recommend it but he benefits is one way to go, and then actually pull me out the 20 1900, which is a very short form is another way to go. So, we can talk about that at the end. I get a very respond to the form. So, you've come to this point where it says, okay, you would select Yes, and you see the green button. What would you do next to get some sort of career counseling education benefits.

Unknown 21:04
Oh I hit the green button. Okay. Can

Unknown 21:07
you do that please.

Unknown 21:11
Now, because you had signed in on the other part of the prototype if you wouldn't mind go ahead and just hit sign in on this one, but excited to start your application so we'll flip over to that. Because if you were on va.gov, you would stay signed in, but model prototype would do that so this is what you would actually see

Unknown 21:32
on vocational rehab. Right.

Unknown 21:39
They don't have sale I'm not interested.

Unknown 21:47
You could put out a request for that.

Unknown 21:48
Well, a friend of mine did diving but they refused my sailing and I thought, you know. Okay. What's up with this.

Unknown 21:57
I don't know, maybe since you're in a forest they feel like you're infringing on the Navy's domain,

Unknown 22:02
well that could be.

Unknown 22:06
I don't know. So you've come to this, this page right here. But what would your next step be.

Unknown 22:12
I'm sorry, had the green button and apply if I you know if this was what I wanted to do, and since I'm here, I guess it is.

Unknown 22:23
Grab Ben, and click on the green button.

Unknown 22:30
No, this is a long way to actually get to the application, you know, we've clicked on the red button and the green button and

Unknown 22:43
I understand that and that is that is great feedback. You know how many spelling steps does it take to get to go, so we're definitely taking some of this into account as we go through your session and others, you know, we're going to take notes and make the changes that we need to to try to get this stuff a little more streamlined. So you click the green button. you've come to this point. And you are, Hector Delamere, what would your next step be,

Unknown 23:12
um,

Unknown 23:14
after I scream. I saw.

Unknown 23:19
Oh okay,

Unknown 23:21
Now,

Unknown 23:23
yeah, continue and, and

Unknown 23:29
the application.

Unknown 23:31
So assuming that's right, go ahead and do what you would normally do.

Unknown 23:49
So you're reviewing the information, and let's say there was, there was an issue you didn't really live on Elm Street you lived on maple

Unknown 23:59
and reviewing the screen, what would you do.

Unknown 24:02
Oh, let's see, does it let you modify it. Yeah. But to make all the selection to medical

Unknown 24:10
to work on that. Well, okay.

Unknown 24:35
And then looking at the screen in this scenario, this is the information that they have on file for you It looks good. What is your next step.

Unknown 24:43
Continue or confirm, I guess, from the email address. You can

Unknown 24:49
do that.

Unknown 25:08
And then you come to this screen. What are your thoughts here.

Unknown 25:14
Hello. Okay.

Unknown 25:31
See you. Yes, and moving in and changing addresses in the next 30 days.

Unknown 25:37
Are you planning on moving.

Unknown 25:40
Yes, I am.

Unknown 25:41
Really. Okay.

Unknown 25:44
But a winter home so I will be moving there for the winter I'm not selling this home, but

Unknown 25:52
closing and relocating next month.

Unknown 25:55
Wow, congratulations a winter home. Yes, please.

Unknown 26:00
Yes, help them had where I can sail the winter.

Unknown 26:04
I'd be amazing.

Unknown 26:05
Definitely. I would have so much time up here.

Unknown 26:11
That would be a real nice part of the country recovering, they're kind of famous for their sailing out that way.

Unknown 26:17
Yes, they've got one of the old America's Cup boats there too.

Unknown 26:22
They let me play with.

Unknown 26:25
Let you have the big toys. Yes,

Unknown 26:29
that is that is pretty amazing. I mean I couldn't sail. I couldn't roll the commode so anybody that you've had my respect. So, look at this. Is this what you would expect, you know, if you were moving and this popped up after you had guess.

Unknown 26:47
Oh yeah, sure.

Unknown 26:50
All right, we'll assume that you filled it out with your new address, you can actually do it we can take the time to do it but we'll just to certainly be completed that you put your address in, But next question I have for you regardless the box at the top. So it says, years of education, how would you determine that.

Unknown 27:12
Uh, I add them up I was just adding kind of formal education, you know, high school or college.

Unknown 27:22
You know, postgraduate degrees, all that kind of

Unknown 27:27
course like like training or anything like that. Okay,

Unknown 27:32
so formal education and going back to kindergarten is how you determine that. Yeah. Great. So, assuming you filled out your new address that you're moving to, what do you do next,

Unknown 27:44
and continue at the bottom. Okay.

Unknown 28:00
Oh, okay.

Unknown 28:03
Oh,

Unknown 28:05
say that because what are your thoughts

Unknown 28:08
here. Let's go out. I might say see anything I think, Oh my goodness.

Unknown 28:18
I'm also I like, you know, talking to people

Unknown 28:23
writing to people, east of, I don't know.

Unknown 28:25
Okay, so

Unknown 28:28
we're just looking at the screen. And, with that in mind, what would you do next.

Unknown 28:35
Well I'm really thrilled to see what it entails here. Yeah, I mean these electronically scheduling appointments and things are all right when they work but you know i i also don't get contacted back by somebody or they say they didn't get it, or they didn't see it or whatever. I'd rather pick up the phone and talk to somebody right then.

Unknown 29:03
So I'm hearing you say that the electronic steps Kempson seems like a barrier sometimes if

Unknown 29:08
you prefer to play often Yeah.

Unknown 29:11
Okay. So go ahead with that in mind, if you would just read what's there and make the decisions or make the choices that you would,

Unknown 29:43
I would try the tele counseling.

Unknown 29:48
What swayed your opinion and what did you read or see that made you say yes to that.

Unknown 29:53
Well see the other one is appointments sending documents your important stuff that it's got to work. And so I put no because it often does it felt like if it doesn't work. You can still pick up the phone.

Unknown 30:07
That's great, that is that is great feedback, appreciate you sharing that with us. Okay, so what would you do next.

Unknown 30:20
Yeah, I hate questions like this because every single day for me anyway is different. So, I can't say mornings are typically better but I can't say every morning is better.

Unknown 30:33
It's,

Unknown 30:36
you know, I would put morning and midday, but,

Unknown 30:41
you know, just depends on the day. Okay.

Unknown 30:46
So, knowing that your days are all different is, do you feel like Dude, this doesn't cover your, you know, your week. What would you prefer to see here,

Unknown 30:59
an actual calendar with time slots that are available and I can pick one.

Unknown 31:06
Okay that's good feedback too. So there's nothing here that would help you do that it's just check boxes. Right.

Unknown 31:13
I mean like with this meeting you sent me the list of available times and I picked the one that worked.

Unknown 31:19
Right. So some system that is kind of in line with those zoom account, would be alright so what would you do then having made this, this choice here mornings midday, knowing that they're not necessarily great and Seeing no other options. What would you do as

Unknown 31:38
well go ahead and continue.

Unknown 31:55
Okay. But the boss and continue.

Unknown 32:04
And having submitted your application and come to this page, or your thoughts here about what's going on.

Unknown 32:12
Well let's say that Oh wait, that's good. Yeah, I guess I just keep a copy for my records and wait to hear from them. And I don't call this 800 number.

Unknown 32:30
All right, so you feel like you have your, your next steps outline pretty good here. Mm hmm. Can I take you back, can you hit the back button on your browser. Okay. I wanted to stop on this screen right here, looking at, at this page. What do you feel the purpose of the gray boxes are.

Unknown 32:58
If you want to review, something if you aren't sure you answered something right or

Unknown 33:03
right. How would you do that, if you needed to review it.

Unknown 33:07
Well, hit the plus button

Unknown 33:13
set mine up with your expectations about what you'd say,

Unknown 33:18
Yes, sir.

Unknown 33:21
All right, well that pretty much takes us through the chapter 31 form. Having looked at the path to get here. You know the questions that we've asked, and the form itself. Do you have any general feedback for us about the process.

Unknown 33:40
Well the same feedback that there's a whole bunch of steps before you actually start filling out an application to talk to somebody. So you'd rather just dial a number and talk to somebody. Yes. Oh,

Unknown 33:57
put together a job if everybody

Unknown 34:03
will put that aside, you would rather have direct contact and communication with somebody.

Unknown 34:08
Well, we've been doing this now for what 3540 minutes and I still haven't talked to anybody is eventually filled out a form.

Unknown 34:17
So, you've submitted it. And looking at that. Go ahead. If you can go forward on your browser window, it'll take you to that confirmation screen. What do you expect will happen okay we spent 30 or 30 minutes when we fill out the form. What can you think will happen. Regarding this form if it were a real submission, you printed the page and now you're waiting. What do you think the next step would be.

Unknown 34:45
Well, presumably they're reviewing the application but in reality, probably nothing appears to be true, because I haven't tried to do this. So I don't know maybe they are very responsive.

Unknown 35:03
It's fair. I mean you you've had some experience with VA, some good, some bad. So, you know, whatever. Whatever your expectations are is kind of what we're trying to send around here. How do you expect that VA will get ahold of you that next point of contact. Sir anything on the screen here that lets you know, This is, this is when it's done.

Unknown 35:30
Well,

Unknown 35:33
I guess it tells you how you can check on the status yourself. Okay, if you haven't heard from anybody or if you're just curious, so I can see what what state it's in. Right.

Unknown 35:50
Okay, so you, you kind of feel like it's gone into a black hole because you haven't had a you know a person on the other end to say, Yes, we got it. We're good.

Unknown 36:00
Well, I mean, I'm always concerned it's gone into a black hole but again I can check on it here and if I don't see that it's even registered here. Um, but I would call them and.

Unknown 36:14
Or maybe they have it.

Unknown 36:16
So you could look to the you'd follow these directions here and then login and check your Claim Status. Yes,

Unknown 36:22
well I would imagine to once you submit the application that you would get an email saying that you've submitted an application. Okay. Most things like this, do send you an automated response that, you know, they've received your application.

Unknown 36:40
That's really good feedback. You are talking about a feature that we do have on our radar. So, that is, we've heard that from other people as well, that they want some sort of confirmation so I was just trying to figure out what Avenue, you would expect, VA to do to follow to get in touch with you about this. Okay. Well, that pretty much takes us to the end of this prototype. And if you don't have any other feedback in general or about this specifically, I think we can let you have the, you know, five more minutes of your time to go to noon but it looks like we fit it in all nicely.

Unknown 37:23
Okay, well I recommend if you send recommendations off I recommend they do this for the health care part, you know like, getting in touch with your doctor or ordering your medications and things because they have that process but that is a really laborious process. Okay.

Unknown 37:43
Who's that might help you that, that you're talking about there. Okay,

Unknown 37:47
yeah, Friday, my goodness, it's, it's

Unknown 37:50
very cumbersome and

Unknown 37:55
it's okay

Unknown 37:56
if what you're looking for is there then what what you need is to talk to somebody or get in contact with your doctor or the pharmacy. It's near

Unknown 38:05
impossible. Right.

Unknown 38:10
We can certainly put that in our findings and surface it and healthcare, often comes in on some of the things that we're doing, but we don't deal with my healthy bed directly, but we can certainly surface the issue, and I do know that there are teams that are working on these sorts of things to improve them and make them better. We're working specifically on the benefits but you know in some of the cross talk we can express your concerns. Okay, good. Well, I really appreciate you taking the time to go through this forum with us and give us your feedback. You have highlighted a lot of things that we had some concerns about. So we'll definitely take a closer look at those. And as we get through our sessions, you know, we're, we're finding more and more people are lining up with some of the issues that you've gotten so I do appreciate you sitting with us for the last 45 minutes.

Unknown 39:06
Well it was enjoyable. Thank you.

Unknown 39:09
Okay, well enjoy your day. Thank you very much.

Unknown 39:13
It was well. Bye bye.
