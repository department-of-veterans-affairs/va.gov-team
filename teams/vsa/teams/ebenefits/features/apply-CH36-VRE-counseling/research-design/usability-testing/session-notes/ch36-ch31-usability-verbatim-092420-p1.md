`Raw transcript/unedited`

Says extensively since leaving in 2018, the VA currently is my primary source for health care. I receive monthly disability compensation from the VA previously I have used the chapter 33 post 9/11 GI Bill benefits and currently I'm a student at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and that is being funded in part by chapter 31 vocational rehabilitation and employment benefit. 

S. Okay well you are a highly qualified candidate for what we're about to show you but what we'll have to do is kind of rewind the tape on you because you do have direct experience with chapter 31, we're gonna be starting out with chapter 36, okay so what I'm gonna say in the course of doing the prototype is we're we might play a little bit of let's pretend you know, we're walk you through the the prototype you know with your qualifications and we may say something like okay, let's pretend it's you know, you're six months out or let's pretend you know, it's been 12 years something like that will give you something to to kind of keep it going. 

Okay. That sounds really good and you've got a lot of recent experience too, so it's gonna be very valuable when you're taking a look at this if you don't mind I me asking when you did go through the process to to get those chapter 31 benefits 33 benefits, did you go through a BSO? 

I did not I both times I applied for chapter 33 benefits or both chapter 30 well third chapter 33 benefits. I applied through the VA's eBenefits site and then I suppose for the initial request for chapter 31 benefits. I completed that request through the eBenefits site and then the remainder of the process was completed. 

Between myself and an assigned VA counselor. Sounds good so you had a wrap help sounds like you did a lot of the work yourself to going to benefits yes that's good and it's recent experience too, so you're gonna you're gonna have a direct comparison here, all right what we're gonna be doing today are a couple of things the first thing is we'll look at VA.com and we'll look at the home page and let you hook around a little bit and get an idea of where you might look for this feature and then once we're through with that. 

I'll paste a link in the channel or in the chat here and we'll have you go to the prototype that we're testing and walk through that all right, so You're familiar with zoom and you you know how to screenshare correct? I do okay if you would please go to VA.com in your browser and then screen share okay, so. 

Let me. Just one moment. I think I had a new iteration of. Zoom, so I just need to make sure it's as saying that I need to change my preferences so I can share so let me just make sure I can do that. Sounds good. 

Let me try this again. 

There and there you go. Okay, perfect. Okay. All right. So now you're on Viacom in the homepage, you're familiar with this site, have you used to before? Yes, I have. Okay. All right. So looking at the or starting out with the homepage you you've heard that VA can provide some benefits for training accommodations finding a job that sort of thing. 

Where on this screen would you start looking? For that. If you were starting your search brand new From this screen, I would drip down to these headers down here and for anything as far as education employment training, my attention would be directed down here. About 36 chapter 36 benefits and you are familiar 31, you don't have to click on on anything that you think would take you to a page that would tell you about that. 

Okay. 

I would assume here that well, let me take a look. Sure. 

You know, my my props on a little bit biased knowing I'm being looked at my I would initially my eye would initially sort of drift here apply for education benefits, but if I scroll down further, I would be looking at education and training. Go ahead and click on that forest please it's it's hard not to be self-conscious when you've got people of your shoulder yeah right things differently here so I do appreciate that feedback so yeah and I understand how that goes been there too right okay, so you come to this page be education training benefits, what on this page will help you get to either chapter 36 primarily or even chapter 31. 

So going down here chapter 36 would be right here and it says chapter 36. As far as chapter 31, I would be I would be looking for two things when it comes to chapter 31 I would be looking for the you know, obviously chapter 31 just like how it says here but also you know what the program is titled the vocational rehabilitation and employment. 

So and into that end as I scroll through the site. I don't necessarily see that okay listed here there's a little bit of a gotcha in that well go ahead and have you click on that chapter 36, but VR is rebranded itself recently, so now it's better and readiness so you know exactly what to look for if you have changed the name so I think it's a case of. 

You knew a little bit too much but if you would please click on the educational and career counseling chapter 30, that was your inclination right yes, okay, yes. I just want to make sure and then looking at this do you see anything on this page or what would you do next if you wanted to apply for benefits? 

Um, You know, I go through this as far as reading the description, you know eligibility is a big thing right looking at the type of benefits I can get and then here would be a big one, you know, as far as you know, how do I how do I apply for benefits just you know, this this point here which is similar to chapter 31. 

That first there's an application and then that'll be working with the counselor. I know I think this is important to have in here it was very helpful for me when I was applying for chapter 31, but overall, you know, the the VA is a big machine and not necessarily a responsive one so knowing that it is certain point in the process, you know, you'll be. 

Either doing a portion of your application or finishing your application with an actual person like with an assigned counselor. I think for me that. 

You know that that was very encouraging to me rather, you know, you know before I had when I was applying for say chapter 33 post 911 GI Bill benefits, you know, you had to fill out these forms online and send it away but it's just kind of like sending it into a void and you didn't know who's going to review them you didn't know exactly when you were going to get it back there wasn't really a way to track the process you just kind of send it out and hope that you made it in time for your school deadline, so. 

A really big benefit to stating here that you'd be working with the human, you know, there's going to be a person on the receiving end so that that has some value to you yes yeah, okay yeah and and you know for what it's worth if there was a way to do like a a underline and pop-up here or some other description elsewhere of you know, exactly who a vocational rehabilitation counselor is and where they may be located, so for example the the initial count. 

Less or that I worked on with chapter 31 benefits was located in a town about 70 miles from me, but you know, I. You know that that told me that they were local so maybe like a basic description of you know, what a vocational rehabilitation counselor does, you know, what their role is how they help a veteran, you know how they're how a veteran is assigned to a counselor just something like that, you know, I'm always a fan of the more information the better okay, and that's really good feedback too because a lot of times we talk about the nuts of bolts of the program without getting into the you know, what is this actually look like it looks like sitting down with the human and You know, coming up with a career plan interacting with them and those sorts of things and so knowing that person's qualifications and their location and the fact that it's a person not avoid that you're sending it all that is that's good feedback out that's the sort of stuff that we can use to maybe tailor the content so that it's more meaningful to people like you who are going to be using this. 

Right yeah, you know that you know, especially with programs that deal with entitlements services and or you know, money monetary payouts, you know, the the department a government department like the VA, you know, it needs to have a very, you know, very ordered very structured. Bureaucracy and able to effectively manage that. 

But a lot of that is all behind the curtain from a veteran. So or you know, just someone in general for applying. So having a sense of you know, even just a synopsis or brief summary or something of how that process may work. I think can eliminate a lot of frustration as opposed to you know, just go ahead and apply and we'll get back to you well, you know, if you don't know if that's intended to be a day. 

Tube weeks is it is your case randomly assigned as a sinus specific person, you know. The more knowledge I think decreases the the element of frustration. Well we will see in just a minute if maybe we have addressed some of that. You see the green button that says go to eBenefits and you have recently done just that you've gone to eBenefits and you've applied for you know, some of the career counseling or the VRE chapter 31 benefits. 

So we're gonna stop here with VA.com and I pasted a link in the chat. If you could click on that, it will take you to a prototype of the new feature that we're working on. So we've brought that for me benefits over to VA.com. Sure and all just add in one final thing as far as trying to eliminate any ambiguity. 

Sure. I'm not you know, I'm not quite sure what the relationship is as far as eBenefits versus just VA.gov but I know in the past when it's come to certain certain information and processes for the VA. I have gone to eBenefits.com and it's told me to kick over to VA.com in order to conduct whatever I needed to have. 

In this case, it's sending me back to eBenefits. So I know you guys may not necessarily control which site handles what but right get just for your guys' situational awareness, you know, I getting kicked back and forth. I'm not quite sure you know, which ones to go to and which one isn't so just might be, you know food for thought as far as. 

You know how you want to manage between these sites and if there needs to be you know, some sort of information out there as far as what one site is intended for vice the other. Now, I can tell you from our perspective that you know, a lot of the features a lot of the self-service things are kind of split now because we're in the process of decommissioning you better migrating the things over. 

So in that interim in that time between getting it completely decommissioned we're moving things over and there is a lot of cross-pollination there. They're basically, VA properties than one's gonna be closed down in favor VA.gov's a front door. Not gotcha, okay. So that's that's our plan that's what we're working on here and so starting let's see you clicked on the prototype. 

Okay, so this is that partially working webpage that I told you about and this is what we are starting with in porting chapter 36 benefits. So if you would take a look at this. And find out what on this page is going to inform you as whether or not you are qualified for chapter 36, okay? 

All right, so pretty clearly up front it says right off the bat, you know, who is eligible for this and it's pretty simple to. Click through your chapter three one you already have some point benefits, all right, that's also pretty straightforward, although for this scenario. Just just pretend I'm not receiving this as if I'm just you can hold you can click yes or no, either either options viable well, okay. 

So you clicked yes since because you are actually receiving chapter 31 benefits and this pops up. What does this tell you? So that this essentially is telling me that I don't need to go through a separate application process and that both from before at the initial application screen how it talks about how it will put you in contact with the VRC this is well to me is just telling me that to look more into this program or to try and get the benefits from this program that I can just go straight to my assigned. 

Ational rehabilitation counselor, okay, so with your with your situation the way it is is this something that makes sense to you, does it give you a clear next step. To to me yes to me, this would just signify that my assigned counselor would have more information on this and from here on out. 

I wouldn't need to go any further in this process and that I could just simply email or call the person who I currently work with well that's that's really good information to you've got you know it inside and out but like you were talking about before for the purposes this scenario if you could just say no, I I do not I'm not receiving chapter one benefits sure okay, okay. 

For this we'll just say, okay. Have you or your sponsor been discharged? Last year sure. I'll say yes. 

Again, okay now having gone through this series of questions, are they clear do they make sense are we missing anything? 

Um, I think. This question here, are you using VBA education education benefits to go to school that could. 

Maybe just maybe just more specificity as far as what education benefits specifically if it was if this is intended to ask if you're using chapter 33 post 9/11, you know GI Bill it wouldn't hurt to to put that in just to eliminate any confusion, okay also. I'm not sure you know. 

How the answers change as far as this but. With the nature of this program is it different if a veteran is using say the GI Bill to go to school as compared to a military serviceman an active duty service member who is using the GI Bill but still planning on getting out and using other VA services. 

I think in general if you receiving. Any VA education benefits that they'd like to funnel you into chapter 36 benefits as well, you have a pretty wide net but I do take your point that maybe we can either offer some examples or be more specific if there are exclusions. 

Right yeah because I know I I used a portion of my GI bill actually quite a quite a decent worth my GE I built while I was still active duty as compared to using it again when I was separated from service and as a veteran okay well based on the answers that you've given it looks like you would qualify so what would your next step be to apply for chapter? 

36 benefits. What answering these questions. I would be inclined just to click on this button right here, okay, however for curiosity sake, you know, I would also want to just quickly check down on here. 

The. 

Questions. 

As as far as as far as this is concerned, you know, like this this might be kind of small. I'm not I'm not I'm not sure that this extra section here is necessary unless you've had feedback in the past from people that say I don't want to answer a handful of questions. 

I just want to go straight to it right but I would you know, I would kind of wonder. Because this says apply for career planning and guidance but this specifically says apply online with VA form, you know, 28-832 I would kind of wonder if this is gonna put me somewhere else than this okay, that's really good feedback, so there may be some confusion in your mind we can see these two on a screen which one you should click to go forward. 

Right exactly you know, so you know say say for example, I had spoken to a VA representative as I was in the process of separating from military service or you know, you just talked to the the expert which is you know, just another veteran who says, hey I'm in this program. 

I I think you're good for it you need to just apply for it, right? I would kind of you know, I might I might fit into this category of like well, you know, yeah, you know, so and so told, Me I do need this program and I need to do it but you know, I filled out these questions anyways. 

I would think kind of wonder like well okay is this gonna just put me to a different program than this okay that's that's a interesting distinction there too because the the scenario you're talking about is kind of what we're talking about, some people are told directly to go there and they identify it by form number versus okay at this point if you would just click whichever of these two links that you think would be more appropriate. 

With the scenario that you've got so we'll go to the next step sure all I'll just go ahead and this one. 

So now you come to this page and what do you see going on here? 

All right, so you know, I see that this is apply for personalized career planning and guidance. I equal to VA form 28 8832 education vocational counseling and application so so this is telling me that I'm gonna apply for some type of career planning and guidance and that this form is similar to 288832. 

Just a quick question as you know, just doing a quick perusal through. This form. 

I I'm curious to know why you know, if programs are are designated with specificity chapter 31 chapter 33 chapter 36, why not include that up here so that a you know, someone applying. Can kind of get the assurance that if they're on a mission to apply for chapter 36, they know at this stage in the process, that's still what they're applying for. 

Right nope that is good feedback too so just provide some sort of indicator that this is regardless of branding personalized career planning a guidance this is chapter 36 right yeah, you know again kind of going back to you know, not necessarily this this site or this this process in particular but you know, sometimes through the VA and or other sites, you know, sort of clicking along can kind of turn into choose your own adventure. 

And you may not know exactly where you wind up so again. I I would kind of initially look at this and say okay, I'm applying for this personalized career planning a guidance. I'm not completing this form you're gonna do something that's equal to it, but my friend told me I needed to fill out this form, you know, am I applying am I still applying for chapter 36 or have I been off ramped onto another program so if that's just kind of, My initial take if I can kind of put myself in the head space of someone who say is about to get out or it's just gotten out from his looking for some support so we need some continuity and consistency with the labeling to make sure that they know that they're staying on track instead of getting diverted into the wrong form, yes, yeah. 

I I would say that that would be very helpful and and really, I mean that could that could all you know, that could simply just be you know, putting somewhere up here, you know that the CH. 36 or 

Or you know, just label this by the official title or or something like that but yeah some some sort of assurance there yeah, all right we are actually just a little bit pastime do you have a little extra time in your schedule where you can walk through the form with us yes, okay. 

I appreciate that because I I've definitely got the time blocked out if you are available all right, so having looked at this and let's in a scenario where we've identified this and it is actually chapter 36. What would you do next if you to complete the form to try to get and apply for the benefits? 

I know I you know for for myself, um, Again, I would be inclined to. Sign in and start the application go ahead and click that okay? I know I know that you're situation is actually you're coming from the chapter 31 world so chapter 36 may even be redundant or an additional benefit. 

But having gone through that scenario. So you would sign in. Yes. Okay. And then go to apply for counseling. Okay. And because this is a prototype we are using just basically fake information. Sure. Yeah. All right, so coming in here, you know, if this is you know supposed to be me. 

I just review make sure that matches continue on. 

You know that that this is this big sense to me. I I actually was stationed overseas so I know that with a lot of online forms the format of overseas military addresses doesn't necessarily match what a lot of forms are so that would make sense that if I click there it would go to a different format. 

Okay. Otherwise. Just verify all this. That would make sense. You know, you know for here it would just be a simple if it didn't do that already copy and paste over so that verify the email when you click continue. If you noticed on here that something was wrong, maybe that you'll actually live on Maple Street instead of Elm Street. 

Sure, what would you do in that case? I honestly I I think in in this case, I would just manually change it and then continue on. It is it will accept that info. Okay. 

Now, I I wouldn't necessarily I don't know if we are dry if you're driving at something else. I wouldn't necessarily put two and two together that the VA has the wrong information on my overall file. Right and they probably well, I'll tell you from the perspective of putting the site together there are different sources for the address information and on a pre-fill we tend to pull it from that 360 and so it's not invaluable but it's probably going to be correct and so the information is provided, you know, as as a review sometimes it's not up to date people move right and sometimes they're errors, you know, but often the I would say probably the 80% cases. 

Oh, yeah, they didn't get. My address update. I moved. Right, okay. So for this. Fairly straightforward. 

And then. Conductor review here. I think this is actually pretty similar to the last time. I applied for chapter 3 3. Read the note, right? Click that. I'll be honest. I'm probably 95% of other people that if I have the if I see this I don't actually click that. 

To read it right well it's a that is my experience nobody has time or the bandwidth to try to consume the privacy policy, okay right you even though people have said you always got to read it you always got to read it, you know, it's always like well even if I read it and don't disagree. 

I can't get what I want without checking it, so. It's true and that is the case here, okay, so you've submitted the form and come to this so what would you do at this point having seen your your submission? One thing I would do in general is I I would print this page for my records. 

Usually what I try to do is I don't actually print it. I I have a printer at home. I know many people do not usually what I try to do is when printing this is actually have a pop-up screen so I can save as a PDF well to to that end. 

You know, because a lot of people do like to keep records but again don't like to either print it or don't want to waste the resources, you know printer is expensive having a button here where you either had the option to print it or download as a PDF download is a PDF would be very beneficial in my mind, okay? 

That is a feature you're talking about that we have cuz we are considering okay, we have a form system here on VA.com and it's evolving and we're trying to put new features and things in there so what you're talking about that's good feedback and that's good insight it is something I can tell you that is on our radar it's just something necessarily we can implement here yeah, but stay tuned we're we're constantly making improvements to the form system. 

Okay. Here. I will say. 

A thought I had would be. 

I don't know if this is feasible but like I said since in my experience vocational rehabilitation counselors tend to be geographically located. Um and assigned I don't know if it's feasible to do this but having the number to the local office where your applications are going to go to might be a nice feature. 

In my experience working with the VA over the last two years anytime I've been directed to or or not anytime essentially at this point now unless it's something very important if I'm directed to call a toll-free hotline. I'll just ignore it and not do it. Just experiences in the past of being on hold forever not talking to some or talking to someone who's not really qualified to address my issue. 

You know, calling up a hotline being told. I actually told the, Wrong hotline for my issue of being directed somewhere else. You know, it's just just kind of feels like you're just calling the Death Star and waiting for someone to pick up. No. Just wanted to throw that out there. 

No, I understand getting lost in the the phone trees and then redirected and terminal hold and callbacks of sorts of things. So what you would suggest or would you like to see in this situation is maybe we know who you are we know where you are maybe we can go ahead and provide information for the regional office versus the big. 

Switchboard. Right? Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Okay. No, that's good feedback. That's a that would be a good feature. I think a lot of value in that. Okay, so looking at this page, what would your next steps be if you'd come here to apply and you've gone through the application. Is there anything else that you do on VA dot gov you've talked about printing this this form or potentially downloading a PDF. 

Is there anything else that you see on this page that you might consider doing? The just taking note of this about how I can check this to out of my application that is good to know and again good to know that I will be able to get information about my application just through my account. 

Also down here as someone who does have service connected disabilities. I I also like this feature as well. Okay that it's not a it's not an all or none, you know, it's you know, you've applied for chapter 36, so let's just let this process pay out or play out. 

You know that there is other options there keying in on on what a veteran might need. You know because again going back to a lot of veterans here about these programs through word of mouth. If someone directed me towards chapter 36, I might not know to ask about chapter 31. 

I might not know what it is. The person who told me about chapter 36 might not know that chapter 31 exists. So having this here of. You know, letting me know that I might also be eligible for something else. I think this is very beneficial. The caveat I would put to that I would put forward with that is I think you could keep this with apply online for the VA form again if somebody feels that they already qualify forth but also maybe just an additional link here directing to the appropriate page where somebody could get more detailed information. 

Okay. So in addition to apply now like go there immediately something that would give them a little more backstory so that they can make the decision if this is appropriate. So more info or just go straight to the form. Yep, yeah, absolutely yeah the set a couple times already the more information the better or at least you know, having that information accessible because this, you know wallet good key in has a lot of process related verbiage, you know, so chapter 31 veteran readiness and employment. 

Benefits as I identified earlier a veteran also may not initially key in on this because they're used to their friends calling invoke rehab not both readiness. Also this integrated disability evaluation system. I'm not quite sure what that is. So I could be interested but just based off of this blurb fear. 

I may not have the information where I would have the confidence to want to apply. So, you know, having an additional link for more info, I think would be great. That sounds really good. Well, I really appreciate you taking the time and going into overtime with us on this. 

There was a lot of really good feedback and. Walking through the the form if you could just give us your general impressions of. What the experience was like performing. Yeah, absolutely. I you know, I'm overall I you know, I think that the the form is you know, fairly straightforward. 

You know, there's not really you know, there's never really any points whereas confused as to what the VA was asking for me or asking from me as far as providing information is well. I think it was made very clear that you know, one once this form is submitted that you know, it was going to be handled in a timely manner and especially you know looking in to. 

You know things like giving approximate time feedback multiple different ways to check in and just having applied for other VA benefits this kind of follows a similar sort of thing a very simple but effective way providing information online and especially from the alternative of having to print out a government form, you know, manually right in the, Information and then have to be able to scan and email that in or drop it as an attachment to another online process. 

Okay well I appreciate that too is there anything else that you'd like for us to know any other issues around the a.gov or need benefits. Yeah not necessarily things we've looked at but just in general just stuff you'd like for us to know before you you go. I yeah, I don't really think I don't think so, you know, I you know, other than what I was saying earlier about, you know, kind of the confusion between you know, what the what's the go-to site eBenefits or VA dot gov. 

I know you said you guys are already you know, Migrating everything over to one system is just a process yeah no other than that, you know, just in general chapter 31 was a very straightforward process for me to use obviously it was very successful for me because I used that right now and as far as managing my other benefits with healthcare and disability, I I don't really have any major complaints or issues with managing that online. 

That sounds really good. I appreciate you covering that for us so that's you've given us an extra 20-something minutes of your time, so I'll give you back the rest of your afternoon and I really appreciate you taking the time to talk to us yeah so anymore anytime and for what is worth? 

I really appreciate the work that you and your team does to keep improving the system and making it better accessible for veterans. We are happy to do it, you know, any anybody we can you know, if we make somebody's life easier, that's that's our mission. Absolutely okay, sir, all right, yeah appreciate if there's any follow-up questions feel free to reach out the email otherwise appreciate your time, thank you for the offer okay, take care.
