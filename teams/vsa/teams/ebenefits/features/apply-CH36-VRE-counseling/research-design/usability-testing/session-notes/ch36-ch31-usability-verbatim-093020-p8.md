Starting recording

Unknown 0:20
Okay, so do we have your permission to record this session?

Unknown 0:25
Yes.

Unknown 0:27
All right, thank you.

Unknown 0:30
To start out, if you would please just tell us a little bit about yourself, primarily your service experience, and maybe some experiences that you've had with VA or via tools progress.

Unknown 0:43
I, my Marine Corps veteran, Persian Gulf era. Have used some of the tools that VA has developed, mostly the my healthy bet.

Unknown 1:00
There was a couple other ones, I also I worked for the VA, so I have used on the other side.

Unknown 1:10
So I've been with VA for 14 years now. I have a background in it manufacturing and actually have cost accounting. So that's what I do. 

Unknown 1:24
Okay. Sounds like you've got two experts on both sides of the fence, and you probably know, quite a bit without overdoing your development process.

Unknown 1:33
Right. Great. Okay.

Unknown 1:37
So, you mentioned my Fitbit, have you gotten any benefits at all? Have you used? I

Unknown 1:44
looked at the benefits side, but I haven't actually used

Unknown 1:47
it. Okay, what about you?

Unknown 1:53
I'm sorry, say again?

Unknown 1:54
va.gov. Have you used that site? And if so, what for?

Unknown 1:58
i?

Unknown 1:59
Yes, I've used that. And I've done

Unknown 2:01
research

Unknown 2:02
on that. So looking for

Unknown 2:05
services

Unknown 2:06
or following up for a patient, as far as you know, where to get services where their closest facility is?

Unknown 2:14
Right. Okay. Have you? Do you have any experience with chapter 31? Or 36? benefits? Have you ever applied for those

Unknown 2:25
31? I think is the education.

Unknown 2:28
They're both education is

Unknown 2:29
their most educational offering.

Unknown 2:33
When I use my benefits for education, we didn't have the internet.

Unknown 2:41
Okay.

Unknown 2:44
Yeah, we haven't done we didn't use it was all paper. All right.

Unknown 2:53
Well, Chapter 3136 are their their education, training, career guidance, those sorts of things. So it sounds like you're familiar with them. But you didn't necessarily apply for them for duty.

Unknown 3:07
I did not apply now.

Unknown 3:10
The old GI Bill I applied for yet through the paper process, right? and utilize those and I used up what I had. So that can be really, really nice. Okay,

Unknown 3:25
so you have experience with GI Bill? Okay. Yes. All right, we're going to do two different things. Right there at the beginning, we're going to tell you share your screen and go to va.gov. And look at home screen. We'll talk a little bit about that. And after, I'm going to paste a link into the chat box in zoom. And clicking on that will take you to our prototype. So where are you comfortable sharing the screen with us? Yes,

Unknown 3:50
yes. Could you do that please? Sure.

Unknown 4:01
Alright, we'll go here. And then I need to be in a Google or EBM browser.

Unknown 4:08
Just know if you would please open a browser and then go to be a.gov.

Unknown 4:23
And let me shut my email down. That'll just be annoying as all get out.

Unknown 4:28
I looked the other way. was reading. Yeah, no worries. It's

Unknown 4:31
just gonna be it's gonna pop in. So let me screen okay. And there we are.

Unknown 4:42
Present, as you can see, down.

Unknown 4:47
Yes. All right. Thinking back to when you first separated from the service. And we're kind of kind of make a scenario here. If you just separated from service and you heard from somebody word of mouth here. Ready somewhere, they'd be offered career guidance, job training, those sorts of benefits, possibly some educational benefits looking@va.gov home screen, what would you do next?

Unknown 5:16
I would probably either searching, okay.

Unknown 5:21
And you can do that, whenever you're inclined to do that's sort of, you know, follow your nose and do what you do in that scenario.

Unknown 5:34
Okay, brings that to the top. Okay, then I would end up clicking on that. Good, okay.

Unknown 5:43
I'm gonna refine the scenario a little bit, you're looking for something where you can apply previous benefits. So you come this far, all you do next?

Unknown 5:56
Well, I can either read the page, or I tend to go faster, which is, you know, again, searching? Or?

Unknown 6:11
Okay, so there we are the 1990.

Unknown 6:20
Okay,

Unknown 6:21
so this is where I would sign up.

Unknown 6:28
The question I would have is, how would

Unknown 6:30
I know what benefits I will be eligible for before we get into the application part?

Unknown 6:38
That's actually very good feedback. And that's something that we have in mind, too, we're looking at a number of different things, but haven't come to this page. What do you feel is going on here, you can give us your thoughts on where you planted after your search.

Unknown 6:52
Okay, so this is the actual application.

Unknown 6:55
So I will be able to actually,

Unknown 6:58
um, don't include that, please. I don't choose

Unknown 7:05
not to grow.

Unknown 7:07
Um, so I would,

Unknown 7:11
I would probably start the application, but it's kind of weird, because you have the steps underneath where you

Unknown 7:18
could actually start apply.

Unknown 7:22
Right. Okay. So you feel that you're worthy of the steps below the starter button?

Unknown 7:28
Right. Okay.

Unknown 7:30
Good. That's good to be back down. Okay. Did you do have your I was thinking is top of mind, but you'd have both there as well. Awesome.

Unknown 7:40
Okay, I appreciate you going this way. Now is you know that the screen you identified it as being the the 1990, that you knew that it was a form. What I'm going to do at this point is I'm going to give you a link.

Unknown 7:55
Okay.

Unknown 7:58
And if you could click on that it should launch in your browser, continue to

Unknown 8:01
prototype. All right, let me see if I can get the guest for me.

Unknown 8:07
All right. So

Unknown 8:10
click on this link, please.

Unknown 8:30
So the scenario that we had to go through before you were just generally looking for Career Education, planning benefits and those sorts of things using the search, he got to the 1990. So that's chapter 33. What we've taken you to is another screen that in the course of doing a search for those sorts of benefits we're hoping to come to so this is the prototype, some of the things were some of the things don't necessarily, but what we're going to say in this particular scenario is that you think that you might qualify for chapter 36 benefits. So it's a little different from the GI Bill and chapter 33. But you know, generally that has to do with career guidance, job training, those sorts of things. So looking at the page that we've got here, we're doing a prototype, what would you do next?

Unknown 9:23
Okay, so apply for personalized career planning and guidance.

Unknown 9:28
Again, I would probably go down the form

Unknown 9:32
that I like this I like the questions that would take you to the right for

Unknown 9:39
a click veteran. Okay.

Unknown 9:42
Am I receiving chapter 31?

Unknown 9:45
this point in my Yes or no? Here?

Unknown 9:48
Yeah, I would say use your background. Excuse me to use your your current experience. If you've not received chapter 31 Press now.

Unknown 9:58
Hey, are using it

Unknown 10:01
I'm not currently using them, but I have used it. So you would

Unknown 10:04
put Yes.

Unknown 10:07
What would you be inclined to put there? With question, good question suited the way it is, what are your thoughts?

Unknown 10:14
I would say no, because I'm not currently using.

Unknown 10:19
Okay, that's a good distinction. So go ahead and do what you would you would do in a normal scenario.

Unknown 10:24
And I would probably put currently in here as well.

Unknown 10:27
Okay. Um, have you or your sponsor been discharged from active duty service in the last year? Or do you have less than six months after discharge now? Okay. So to be eligible, discharged in the last year, I six months until discharge. Okay.

Unknown 10:47
So I haven't gone through those questions. Do you feel satisfied that you qualify

Unknown 10:52
for the benefit here? Okay, so it's given the way I answered the questions. I don't. Okay.

Unknown 11:02
What would you like to see, in addition to this? Is there any other information we could provide that would make that that answer better for you?

Unknown 11:15
See, so she

Unknown 11:17
likes you and your sponsor must have been determined

Unknown 11:22
in the last year,

Unknown 11:26
or have lessons to constitute this charge?

Unknown 11:32
The phrasing the last year, can be construed as a calendar year. So I would say that the last 12 months.

Unknown 11:41
Very good. We've actually heard that, occasionally, that we need to be more specific with the timeframe. So I appreciate that feedback.

Unknown 11:48
Okay. And then if there's an option, I'm trying to think, I know, there are other resources and options I and I don't,

Unknown 12:00
I don't know the rules around VR II.

Unknown 12:05
But I would probably either link or put something else in there if you have the extra resources or another route you take for potentially getting assistance. Because it's kind of it's kind of cut and dry here. which I understand is you're going through the questions,

Unknown 12:24
you go into the tree, and this one says, yep,

Unknown 12:27
nope, you don't get it. Okay. Well, that's just gonna pardon me To be blunt, Israel.

Unknown 12:35
Oh, that's what we need to find out. I appreciate that.

Unknown 12:37
Yeah. Because it's, don't give me you're not

Unknown 12:40
giving me any other alternative. You're just saying no.

Unknown 12:43
So that what I did.

Unknown 12:44
Okay. That's very good feedback. So in with this scenario, with the page where it is right now, what would you do next? That would come to this one?

Unknown 12:54
Um,

Unknown 12:58
I don't know if I'd even go any further because it's like, okay, I don't qualify

Unknown 13:03
that, you know, what's the point?

Unknown 13:06
Gotcha. So you're like,

Unknown 13:08
yeah, I didn't stop. I probably should have paid down. Yeah.

Unknown 13:13
Alright, so for the purposes of just continuing, if you select Yes, and we'll just assume that you're within a year separation. Just at this point, assume that that time, right, and then follow the questions and tell us what to do next. Hey.

Unknown 13:31
Yes. Okay.

Unknown 13:35
Okay, so apply for career planning

Unknown 13:36
and guidance.

Unknown 13:38
ident appears but it's,

Unknown 13:40
it's a button but you're not telling me to click on it.

Unknown 13:43
Okay. Um,

Unknown 13:46
I mean, probably your your, your newer folks understand that that's a button but it's, it's, there's no Click here to apply.

Unknown 13:57
Do you want me to actually click on the button at this point?

Unknown 13:59
What would you do in in with your situation? And you know, there's a button would you be inclined to click it

Unknown 14:06
or would you go on somewhere? I'd be inclined to click it. Okay.

Unknown 14:17
Ready? So says,

Unknown 14:20
so back to the page we started on.

Unknown 14:26
Yeah, in Strictly speaking, this would all be happening on the same page. There'll be different states at the same page. Okay, with your it background, you know, what we'll be doing basically will be flipping components, but so the page will change to appear this way. Click

Unknown 14:48
Alright, so apply for personalized pre Planning Guide.

Unknown 14:52
Again, this is okay. I can just start it that's that.

Unknown 14:56
That's fine. But again, I don't have this

Unknown 14:58
step. So underneath it Feels weird. Okay.

Unknown 15:06
Here's what

Unknown 15:07
I'd like to be. So I think that's cool.

Unknown 15:13
Um,

Unknown 15:15
fly.

Unknown 15:18
See this career planning guidance form?

Unknown 15:27
Okay, so you're, you give me an option for help and a link, you given me apply complete this career planning guide is that I don't have a link or anything right here

Unknown 15:40
to go there.

Unknown 15:42
I know we have at the top of the bottom, but it feels weird,

Unknown 15:46
because it tells me to click this form, but I've got nothing to click on right here. Okay.

Unknown 15:53
All right, you're looking for something actionable right next to the instruction. So if that's what we're telling you, you're looking for a link

Unknown 16:00
somewhere. That's pretty much what I'm,

Unknown 16:03
yes, we have it here and you have it above, but I got nothing here.

Unknown 16:10
That's good to be back to you, thank you.

Unknown 16:15
Do you have sort of expected disability maybe also, you may also be eligible for chapter 31, veteran benefits.

Unknown 16:30
benefits if you have

Unknown 16:33
IE ability

Unknown 16:45
is processed you should.

Unknown 16:50
Um, the layout of this paragraph is not to get into the weeds, the layout of the paragraphs weird, because I have the goal here.

Unknown 17:00
I would probably

Unknown 17:02
either break that paragraph a lot, because it says you also may be eligible. And then it just, it just feels like the way you do it the way you have the rest of the page laid out. It feels like this should be bulleted. Okay.

Unknown 17:19
So you want smaller bite sized chunks, right? kind of step by step through it. Right? Yeah, that's that this is also the sort of thing that we need to pay special attention to the language. So I appreciate you giving us feedback on that. So having read that, What's your feeling about how you should proceed? What would you do next? Okay, so

Unknown 17:39
you should that says complete

Unknown 17:41
this one first, which for you got to

Unknown 17:46
hear, but

Unknown 17:48
you know, complete this form, you need to, again, you're telling me to do something? Where is my ability to do the action. And then it says put the link at the end of this form to also apply?

Unknown 18:02
Which means that I filling out two separate forms.

Unknown 18:08
So that seems ambiguous, too. It does.

Unknown 18:11
Okay, and completing this form first, which I'm not sure which format is now

Unknown 18:16
is the end of the instructions.

Unknown 18:18
And then it says clicking the link at the end

Unknown 18:21
also apply.

Unknown 18:23
And then you have the link to the form there for vre. Right.

Unknown 18:29
Okay, so having written that, and it sounds like we've introduced some confusion in there, but in the course translated out, what would your next step be?

Unknown 18:42
Um,

Unknown 18:43
okay, so it says complete this form First, I will go directly here. But that's probably not the right form that I need to include

Unknown 18:51
completing. Because?

Unknown 18:54
Because that's the closest link I've got from the instruction. Right.

Unknown 19:03
Okay. It does make sense that you would click there because it is so close. Right? Your reasoning there. But you say that you feel like that might not be right. So if you were looking for some sort of certainty, what would you do?

Unknown 19:20
I probably go, I would go down and start with Yep, start this application. But again, this is the way they're labeled. It's pretty ambiguous. I mean, start my application while you're telling me I have to fill out two or three different forms. What am I filling out here now.

Unknown 19:42
As you go down the page.

Unknown 19:46
You are definitely uncovering a lot of what we have concerns about. So I really appreciate this line and your information same with this summer.

Unknown 19:56
So if you if you were inclined to do this

Unknown 20:00
You can go ahead and do that discoverable, it'll take us to the next step. If there is anything else you would do on this page, what would that be?

Unknown 20:07
Um,

Unknown 20:15
okay, so now you're telling me I can get help.

Unknown 20:19
Um, and I understand why you put the bottom because you want folks to be able to do their own thing first, before burdening the helpdesk. Um, but I would put this at the top. Because the folks that are going to apply to the benefits and to the

Unknown 20:39
RV are highly

Unknown 20:40
likely to have a disability that they're not going to be able to get.

Unknown 20:44
Okay, that's really good insight, too. And you've you've been on both sides, you've worked for VA, and you as well. So you know that pretty well. Okay, that is going to be that. Okay, well, at this point, having gone through the page have looked at, do click report, do what you would expect you to do if this were a real live application or trying to get to that.

Unknown 21:10
Okay, so I would initially do the signing and start your application, you can do

Unknown 21:15
that. And it will not to do with something and it will just skip straight for up to two assignments date.

Unknown 21:23
Okay, so.

Unknown 21:26
Okay. So the question I would have is, I'm signing in to start my application, now you have a starting without start my application outlining is there an account I have to create.

Unknown 21:40
Um, if you go to va.gov, and you want to get to some of the tools, you have to login, go to sign in. And depending on the tool, you may have set up certain levels of authentication. So the sign in here will would take you to that screen that we saw, when you clicked on it nba.gov designer, it'll take you to a place where it's going to have three different signing options. Okay, but because this is a prototype, we skip that, we'll put you through it.

Unknown 22:10
But if you were to sign in,

Unknown 22:13
and we're live, it would take you that screen, and you can go through that authentication, and then come through to the authenticator the next state on this page.

Unknown 22:24
Okay,

Unknown 22:26
that's not,

Unknown 22:27
I mean, give me two options. But it's not indicated here that I have to go through what I'm saying, understand what I'm saying. Okay, so there's nothing here to indicate to me that I'm going to have to either create an account or go through the dedication process,

Unknown 22:43
which you know, I could start it with,

Unknown 22:45
this might be my better option, and I

Unknown 22:47
don't have a lot of patience stuff done.

Unknown 22:50
But it's not clear. Okay.

Unknown 22:53
Did you have a

Unknown 22:55
DS logon? Might be talking about my healthy dad, you've got that?

Unknown 22:59
Yeah, I did it mean.

Unknown 23:02
So you, you have one of the three routes that we have that can get you there. So if you could sign it, would you? Or would you choose to print it?

Unknown 23:22
I don't mean to complicate your scenario.

Unknown 23:25
But if I can just the scenario we started with was I heard from somebody that there's education benefits available. Now I'm assuming I don't have any the dedication, any of that information already set up. So my inclination would be to start the application without signing in.

Unknown 23:47
Okay, in that scenario, because what you would follow, and that's a live link. So if you click that, you'll see what happens next. So I appreciate you giving us some clarification on your thought with that too, because you do have the login, but you're following the scenario. And so we're, we're we're going to follow that, you know, as it was just part of it. So

Unknown 24:09
you come to the screen, what do you do next?

Unknown 24:12
I will put in the information that's required. Okay.

Unknown 24:18
So you don't want me to do that? You

Unknown 24:20
can you can make up names. Mickey Mouse or Bart Simpson.

Unknown 24:24
Gotcha.

Unknown 24:26
Yeah. It's not going to submit some of this information will will go anywhere.

Unknown 24:31
Gotcha.

Unknown 24:34
suffix, no SSN can be Um, okay, so you're asking me for my social security number,

Unknown 24:47
and not on a secure site? I'm not,

Unknown 24:58
yeah, I'm not logging to secure area.

Unknown 25:00
So I, it looks like I'm just putting my Social Security into a site that may or may not be.

Unknown 25:08
Okay. I would,

Unknown 25:11
you know, more or wait to it, I noticed the identifier that VA uses, but it can be a little ugly.

Unknown 25:22
folks who are a little hesitant to do that.

Unknown 25:27
It's good to point out, because if there can be a barrier for somebody using it, and that's the sort of thing we're not necessarily testing here, because we do a performance system when it's the sort of thing for you to do the circus kind of bring it up to say we're in acute state, we're asking for secure information. What assurances can we offer? So that's good, thank you.

Unknown 25:51
Anything with that? Not so much the birth date and the social security number is

Unknown 25:55
is is?

Unknown 25:58
Yeah,

Unknown 26:00
you have to click the box. The icon actually is not live.

Unknown 26:03
There we go.

Unknown 26:04
But that would be in prototype.

Unknown 26:10
Okay, and

Unknown 26:12
continue? Yes. That's where

Unknown 26:23
I live my United States military bases. Okay, no,

Unknown 26:29
I would

Unknown 26:30
change this phrasing to click here if you live because

Unknown 26:33
it doesn't tell me

Unknown 26:37
not to write

Unknown 26:41
us

Unknown 27:04
have a tea say this.

Unknown 27:08
That's great. We're just not

Unknown 27:09
happy.

Unknown 27:12
This is also personnel because

Unknown 27:16
No, not really. Not Not at all. But thank you.

Unknown 27:19
Can you don't even have my state listed? Killing me? Alright, so then I'm gonna have to be creative. All right. Yeah.

Unknown 27:29
postal code.

Unknown 27:34
Phone number required.

Unknown 27:37
Okay.

Unknown 27:43
email address.

Unknown 27:47
And I gonna have to remember this, or is this just a,

Unknown 27:51
you know, this could be? We don't know, any field so you can put anything you want in there? Just fine. We'll proceed.

Unknown 28:20
Okay, so the veteran.

Unknown 28:30
Okay. I don't know. Okay. So your auto saving the application? I guess this is more of a technical question. You're honestly having the application. So how are you identifying

Unknown 28:43
who I am? If I didn't sign in?

Unknown 28:48
I think it's their their developers online brokerage, but give you an explanation. But I think it saved your session storage.

Unknown 28:57
Okay, so it's like, based on the IP on

Unknown 28:59
the Yeah, gotcha. All right. Sorry, guys. Um, the application later, I will probably put it at the top as well.

Unknown 29:12
Because if I get here, like, Oh,

Unknown 29:14
you know, I gotta, I gotta go and then I

Unknown 29:16
pull down to the screen and

Unknown 29:18
notice that this is here.

Unknown 29:21
Alright, so

Unknown 29:25
we'll continue

Unknown 29:29
playing that info.

Unknown 29:34
Okay, so how would I know I know I'm supposed to open this up. But how would I know? Well,

Unknown 29:43
so how did you know? I mean, you you have a background in it. I know.

Unknown 29:49
The problem.

Unknown 29:51
They're not not everyone's gonna have that. But you had an idea when you came to this screen. Print. Your first reaction was like oh, now

Unknown 30:00
Yeah, my first reaction is okay, what information?

Unknown 30:03
Are you? Are you asking me to do

Unknown 30:04
something here?

Unknown 30:06
What options Did you give me? Because if I didn't know to click this, I'm like, Okay, I have accepted that privacy problem, private privacy policy.

Unknown 30:20
And then I will hit submit.

Unknown 30:24
So this doesn't indicate

Unknown 30:26
that I can edit anything here.

Unknown 30:30
Even though I put them a thing, it says I can write.

Unknown 30:38
So you feel like it's kind of new. It's kind of obscured? Is that what I'm hearing? Yeah.

Unknown 30:46
I mean, it's not clear. It's not clear to me that this is if I mess something up on the previous page, or if I wanted to do for my information, which might be another option here in the statement, you know, it's grown click information, click on the plus to expand. And then you have the option to edit.

Unknown 31:08
And then,

Unknown 31:09
again, this is required

Unknown 31:11
to read the privacy policy, which means that all right, so if I click on the link to review the piles, yeah, sorry. I clicked on it, to review the policy. Right? Well, this checkbox and automatically we will adjust it

Unknown 31:32
not in the live site. For the prototype in the live site, you would pull up the policy, so you would be able to take a look at. Okay. But on all the time, we don't just like we skip the the logic, we skip some of the other things too. Right. So your inclination? If you're probably the person so far, who clicked on?

Unknown 31:57
Would you do you typically do that? Look at the privacy policies?

Unknown 32:01
Well, that's required, I have to open it up to at least that's okay.

Unknown 32:11
So if you had to, you would just do what you had to do to get through the form. Typically, do you look at privacy policies now? But that's kind of in line with most of us. So that's what do you want?

Unknown 32:29
Yeah, right. Yeah, it looks like I do, like, you know, you look for Microsoft. Yeah, no, just click on that to move on. Right. But if you're gonna make this required, I would separate it, I will put the pot price and policy,

Unknown 32:47
probably

Unknown 32:50
somewhere else above it, and then give you the option to either check it here or if you're going to leave it, open it,

Unknown 32:56
put it on the

Unknown 32:57
screen that's open.

Unknown 33:00
You can hear me saying, you know, put the required on the thing that's actually required. Don't make it look like it's the privacy policy. If it's not required, was that okay? Nope, that makes perfect sense. So what would you do at this point, having open the accordion looked at the info spent the next three hours watching or reading privacy policy?

Unknown 33:25
Okay, so I go back, I'm gonna check the box.

Unknown 33:30
And then I would probably submit because I finished okay.

Unknown 33:35
Patient bar

Unknown 33:43
thank you for submitting

Unknown 33:47
the date that was submitted.

Unknown 33:51
And for the purpose of the prototype we did have we were capturing the name so we've got a placeholder in there ready

Unknown 34:02
to print this page for your records is nice.

Unknown 34:06
But if I give you my email address, why couldn't you send a

Unknown 34:09
confirmation by email address?

Unknown 34:13
Very good feedback.

Unknown 34:18
Because I would I would print but if I had option to just confirm electronic copy my email, that'd be awesome.

Unknown 34:27
Okay, would you be inclined to do both print and receive an electronic? Yes.

Unknown 34:36
I have I think I know what you need printed but

Unknown 34:40
what what would you use the printed page for?

Unknown 34:47
So some of us still believe in paper. Okay.

Unknown 34:52
So part of my as part of my file

Unknown 34:58
electronically Still

Unknown 35:00
printed copy from Iran.

Unknown 35:04
That makes perfect sense. And you've got kind of a backup

Unknown 35:09
papers. redundancy.

Unknown 35:12
Okay. That's good enough. And again, that's that's in line with quite a bit of what we hear. So you are not alone. Okay. So what would your next step be? First off? What do you what do you expect is going to happen? Now the meaning of this based on what you see here? Okay, your next steps would be alright,

Unknown 35:35
so Okay, I

Unknown 35:36
applied print this page for your records, I had that

Unknown 35:39
choice,

Unknown 35:43
then you tell me how long it would take to

Unknown 35:46
process

Unknown 35:53
on this set of statements?

Unknown 35:56
Probably separate these two.

Unknown 36:00
Again, smaller chunks,

Unknown 36:02
then they please don't replay again. We've made that bigger. Okay. Well, why? Because we apply. Yeah, we hadn't heard anything, we're going to assume that. Okay, somebody's throat. Right.

Unknown 36:22
That's going to mean something to you. So in that scenario, you feel like most people, would you that other people would just continue to apply until something happened. Right?

Unknown 36:35
Now you give me the how long it will take? And then you're telling me how to check the status.

Unknown 36:44
I would flip those.

Unknown 36:48
Okay. Can you give me 123 of the trade details after? Is that? Okay?

Unknown 36:55
Because I can check the status at any point time.

Unknown 36:57
So if you're going to have the checkmark status, then I don't have

Unknown 37:00
to worry about waiting on some coffee. I can just do it.

Unknown 37:06
That sounds good, too. I appreciate that.

Unknown 37:09
And that this is kind of this statement here is kind of redundant, because it may take some time to appear on the homepage. But you're telling me up here, it's going to take

Unknown 37:19
me a week here or something?

Unknown 37:24
You know, I right? Feels inconsistent. I think I understand where you're going with

Unknown 37:30
that. We're giving you two different timeframes for different things.

Unknown 37:33
Right.

Unknown 37:34
So my assumption is I submitted by application, okay, 2448 hours, you should be

Unknown 37:41
on the homepage.

Unknown 37:43
And then you're telling me a week to decision time.

Unknown 37:48
Just feels weird.

Unknown 37:51
I mean, my application shouldn't appear or

Unknown 37:57
my actual

Unknown 37:57
application shouldn't appear until a decision has been made. But when you check on the status, you could check on it with this just a message versus the complete application for the decision. Does that make sense?

Unknown 38:14
Yes.

Unknown 38:17
So what would your next step be having come to the end of this page in the concert submission? What would you do with this?

Unknown 38:25
Okay, so

Unknown 38:34
questions I

Unknown 38:35
like this

Unknown 38:40
is also by

Unknown 38:46
little creepy.

Unknown 38:58
I would go to here, not polite for the vre. But this doesn't make sense to be here. If you're going to do applications that why would I roll into it right here?

Unknown 39:13
expect the link to be higher? Yeah, I would expect that you can read this page. I'm

Unknown 39:19
done with this particular application. Now I You can tell me all right, you're eligible for vre in the next step

Unknown 39:25
in the process?

Unknown 39:28
Because those will run ideally concurrently? And then talk about the 123. And then how long does it take? And then what am i More questions? That's better order for better flow. Okay,

Unknown 39:45
no, I really appreciate that I can I understand your thinking behind them. So thank you for sharing that with us. It seems like you want to keep the you're done and the action things up the top. So you can just roll right into them. And then put the information names at the bottom saying console. Given one is that, is that right? Okay. Perfect. Thank you. All right. Well, that is pretty much all we have to show on that on the chapter 36. One. So I really appreciate you walking through this witness, just in general, looking at the the questions that we got, that we haven't had to be getting up and getting them into form. And so if you have any general thoughts that you want to share with us,
