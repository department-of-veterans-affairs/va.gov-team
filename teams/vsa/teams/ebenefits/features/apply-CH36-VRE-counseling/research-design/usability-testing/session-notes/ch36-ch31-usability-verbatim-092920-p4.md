class. All right, there is no case where the session, so that we can take notes.

Unknown 0:13
Yes, thank you.

Unknown 0:17
We are going to bypass that first thing that I was talking about. We're not going to go to va.gov. What I'm going to do is I'm going to put a link in the chat box to the prototype, we're working on. Okay. So if you can find the chair,

Unknown 0:37
probably has somebody see now.

Unknown 0:43
I'm really late.

Unknown 0:46
And there you go. If you click on that.

Unknown 0:54
Okay.

Unknown 0:58
I'm sorry. Did I use

Unknown 1:05
whatever your favorite browser is is

Unknown 1:07
fine. Okay. Yeah. Chrome this one we tend to use here. But Anything is fine. And then once you have that screen up if you could please share your screen, through zoom, do not do that. All right. Yes. All right.

Unknown 1:34
Okay. any work okay there we go finish here.

Unknown 1:50
Okay.

Unknown 1:52
Okay. Can you see

Unknown 1:54
beautiful. Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

Unknown 1:56
Okay, everybody must know okay.

Unknown 1:59
I am still, it's a little shaky but I think we can work. So you're closer to the microphone I can hear you. All right, this is the prototype that I was talking about so it's not really working the screen, but it's clickable. So there are things that you can do so because this is a usability test of this prototype, we're going to give you some days to do in some scenarios. Okay. The way we'll start out is, if you've heard that VA offered, job training or benefits, having to do with education or Educational Counseling and you came to this page. What would you do here to find out if you were eligible. Um,

Unknown 2:46
I guess I was

Unknown 2:54
alright. Those are this questions aren't clickable. So, you can go to those and answer them as if you were here.

Unknown 3:05
Okay.

Unknown 3:20
So you've answered them, because of your own personal history, you've applied yourself to this, having come to this box. What does this mean to you. Okay. What would you expect what happened if you weren't eligible, is there anything that you would like to see different from just a boxing, you're not eligible.

Unknown 3:48
Maybe.

Unknown 3:54
Perfect. That's great feedback. Okay.

Unknown 3:59
So you went through a series of questions pretty quickly. What was your impression of them were they easy straightforward. What did you think of the questions as you're moving through. Oh yeah.

Unknown 4:28
All right, we're going to pretend now,

Unknown 4:30
instead of answering no on that last question. We're gonna find that you're within a year of discharge, and just click Yes, and then continue and you were, you know, a year out.

Unknown 4:42
Okay.

Unknown 4:47
Well, you were very quickly click that green button.

Unknown 4:52
So what was your thought about that whole process of the question. Do we. Right.

Unknown 5:07
Oh, move forward. Right.

Unknown 5:20
So maybe if there was something that I needed.

Unknown 5:24
I think it highlighted, or maybe even

Unknown 5:28
before. Right.

Unknown 5:32
That is very good. If not.

Unknown 5:37
Okay, that makes perfect sense. And we see, we see that sort of thing happened a lot in the session so. Sounds like what we need to do is kind of bring the important stuff up so you see it, and maybe give it to you before we get you into the questions, so that you know look at it way. Okay. All right, well, having hit the green button and you come to this point right here, and you see the gray box. Where do you. Where do you think you are now in sight. Okay.

Unknown 6:19
Okay. Well, great.

Unknown 6:22
As it turns out, you are pretty much on that you're on the intro for the form. So we haven't gotten to this point, and determine your eligibility with the questions. What's your next step now if you wanted to apply for benefits.

Unknown 6:36
Um,

Unknown 6:39
I should, scroll down and see what else you said no and

Unknown 6:47
or sign and

Unknown 6:50
I appreciate you sharing that with us, you know, I appreciate you taking the time to look at it now. He put it there. But I do appreciate the answer because you're not alone. You're not the only person that does just that sort of thing. So I'm going to do what you would do that. If you came to this screen, it should be clickable. You click Sign In. If I can just break for a second. Would you consider not signing in, to fill out the form, why would you click Sign In.

Unknown 7:33
Okay, very good. As it turns out, that is the case. So now the screen is switched over, this is actually the same screen, but it switched over now this is what's your next step.

Unknown 7:51
I mean I do see that applied for career counseling So,

Unknown 7:56
um, unless you know what I went through here. If not, I will just probably be trying to click on the form, where we showed you before.

Unknown 8:11
Well, whatever your first impression or your first inclination would be. Can you go ahead and have

Unknown 8:19
what you would normally do if you just want to do this one.

Unknown 8:32
So now I can come to this screen. What do you think is happening here.

Unknown 8:49
I'm here back.

Unknown 8:53
Okay. Let me put this again.

Unknown 8:56
Okay. I believe that you can click the back button. So that is something

Unknown 9:01
duck.

Unknown 9:06
Bingo. Actually you're absolutely right. I should have done that I designed that. Thank you. Yes, okay. If it were alive you could actually put the Back button, but you're right, it opened up in a new window. Okay, so you're saying that you would have you felt that you would have gotten there and Aronson would click on the button and this one.

Unknown 9:26
Yes, I would.

Unknown 9:33
Now, this is not a real site so we're saying the purpose of this feasibility test of your Hector talebearer. Okay.

Unknown 9:43
So what do you think is happening on the screen.

Unknown 9:47
So I think it's okay.

Unknown 9:55
You okay please do. Yes.

Unknown 10:07
For example, if you want to do a free feel. And then I'll just go down there now is the need to continue. And of course I

Unknown 10:20
can't stop for just a second what if, what if you notice, if you notice that there was an error here, like let's say you lived on Maple Street and on Elm Street. What would you do, and then how can you go ahead and do that that is if it were, you know, real world was saying,

Unknown 10:40
Okay, these people

Unknown 10:44
really have.

Unknown 10:50
That's the only change

Unknown 10:53
in a scenario where you just noticed that the street was wrong.

Unknown 10:56
Okay. All right,

Unknown 11:03
now. Okay.

Unknown 11:18
Now I have one more question before you go.

Unknown 11:23
So you made a change. You have an address and information Speedo for you was mostly right there was a change. What do you expect is going to have that once you hit continue with that address change.

Unknown 11:35
That should go into the form. I don't think I should have to answer this question again. Okay. Um. To me, it should get me into the form. Okay.

Unknown 11:48
So now you come to this, and you feel like this is redundant. Yeah. Okay. What would you do, seeing the screen like this What's your next step.

Unknown 12:02
I mean, I will see

Unknown 12:13
if the screen didn't let you go any further, if you had to make a choice overdue choice the screen.

Unknown 12:21
Oh,

Unknown 12:25
okay. Well, please do that and let's see what happens.

Unknown 12:32
Okay you. Yes.

Unknown 12:35
That's what we will do

Unknown 12:53
before you hit submit. I have a question you. You knew to click that, plus button, and then it shows and so is that what you expected. What were you expecting when you click that, that gray box and plus. Well,

Unknown 13:17

Unknown 13:45
And then usually here

Unknown 13:49

Unknown 13:58
You You seem to know this system pretty well. I really like the idea that you take a picture of it with your phone. Can you tell me why you would. I mean, I know it's easier to have it on the phone. But why, why is it important to take a picture of it, or print it out. How do you do it. Why would you go to that set

Unknown 14:21
was not expecting the

Unknown 14:25
phone comes to kids.

Unknown 14:28
So how would you know because.

Unknown 14:40
Perfect. Okay, well I really appreciate that insight too. And that is that that is something that we've heard from other veterans, you're not alone that we're working hard to make the performance better. And every time somebody tells us something like that, it's, it's more evidence that we need to make these confirmation screens kind of bulletproof and make sure that these things get through. So, we appreciate.

Unknown 15:10
Okay. Yeah. You knew that

Unknown 15:15
there were you could go to a Claims Review screen Is that your personal experience or did you see anything on the screen that that told you about that. No.

Unknown 15:28
What do you see on the screen that tells you what the next steps are.

Unknown 15:44
Again a page

Unknown 15:54
where you are looking for, you know, anything that is not. Okay.

Unknown 16:03

Unknown 16:13

All we're pretty much at time. So I think we're able to get just about everything in there, and I really appreciate you hanging in there with you know technical difficulties and my inability to hear. I've got this recorded, so I'm going to record it back and forth and pull a lot of your feedback out. A lot of what you're saying is in line with kind of Aaron's impressions. And I think you've also got some unique insights to in taking pictures is pretty genius. That's, I think that's a great idea. And to know why you worked so well thank you very much. Is there anything else that you would like for us to know outside for anything about VA in general,

Unknown 17:37
something you'd like to say before we go,

Okay, that's good. That is definitely the goal of what we're doing with with migraine you know on paper forms and getting things off on all the different types of

Unknown 18:35
understandings individually use your phone for for forms.

Unknown 18:41
I'm sorry. Say it again.
