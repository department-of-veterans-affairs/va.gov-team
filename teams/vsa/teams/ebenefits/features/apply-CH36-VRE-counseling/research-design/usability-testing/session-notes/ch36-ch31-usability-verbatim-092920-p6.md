Alrighty. The way we're gonna do this is we're gonna have two phases. We're gonna have. We're gonna show you b.gov, have you shared your screen. Talk a little bit about how you might get to this new tool that we're working on, and then I'll give you a link in the channel. And we'll go over to the prototype oh look at that. Okay, first if you can just tell us a little bit about yourself, maybe your service experience or some experiences with bn.

Unknown 0:40
m. I am a disabled veteran. I served in the Army for four years. I served in Vietnam and artillery unit. So my earring is, is really sure. I'm wearing headphones until I can hear it better. I am I, you utilize the services of the VA here in Loma Linda, California. and I'm a little familiar with some of the Career Education counseling that we

Unknown 1:17
put

Unknown 1:18
my benefit to the head,

Unknown 1:22
and present time, I am a legal assistant in a law firm. Okay, this one.

Unknown 1:36
So you've heard of chapter 39 in chapter, 36. Okay. So you mentioned that you do have some benefits. va.gov, have you gone to that site for anything.

Unknown 1:57
Yes, I have

Unknown 2:02

Unknown 2:06
claim that are my have filed or things of that nature. It's a very interesting website.

Unknown 2:13
Okay, thank you. We're working to make it better.

Unknown 2:18
And this, what we're going to be showing you today is the prototype is very much like your car but it's not actually part of the site, but what we're going to start with is homepage. So could you share your screen with us.

Unknown 2:31
Absolutely.

Unknown 2:44
Okay, I just want

Unknown 2:47
to talk.

Unknown 3:05
Okay, we see it.

Unknown 3:09
I don't want to, you know,

Unknown 3:11
you don't see me, I see you're

Unknown 3:12
calling me john black It's okay.

Unknown 3:17
it's gonna take me probably can't see you on video, I can just see your screen, and that won't capture so that's alright.

Unknown 3:28
If you could go to view.gov.

Unknown 3:34
On this on a separate essay.

Unknown 3:37
That would be better if you want to do it that way, on a separate tab. I don't think there'd be any harm. If you use this screen but let's be safe. There you go.

Unknown 4:04
No, yeah. Remember the screen.

Unknown 4:07
Okay.

Unknown 4:08
Okay. So this is the va.gov home screen, and see chapter 36 benefits. If you would heard. Well, you took advantage of these benefits at some point. So you did hear that VA does offer career counseling and job training, and a few other educational benefits. Where would you try to find that if you were investigating it for the first time, where would you love.

Unknown 4:38
I'd go to education and apply for education benefits or compare GI Bill benefits. You can go to the

Unknown 4:51
Education for

Unknown 4:53
All right, would you click on the thing that you think will take you to what we're talking about.

Unknown 5:00
Absolutely I would click on. First of all I can apply for education benefits. Okay.

Unknown 5:10
Yeah, please click on that if you would please.

Unknown 5:19
Okay, how to apply, or

Unknown 5:23
if he had billing related.

Unknown 5:27
Okay.

Unknown 5:31
And giving me information how to prepare before starting my application. To find out if you're eligible for VA education benefits, which helps. She would benefit you get to guess. I'm pretty familiar with this.

Unknown 5:52
Okay. If you see something on the screen that you think will take you to what we're talking about career counseling would you click on that, please.

Unknown 6:05
Okay, here's some

Unknown 6:11
educational and career counseling.

Unknown 6:18
Okay.

Unknown 6:27
Okay, this is a page that I wouldn't go to, because you don't want to try to play around with these websites. If you don't know actually where you're going. And that a website takes me, as opposed to retaking it if you understand what I mean. So I will learn more employment benefits. There's. It explains to me.

Unknown 7:02
Okay.

Unknown 7:03
Some of the qualifications.

Unknown 7:06
So looking at what is there you see the qualifications, or the eligibility. in the box. Do you take you to a place where you actually apply the standards.

Unknown 7:26
I would, but

Unknown 7:36
she says employment benefits for dependents but that's not what we want is power the, how do I get the benefits. I could go to eat benefits to apply what we want to. So we want to follow the rules applied for us here, flying into your benefits account to like apply their readiness, education and career counseling right there. Okay.

Unknown 8:19
All right, feel about the path that got you here do you feel like this, this was a good way to get to the place where you apply, what are your thoughts on it. Until now,

Unknown 8:31
I'd be nice if they can find out if you have to go through the steps

Unknown 8:40
there.

Unknown 8:44
They're reasonable steps.

Unknown 8:49
And then,

Unknown 8:51
take this to apply for education career counseling, which is the part where you fill in the information that's requested.

Unknown 9:02
So you feel like this is pretty clear.

Unknown 9:06
What you need to do. Okay, that's great for me.

Unknown 9:09
Yes, I'm sorry for me that's pretty clear.

Unknown 9:14

Unknown 22:40
You have a chat box open,

Unknown 22:43
and you read off the link. Do you remember what you did to get back to that can you click on to zoom in and find that chat and open it up.

Unknown 22:56
Well, the only problem is the

Unknown 23:02
drop down box is covering up. I think that zoom.

Unknown 23:13
You have something on your screen that's kind of that might be hiding the controls.

Unknown 23:17
Well, it's, it's the it's the issue drop down box to mute start video participants. You share in IoT remote control yours, your screen sharing and an extra pain. Okay. And then

Unknown 23:38
I might give you a keyboard shortcut. All right.

Unknown 32:41
An email.

Unknown 32:46
I think it's a bug but I do,

Unknown 32:49
maybe a reason.

Unknown 32:53
So, I heard you sort of grow a little bit and you said you don't really like this confirm email question really

Unknown 33:06
is not so much easier I don't necessarily like it. Many places. I mean many that go out so it's not necessary.

Unknown 33:19
Imagine it done for

Unknown 33:24
the A, it wouldn't take if it was different anyways.

Unknown 33:29
Right. All right, we'll go with that. Okay.

Unknown 33:34
If I would have put the bottle in and type in my email address incorrectly, it would have accepted this. So, maybe you're correct. All right, you're edited content.

Unknown 33:48
Whatever you do Next please.

Unknown 33:51
And I do have another question for you. Are you using a mouse we're using the keyboard to navigate through the page.

Unknown 34:02
The keyboard. Okay. Okay now I'm just using my pad.

Unknown 34:08
Okay. Gotcha. Okay.

Unknown 34:20
While it's doing a lot of

Unknown 34:22
fun. It is

Unknown 34:29
good for somebody. Yes or no. All right,

Unknown 34:38
Here we go. claim an affirmation. So,

Unknown 34:50
information now, I shouldn't have the plus doesn't doesn't open up anything

Unknown 34:56
on green click on it and we'll see if this lines up with your expectations.

Unknown 35:03
Oh, we actually, actually. Okay. Oh is reading the information back to me.

Unknown 35:12
Well, that's cool. Okay.

Unknown 35:18
So when you fill out forms online. How do you normally handle reviewing the information and make sure it's fine.

Unknown 35:30
Well,

Unknown 35:34
if it's not read back to me. Towards the end of this application.

Unknown 35:41
I will go with what I put in, I

Unknown 35:48
just trust that you put it in writing.

Unknown 35:51
Correct. Okay. But then, if you put it in the front that sounds a lot better. Sounds like something that you probably keep because it's a,

Unknown 36:05
it's at least correcting it in the beginning.

Unknown 36:10
All right, submit the application.

Unknown 36:15
Yes sir you have come to the end of the application. So, having done that, and turn the box. What would you do next, hit the submit button.

Unknown 36:26
I have read and submit and accept the privacy code and then out quick after looking at the app to make sure everything is correct and I would click Submit. Submit.

Unknown 36:39
Okay well please do so.

Unknown 36:46
Okay, thank you for submitting your application that date submitted credit for your records. After this question, check on the status. Okay, now it's asking me CVM service connected disability

Unknown 37:13
rating ready enough unemployed. Okay. Ready.

Unknown 37:24
So what are you thinking haven't read that, that.

Unknown 37:29
So quite often that might be, I might want to look at because

Unknown 37:36
I have to see what it is you know what it's all about.

Unknown 37:41
Was it being

Unknown 37:43
issued also.

Unknown 37:46
If you have a service. Okay, I will learn something today Okay,

Unknown 37:52
that sounds good. So, having come to this confirmation page, and you've read through the standard. What do you think the next steps are going to be for you. What do you think the next steps might be for the VA.

Unknown 38:06
For me, I would print a copy of this from my records

Unknown 38:15
data submitted and everything, and it answers a bunch of questions. I think I finish. Okay.

Unknown 38:25
answers questions. Sure.

Unknown 38:31
I can redo the whole page and everything. Yeah, we're finished.

Unknown 38:37
We pretty much finished right on time. That was pretty much the entire form that we step through. So we've come to the point where I asked you what your general impressions were of the form of questions that are being asked at the beginning and then the form itself. What do you think about this as a form.

Unknown 38:56
Well, first of all I really think it was, it was very easy to fill out the form for benefits. Okay, I definitely can confirm all the information, and I think most of the bits can follow this information because it's not too wordy. It's enough to read, so that you can follow and veterans are not

Unknown 39:29
what I say. They're not.

Unknown 39:33
They like to keep things simple, they like to use a kiss method. And that's what I see here. And I think it's not complicated, it's easy to handle. And I think you guys have really improved.

Unknown 39:48
Well thank you, I appreciate that. All right, well we're pretty much at time then, and I really appreciate you, bearing with us all the technical difficulties that we run into. And I'll say it out So Rob to this one Julian. So,
