# Topline summary for usability testing for Chapters 31 and 36
**VSA eBenefits Team | September/October 2020**

## Goals
We conducted usability testing to determine if the new forms and wizards are intuitive and functional for users needing to submit either form VA 28-1900 or 28-8832. This is a high-level summary of initial observations, but not the final analysis.

**The goals of this document are to:**

- Ensure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
- Gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data

## Participants and testing sessions

We held seven sessions beginning September 24; the last scheduled call was October 1. Seven of eight participants attended, and sessions typically went 45 minutes.

## Guiding questions

### Where and how (what links/navigation) do participants expect to find CH31 and CH36 forms?
Participants went to the VA.gov home and were asked, "If you heard VA could help with finding a job or getting training, where would you look on the site?"

- Users were drawn to the white quadrants
- They tended to look in the Education box
- Several users mentioned they'd use the search feature, two did
- Only two users scrolled the page to the featured benefits links

### Do participants understand the function of the wizard features?
Users were given a link to the CH36 wizard and asked, "Please take a look at this page and see if you qualify for Chapter 36 or other benefits."

- Some users were thrown-off by the varying references to the programs and forms (e.g. Personalized Career Planning and Guidance, CH36, 21-8832)
- However, all users went fairly quickly to the wizard and started answering questions; no prompting was needed
- Most users felt they qualified for CH36 benefits using the scenario given them (that they were within a year of leaving the service)
- The users who went to the CH31 wizard all qualified on their own merits
- Many users found the language around timeframe ("the past year") ambiguous and wanted clarification/specifics
- When the wizard question led to a "stop," users understood they did not qualify; several wanted links to alternate resources or information

### Will users identify the differences between the CH31 and CH36 programs and select the right form(s)?
Three users navigated to the CH31 wizard. They were asked, "Why were you were sent here?", "How is this different from the previous page/screen/form?", and  "Please look at this page and see if you qualify."

- The VA program "branding," PCPG and VR&E, was lost on participants; CH36 and CH31 were more meaningful to some users
- A few users noticed the link(s) to the CH31 wizard (on the CH36 intro and confirmation screens); they generally confused this link with CH36 when seeing it on the intro screen, but understood it was another program when they saw the same link on the confirmation screen
- No user encountered the CH31 link/crossover within the wizard
- Jumping from one wizard/form to the next seemed to disorient participants who clicked there, though two did understand they were taken to another page
- The other user was irritated to "have to do everything over again," but continued on to successfully determine eligibility and complete the form, not knowing he completed the CH31 form

### What challenges prevent users from quickly and accurately completing the forms?
No participants actually qualified for CH36 benefits since all were too far removed from their separation dates. At that point in the wizard they were told, "Seems you don't qualify according to our questions; but what if you were within a year of separation?"

- Users easily navigated through the 28-8832 (CH36) 
- All participants who went to the 21-1900 (CH31) were all confused by the "years of education" question and wanted clarification
- Participants paused on the he communication options screen; all users answered reading only the questions themselves
- Users generally felt both forms were "straight-forward" and easy to complete

## Hypotheses

### Users will have some difficulty locating the landing pages/logins for the CH31 and CH36 forms on VA.gov
Not entirely. Participants tended to find CH36 and CH31 content pages via the Chapter 33 screens. Generally, users believed career guidance and job readiness were part of the CH33 GI Bill.

### Users will generally understand the function of the screening wizards, but will miss the "bypass" link
This was confirmed: only one user saw the link and recognized it went straight to the form.

### The language in the wizards and intro will confuse users; they may misunderstand when they can apply for both CH36 and CH31 benefits.
This did seem to be the case, only one participant clearly understood there were two wizards and forms. Generally, users proceeded with the CH36 wizard and form not seeing that they might also be eligible for CH31 benefits. A few noticed the CH31 section on the confirmation screen and expressed interest in applying.

### The forms themselves will be very easy for users to complete
This proved true. Once the users made it into the two forms, they proceeded quickly and easily to submission. Participants were generally satisfied with the confirmation page, though some users wanted a different presentation or more details.

## Other notes
- Many participants found the inconsistency in terminology about the two programs confusing; i.e. they were shown Chapter 36, 21-8832 and Personalized Career Planning and Guidance at various points, with Chapter 31 terminology mixed-in as well
- Only one person noticed the "skip to form" link(s)
- All but one participant opted to "sign-in" to proceed
- A few users felt to intro screen copy wasn't informative enough
- Some users wanted shorter, better defined "bullet points" to outline the process 
- Users were uniformly tripped-up by language around timeframes; e.g. the "have you been discharged in the last year" question in the wizard; users wanted to know if this meant 2019 or within the last 12 months
- Users who were asked to make an address change expected (but were not hopeful) that the change would populate all VA systems
- Several users wanted email confoirmation that their forms were submitted
