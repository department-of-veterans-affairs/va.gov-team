# Topline summary for usability testing for Chapters 31 and 36
**VSA eBenefits Team | September/October 2020**

### Goals
We conducted usability testing to determine if the new forms and wizards are intuitive and functional for users needing to submit either form VA 28-1900 or 28-8832. This is a high-level summary of initial observations, but not the final analysis.

**The goals of this document are to:**

- Ensure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
- Gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data

### Participants and testing sessions

We held seven sessions beginning September 24; the last scheduled call was October 1. Seven of eight participants attended, and sessions typically went 45 minutes.

### Guiding questions

#### Where and how (what links/navigation) do participants expect to find CH31 and CH36 forms?
Participants went to the VA.gov home and were asked, "If you heard VA could help with finding a job or getting training, where would you look on the site?"

- Users were drawn to the white quadrants
- They tended to look in the Education box
- Several users mentioned they'd use the search feature, two did
- Only two users scrolled the page to the featured benefits links

#### Do participants understand the function of the wizard features?
Users were given a link to the CH36 wizard and asked, "Please take a look at this page and see if you qualify for Chapter 36 or other benefits."

- All users immediately began answering the questions in the wizard; no prompting was needed
- Most users felt they qualified for CH36 benefits using the scenario given them
- Only one person noticed the "skip to form" link
- Many users found the lanuage around timeframe ("the past year") ambiguous and wanted clarification
- When the wizard question led to a "stop," users understood they did not qualify; several wanted links to alternate resources or information

#### Will users identify the differences between the CH31 and CH36 programs and select the right form(s)?

#### What challenges prevent users from quickly and accurately completing the forms?

### Hypotheses

#### Users will have some difficulty locating the landing pages/logins for the CH31 and CH36 forms on VA.gov
Not entirely. Participants tended to find CH36 and CH31 content pages via the Chapter 33 screens. Generally, users believed career guidance and job readiness were part of the CH33 GI Bill.

#### User will generally understand the function of the screening wizards, but will miss the "bypass" link

#### The language in the wizards and intro will confuse users; they may misunderstand when they can apply for both CH36 and CH31 benefits.

#### The forms themselves will be very easy for users to complete
