# Topline summary for usability testing for Chapters 31 and 36
**VSA eBenefits Team | September/October 2020**

### Goals
We conducted usability testing to determine if the new forms and wizards are intuitive and functional for users needing to submit either form VA 28-1900 or 28-8832. This is a high-level summary of initial observations, but not the final analysis.

**The goals of this document are to:**

- Ensure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
- Gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data

### Guiding questions

#### Where and how (what links/navigation) do participants expect to find CH31 and CH36 forms?
Participants went to the VA.gov home and were asked, "If you heard VA could help with finding a job or getting training, where would you look on the site?"

- Users were drawn to the white quadrants
- They tended to look in the Education box
- Several users mentioned they'd use the search feature, two did
- Only two users scrolled the page to the featured benefits links

#### Do participants understand the function of the wizard features?

#### Will users identify the differences between the CH31 and CH36 programs and select the right form(s)?

#### What challenges prevent users from quickly and accurately completing the forms?

### Hypotheses

#### Users will have some difficulty locating the landing pages/logins for the CH31 and CH36 forms on VA.gov

#### User will generally understand the function of the screening wizards, but will miss the "bypass" link

#### The language in the wizards and intro will confuse users; they may misunderstand when they can apply for both CH36 and CH31 benefits.

#### The forms themselves will be very easy for users to complete

### Participants and testing sessions

We held seven sessions beginning September 24; the last scheduled call was October 1. Seven of eight participants attended, and sessions typically went 45 minutes.
