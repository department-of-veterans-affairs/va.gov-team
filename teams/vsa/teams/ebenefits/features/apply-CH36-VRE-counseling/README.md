# Executive Summary

## Abstract

Veterans and related claimants can apply for "Chapter 36" benefits, or Education and Career Counseling benefits, through the TED (Transition and Economic Development) Office. This is a very simple application for which we should attempt to prefill all possible fields.

## User Problem Statement

eBenefits, in its current legacy state, is no longer the best version of what can be provided to Veterans, their dependents and caregivers, so that they can quickly and easily apply and obtain the benefits they deserve.

## Solution Goals

### User Goals

- **Veterans:** Apply for Education/ Career Counseling at the VA.

### Business Goals

- Deprecate eBenefits, meet TED office goals of better online submissions

## Assumptions

- Product will submit form to Central Mail, no other BE integration
- LOA3 users may be able to apply with one click

## Requirements and Constraints

- Application should be available for all users: UNAUTH, LOA1, and LOA3
- Excerpt from systems requirement doc: In response to the receipt of a 28-1900 - The system will display and check the following: Veteran or IDES (yes/no), service connected disability rating percentages and conditions (if 10% or more continue eligibility check); discharge other than dishonorable (continue eligibility check); served on or after September 16th 1940 (if yes to all four, Veteran is eligible to participate in an evaluation for chapter 31).

## Solution Approach

- Translate form to VA.gov, prefill logged in user info, submit to Central Mail. Current EBN functionality involves clicking a single button. 

## Value Propositions

### User Value

I can apply for CH36 benefits quickly and without mailing in a form or visiting a RO.

### Business Value

1. Sunset EBN
2. Increase CH36 applications

### KPIs-OKRs
#### KPIs
- Discoverability
- Number of online submissions

## Go-to-Market
_How will Veterans find this product? How will they know it exists?_

- Comms isn't controlled by this team but discoverability may be a lever to pull
- Perhaps at account log-in/creation
