# Personalized Career Planning and Guidance (CH36)
`Jason Wolf, Product | December 2020`

**00:04** This video is for Personalized Career Planning and Guidance, a product guide for the Contact Center. The intent of this form is to present an eligibility wizard and then have the Veteran walk through a form and provide contact information. Let’s get started.

**00:25** Here’s the form eligibility wizard. We’re going to start by selecting ”Veteran” and going through some of these questions until we get presented with the form itself, which is right here.

**00:41** We’re now presented with the login screen where you can either sign in to start your application authenticated—where your information would be pre-filled for you—but today we’re going to simply go through as if we were unauthenticated so any user on VA.gov can use this.

**01:03** Fill in some info.

**01:18** Then we’ll select one of the options below in the event that someone selects  spouse or child of a Veteran or service member, they would be asked to put that service member or Veteran’s information in as well, so we’ll show an example of that. The sponsoring Veteran or service number goes here.

**01:43** We’ll go back though just for the simplicity of this video. And then here you can see we’re simply provided providing a review and confirm screen where you can go back and see all the entries, edit them as needed, and then continue with the form. And this is what it shows when you have a successful submission.

**02:06** You can also print this page.

**02:11** This feature is going to be found in the Careers and Employment hub under the Career Planning and Guidance section.

**02:24** And that’s it, thank you very much.
