### Background

Usability testing of the new Certificate of Eligibility (COE) feature/design included wayfinding . Most participants expected to find their COE for VA-backed home loans in the "Download VA benefit letters" feature. The documentation quadrant on the VA.gov home page has a direct link to that tool. The benefits letters feature is not in active development.

The feature currently has a series of accordions that contain download link for various VA-issued documents. There is a link to the COE feature on eBenefits below these accordions.

There may need to be a "Download your COE" accordion and link in-line with the other download-accordions.

### Users

Judging from the documents themselves, Downloand Benefits Letters users are primarily Veterans. Users must authenticate to view the download page.

### Flow
There is a direct link from the "Records" white quadrant on the VA.gov homepage. There is an intermediate landing page [(Download VA benefit letters)](https://staging.va.gov/records/download-va-letters/) providing info and instructions, and prompting users to sign-in. The next screen asks for an address correction/confirmation before allowing the user to continue to the downloadable documents. 

**User flow:** Home >> Download VA benefit letters >> Sign-in >> VA letters and documents (address check) >> VA letters and documents
