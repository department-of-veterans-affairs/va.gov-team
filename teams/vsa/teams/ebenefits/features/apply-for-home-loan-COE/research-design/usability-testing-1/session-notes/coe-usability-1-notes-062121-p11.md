## Warm-up
 - Please tell us a little bit about yourself. Maybe start with your service experience: Well, I was for 6 years in the Navy, deployed to Iraq in 2006-2007. Um, that's about it. I was medically reitred in 09. We bought our house in 2012. I did use the VA home loan, so. 
 - And you anticipated my question. How did that go for you? Okay, fine. Um, I don't really remember how. I think I just called someone and they mailed it to me.
 - (If "yes"): No, I don't remember any snags or problems with it. I do remember having to get that. Um, that's about it.

## Wayfinding
User screenshares / 5 minutes
- You heard there was a way on VA.gov to apply for a COE, where would you look for that? I would sign in first. Let's see if there's anything else (user scrolls up and down page quickly, clicks sign in in header, sign in with My HealtheVet ID).
- I'm curious, why would you sign in?: Well, because (signs in with IDme) it would have my personal information and everything to it already there, ya know?
- Next: probably the records (went right to records quad) It's not in education, health care, nor disability. (clicks on Download VA benefit letters... there is someone with him, can hear whispered conversation telling him where to click)
- Where would you expect to find it on this screen?: scroll it down some and look under the get records. Let's see what it has to say. (scrolls up and down some, then clicks on "Learn how to apply for a home loan COE" in side nav)
- Can you find somewhere on this page that would take you to a COE tool?: (scrolls up, Clicks on Eligibility in side nav) The eligibility requirements, I would probably then go for How to Apply. (Clicks on that) I'm not really seeing anything that jumps out at me. Oh, there. (hovers over go to eBenefits to apply button)

## Usability tasks
- So you've come to this page; What do you feel is going on here?: I see all the "How to apply" then "how to prepare before starting my application". I would be under the Veteran tab. But I don't really need any of that. I just want to go straight to the, uh, get the form. 
- Do you see something on this page that will talke you straight to the form? (scrolls up and down) Apply for a Certificate of Eligibility
- Go ahead and click on that. And that takes you here. What do you see happening here?: (starts reading alert box header) I see that I would have to resign in again to another system. And you know stuff like that.
- Is there anything else on this page that you see that is helpful for getting you through this process: Uh, (scrolls down) That's about it.
- You scrolled down, did you see anything that was relevant?: The burden of time, 15 minutes, (chuckles) glad to see that it's not long. 
- What would your next step be?: I guess to sign in. 

### Task 1 / Automatic COE scenario / 5 minutes
 - User selected sign in that needs more information

### Task 2 / Missing info scenario / 5 minutes
 - Having come to this, what do you see happening?: Okay, so needs more information before um before it can be done. (reads prefill note) I guess Apply for a COE, right?
 - So now you've come to this screen. Do you have thoughts about what is happeing here? I would scan over and make sure everything is correct, then press continue.

### Task 3 / Complete 26-1880 / 10 minutes
 - Let's say in this case, you are actually Hector D'Olivera, Jr. What would your next step be? Try to add that on there. (Clicks on suffix arrows, adds Jr.), Continue
 - And so what are you thinking now?: Just making sure my address is still the same. You know. (continue)
 - (scrolls down on next page) What do you see happening here?: I see the phone number and the email address. I would have to reconfirm the eamil address or copy it from above and paste it down there. (tries to copy and paste, then just types, then continue)
 - Having come to this screen, what do you see happening here: the service history, I would select that I am a Veteran or whatever the appropriate selection is and then press continue.
 - And this is the next screen what are you thinking here: I'm thinking that the start date, end date, everything is correct. (continue)
 - And now you've come to this. For our scenario, you had a loan that you paid off.: Alright, I would say Yes, I have had a loan in the past and then continue
 - So what are you thiking about this screen? I would determine what am I using this COE for - am I using it to cash out refinance, restoration of eligibility, or yeah.
 - For the scenario we were talking about, which do you think is the best?: Just buy a new house (selects "A restoration of entitlement")
 - Is there anything that we can do to make this more informative: Nothing really, I guess for each tab it's a different part of the form that needs to be filled out. You know, it's been awhile since I've had to use this form. (presses continue)
 - (reads screen, fills in loan information), I don't know the loand number, I still own the property, then I mean I wonder why they would ask if I want to refinance the loan. If I've already paid it off, why would I want to refinance it. And it was just a previous question that asked me did I want to refinance.
 - So you would select no because you feel it doesn't apply?: Yes.
 - So now you've come to this screen. What do you see happening here?: Adding a copy of my dd214, evidence that the loan was paid off, and uploading those 2 documents. 
 - What would you do next? We'll just say that you have this information available?: Why would you need a copy of my 214. It's already knows my dates of active duty service from 03 to 2020. Is my thought there. 
 - So your thought is that the VA has that info so why do you need to provide that?: yes
 - With that in mind, what would you do next?: I would upload the 214 and the loan document (selects item from drop list, clicks upload a document, selects VA home loan documents from drop down, clicks upload another document)
 - What do you see happening here?: I see those 2 documents ready to be sent over, press continue? (presses continue)
 - What do you see happening on this screen?: I see a lot of tabs, applicant information, contact information and so on. I guess I would check to see that the information is correct one more time. (opens and closes applicant info accordian)
 - You took a look at the one tab and confirmed that the information was correct. What would you do now? Yes, Click this (the privacy policy checkbox) and press submit
 - So now you've come here.: (reads confirm alert box, scrolls down) I see when will I hear back, within 5 days and that's it. 
 - So what do you think the next steps for VA would be. How would they contact you?: I would expect they'd send me the form in the mail.
 - Okay, and when would you expect that?: 5 days
 - Let's say you wanted to find out before then what the status is, like on day 4 what would you do? I would probably call the 800 number that you use for everything else. 800827800 or something like that. I've had to use it a few times to check on my disabiliyt compensation.
 - What would your next steps be?: That's it.

### Final thoughts
 - Having gone through the form, is there anything we can clear up?: I don't know. On this page alone, I would proabably just cut off the Request for Certificate of Eligibility because you already have that up here, which would move up the date that you should expect it in the mail.
 - So you're saying move up, that would put that information higher on the page? Yes.
 - (goes back to accordian page) If you could have a thing that said, instead of the drop down arrows here, you would just have a quick view of everything. you know. Instead of each tab being you know, have a generated view of the form or something. you have block 1 Hector as your last name, so on 
 - So instead of having the information hidden in the accoridans, if we just presented you with the completed form you could see it all at once?: Yes, something like that. Maybe not have it as an accoridan type pull down tabs.
 - Next, I didn't see... why did you need my 214. I've already given it to the VA 14 times. Let me go track it down again. It's not one that I keep on me all the time.
 - So you're expectation is that the VA already has my dd-214, please don't ask me for it agian? Yes.
 - Why do you think that the VA is asking for it again? Because the systems don't talk to each other. Like the compensation doesn't talk to let's say the GI bills section or something like that. You'd kinda think that they would.
 - Is there anything else about the form itself that we could improve?: I can't think of anything else.

### Wrap-up
 - How do you feel about thtis process?: because of the 214, I may call them to get them to send it to me in the mail or fax or whatever they do instead.
 - Having to subimt the 214 online would be a stopping point for you? Yes, because I don't usually keep it on hand like that.

### Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
