## Research Goals 
The goal of this usability study is to assess how easily participants locate and apply for a Certificate of Eligibility in a VA.gov-based tool/form, including:
- Where do users expect to find the COE tool?
- How do users feel about the “automatic COE” feature?
- What do users expect regarding future availability of their COE?
- What barriers prevent users from easily applying for a COE?
- Where does confusing language prevent users from understanding the form?
- What other features or content would help users when they apply for a COE?

## Research Methodology 

We conducted moderated task-based user research sessions via Zoom June 14-21, 2021. Each session was approximately 45 minutes long and consisted of a few warm up questions, a wayfinding task on va.gov, and three tasks within a UXPin prototype. This allowed us to explore veteran expectations and understanding of the COE process and usability of the form.

Our hypotheses were:
- Users will initially look for a direct link in the whit quadrant on the home page; many will locate COE landing page after several steps
- The form itself will be relatively easy for users to navigate
- Biographical, contact and service language will be clear to most users; the language around loan options and COE intent will be somewhat confusing
- Users will expect their COE to be available in various ways: physical letter, email, printed, and/or within an authenticated profile/dashboard
- Users will ask for directly available information (chat, direct phone, lookups) about the COE, lenders and /or realtors

### Research Questions

- Where do users expect to find the COE tool?
- How do users feel about the “automatic COE” feature?
- What do users expect regarding future availability of their COE?
- What barriers prevent users from easily applying for a COE?
- Where does confusing language prevent users from understanding the form?
- What other features or content would help users when they apply for a COE?

## Key Findings
1. Participants expected to be able to access the COE feature through the “Records” white quad on the va.gov homepage.
2. The sign-in widget distracted users from reviewing intro screen content.
3. Participants accepted the auto COE presentation and functionality.
4. It was not clear to all users that they needed to “apply” to make changes.
5. Loan intent and document upload panels slowed users down.
6. Participants had varying ideas of where they’d find their COE when complete.


## Details of Findings
1. When asked where they would go to apply for a Certificate of Eligibility, the most frequently used location was the “download your benefit letters” link in the “ Records” quadrant. Two users found the COE landing page and two participants saw the COE links at the bottom of the letters screen. It seems participants connected the COE, which is a benefit document, with other benefits and expected they would be together on VA.gov.
2. All five participants signed-in before seeing the subway map or reading the automatic COE content. One user did scroll to the bottom of the page, but only noted the estimated time to complete as useful after the moderator asked if there was any information on the screen that was useful. There was no indication that the user read any of the other content.
3. All users understood that they had “received” or “found” their COE, even if they didn’t understand that they had been redirected from the intro to a standalone page. One user skipped the auto COE flow. Only one of the 4 participants that saw the auto COE seemed to understand that the auto COE was a different page. All four users on the auto COE screen found the COE download link and the PDF.
4. All users *did* enter the form using the “apply” action link, but most stumbled over the labeling. Only one participant read the “make changes” text, but didn’t understand that they needed to “apply” to make the change. Additionally, most users recognized they linked from the auto COE screen back to the form.
5. All users were confident of their choices on the “loan intent” screen, but all paused to talk through the options. Only one user felt there should be more info to clarify those options. Four of five participants proceeded successfully through the document uploader screen, though only one user clearly noted that they had seen the list of documents that needed to be uploaded. One participant missed the “What kind of document are you uploading?” dropdown and could not continue. One user said having to upload a DD214 would cause them to abandon the form. 
6. Three participants said they would go to the benefits records page and one user expected a COE to be available in their logged in profile.
