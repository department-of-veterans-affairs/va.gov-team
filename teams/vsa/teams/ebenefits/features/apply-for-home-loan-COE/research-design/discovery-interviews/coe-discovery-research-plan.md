#### Background
Recipients of VA compensation and pension (C&P), or educational (EDU) payments can elect to have deposits made directly to their checking or savings account via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). These recipients include Veterans and qualifying dependents, and payments are made from C&P, GI Bill and Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) programs.

Direct deposits for C&P and EDU (GI Bill and VR&E) payments are set up and managed independently. Management of EDU payments is being migrated from eBenefits to be co-located with the C&P direct deposit feature in VA.gov profile. Users will be able to view and edit their direct deposit information for both types of payments in their profile.

### Goals
The goal of this usability study is to assess how easily participants locate, understand and can change their direct deposit information. We also want to determine what value users place on having both DD payment types displayed, whether the user receives both types of payments or not.

#### Guiding questions
- Where on VA.gov do users expect to find direct deposit (DD) information? 
- How often do users expect to review and/or update their DD information?
- What barriers prevent users from easily submitting changes to their DD info?
- How do users react to the two different "categories" of payments--and having to change them separately? 
- What other features do users expect on the DD screen?

#### Hypotheses
- Users may have some difficulty locating their direct deposit information
- Users will rarely, some occasionally, change their direct deposit information
- Participants will accept and easily navigate the DD edit function
- Participants will have some questions/hesitation about **two** distinct Direct Deposit features
- Users may want more information about the DD change process

### Method
We will engage in moderated usability testing conducted remotely using Zoom. Remote testing is currently the only viable option, but the method should yield acceptable observations on which to base findings. Participants will be recruited using Perigean. These users will be asked to explore VA.gov (home), then will be provided links to a prototype of the DD-EDU feature (likely to include some protion of Profile). The sessions will be recorded, and observers and notetakers may be in attendance.

#### The process
- There will be a quick warm-up and introduction to usability testing
- The user will be aked to navigate to VA.gov 
- The moderator will outline a scenario (use case) for the participant to follow
- The participant will aske to locate the DD feature
- After a brief period exploring a pth to DD, the users will be provided a link to the DD prototype
- The user will potentially proceed through review and editing of direct deposit info
- There will be a quick Q/A and wrap-up
