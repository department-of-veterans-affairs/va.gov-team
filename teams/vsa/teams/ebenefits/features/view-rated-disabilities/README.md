# Executive Summary
Rated Disabilities is a common function among the veteran community to see what their Total Calulated Disability Rating is, what has factored into that calculation and what is currently pending from the Claim Status Tool.  These data are important as they inform the Veteran what their service connected rating is and what benefits they might be elegible for.  

## User Problem Statement  
As a Veteran, I want to be able to view my Rated Disabilities quickly and easily after logging in to VA.gov.  Currently, a user might login to VA.gov, but then need to go over to ebenefits.va.gov and that might not be intuitive.  

## Solution Goals  
As with several other features within eBenefits, the effort primarily involves migrating the Rated Disabilities feature into VA.gov so that it can be viewed easily from a link from within their profile.  

### User Goals  
Presenting the Veterans Rated Disabilities information quickly and clearly without logging in, or visiting, another page.  

### Business Goals
The VA will see an added benefit in that a significant percentage of its traffic looking for this information will be better informed and receive the benefits they deserve.    

## Assumptions
The migration will be a critical strategy in getting this feature into a modern development environment and its new location will provide smoother access at the user level.
