_These links/reviews may end up being consolidated, stay tuned._
- [x] Before launch, circle back with Content/IA about further impact and feedback  

### Usability
- [x] Create a [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/research-plan-template.md)
  - [ ] Is the entry point established?
    - A gateway link has not yet been determined as a final location
    - There have been discusssions about linking back and forth with the Rated Disbalities Tool from the Disbailities Rating Calculator
- [x] 508 Compliance

- [x] Conduct a usability study
  - [x] Address any feedback from that study

## Development
_Do we need to merge the FE and BE tasks?_  
### General Engineering Tasks  
- [ ] Documentation for quickly addressing when things go wrong  
- [ ] Establish contacts for oncall support: who do we contact if the application is failing?  What kinds of failure modes are likely? 
 
### Backend Tasks  
- [x] Investigation of applicable services  
  - [x] Does the feature use the `vets-api` or `EVSS` service?
  - [x] Review `vets-api` endpoints or does an `api` exist, need to be built?
  - [x] Does EVSS need to be engaged? And how?
  - [x] Collaborate with Frontend on Error Handling
  - [x] Investigate  the common area for error types
  - [x] Define or reference a known resource
- [x] For PRs: first review internally with BE or another engineer before the BE Team
  - [x] `Once internally reviewed, share with the BE Review Team at VSP (team name?)`
  - [x] Ensure that feature toggles are set appropriately to be toggled
- [x] Documentation and points of contact for any new backend dependencies - see Product Outline for contact info

### Frontend Tasks
- [x] Investigation
  - [x] What will be involved in using the `vets-api`service to pull and display data?
  - [x] List and define what the main components will be for the feature to function properly
  - [x] Collaborate with Backend on Error Handling
  - [x] Investigate  the common area for error types
  - [x] Define or reference a known resource
- [x] For PRs: first review internally with FE or another engineer before the FE Team
  - [x] Once internally reviewed, share with the FE Review Team at the VSP (team name?)
  - [x] Ensure that feature toggles are set appropriately to be toggled
  - [x] Entrance pages (i.e. supporting static content) in place

## Review
### Error Handling
- [x] After we understand how the data behaves, have a meeting to brainstorm about as many use cases as possible
  - [x] Has each field been addressed for errors?
  - [x] Has each component been addressed for errors?
- [x] Address errors handling with [this guide](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/messaging-error-messages) in mind
  - Be mindful of others that are not planned.
Error handling might be iterative.
 
### Security/ATO - `ON HOLD until Andrea Hewitt reaches out`
- [ ] Establish who among VSP we should talk to about Security Reviews
  - [ ] What is the review process?  Same as QA?
- [ ] Review the [ATO Procedures](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/security/security-review-process.md)
- [ ] Request a [preliminary ATO review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/security/security-review-process.md)
- [ ] Request a [pre-launch ATO review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/security/security-review-process.md)

### QA
- [x] [Documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/quality-assurance) from platform [#3099](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/3099)

### Testing
- [x] Create a test plan from an overall engineering perspective  
  - [x] Build, test, audit (508, content, security, load, CI/CD, passing on all browsers, etc) in a feedback loop  
  - [x] Code coverage requirements (unit tests)
- [x] Develop testing infrastructure, refer to established documentation  
- [x] Define threshold or definition of high-severity bugs
- [ ] Document any high-severity bugs for future reference  
- [x] Establish contacts for errors to be reported to
  - [x] Errors get sent directly to the team
- [x] Establish steps to take to move feature into [staging](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/Administrative/accessing-staging.md) or within 
- [x] Tested in prod with back-of-house people and systems

## Analytics
