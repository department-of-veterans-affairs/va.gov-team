**VSA eBenefits Team | January 2021 - Present**  

This is to help guide and memorialize decisions made about different functionalities and behaviors for the feature we are working with.  
-------------

## Discussion of Unknowns  
`January 2021`  
These are some consideration around expected behaviors for this feature and possibly a list of recommendations
  
### Objectives for this feature
1. Modal that asks to verify dependents
2. Sub questions that pose the questoin on a per dependent basis and move the Veteran towards the approriate action item

### Questions about how this feature should behave
1. When does the modal show?
- If it get  skipped when does it come back?
- If partly answered, what then
- If answered, when does it come back?

2. If the Veteran is shown a list (in the modal) of dependents of 6 dependents, nd only 3 are addressed, does the list get reduced to 3?

### Issues
1. The modal feels heavy handed 
1. The modal might have 508 issues

### Potential Solutions
1. Banner
(could introduce banner fatigue, depending on how it gets implemented
