## Overview
Dependency Verification gives a quick and easy opportunity for a Veteran to update the VA on whenther the dependents on their award is are accurate.  This is important because the VA would like to reduce the almost $250 million dollars in over payments made every year as well as relieve VEterans of unneccessary debt.

## Problem Statement
Veterans are currently asked to update their dependents by mailed paper letter only every 8 years.  This results in a very low quality feedback loop of what dependents are intended to be on award.  USing existing Diary Entries, we can determine if the Veteran needs to update their verification and show them a list of their dependents and ask if they are correct.  If they are correct, we submit a 21-0538 on thier behalf that will route through Centralized Mail and update their Diary Entry to ask again in 1 year.  Else, the Veteran is given an iopportunity to update their dependents if needed.  

It has been discussed to update the Diary Entry directly, but there are a few challenges with that as it is unknown if editing those numbers can be done safely by us. We are currently using a modal window to present the list of dependents.
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Veteran's can quickly, easily and regulary update the VA on their dependents' status' so that they aren't being overpaid.
- The VA will save close to $250 M a year in overpayments.
- Congressional obligations will be met.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Veterans ignore the modal window and another type of intercept would be needed.

## Desired Business Outcomes

- The VA will save close to $250 M a year in overpayments.
- Congressional obligations will be met.

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

### Initiatives
*Include initiatives (iterations, new features, etc.) to improve this product. See the [Initiative Brief Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/product/initiative-brief-template.md)*
