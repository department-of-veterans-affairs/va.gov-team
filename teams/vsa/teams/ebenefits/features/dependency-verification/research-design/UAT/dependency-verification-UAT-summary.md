## User acceptance testing
Sixteen UAT sessions were scheduled, three with VA employees and 13 recruited through Perigean. Of these sessions, 9 sessions were completed, 2 sessions could not be completed due to a log in issue, and 5 sessions were no shows.

## Conclusion
Of the sessions where the user's diary entry indicated they were due for verification, the front-end displayed the modal and confirmation. However, we had few users where the diary entry had updated as expected.
