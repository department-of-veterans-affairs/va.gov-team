_Quick reference to other features' launch events:_ [686](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits/features/view-update-dependents/launch-events.md), [POA](https://#), [Payment History](https://#), [PCPG](https://#), [LGY](https://#)  
# Launch Events
For **View dependents** and **Add or remove dependents** using the VA Form 21-686c/674    
`eBenefits | April-May-June 2020`  
## Considerations  
Set a date and walk back the various steps.  This achieves a few things:  
1. Allows for more accurate estimation of the actual launch date, from various segments (sprint/ days)
2. Sets the steps clearly and informs the team if there are any gaps that need to be addressed for either the current feature or the next
3. A tangible reference for the team to synchronize on where we are and where we are headed
4. Should assist in ticket creation  

## Unknowns
- BGS interactions
- Outcome of QA review
- Outcome of 508 review
- Stakeholder feedback

## Assumptions  
**Launch to prod:** 
**Number of work days:**  T from today   
**Number of sprints:**    

Most of View Dependents is finished, but with this timeline, the remaining steps (Including Collab Cycle) will need to be merged together.

Collaboration Cycle = 🌀  
May be more time intensive than anticipated = ⏳   
Clarification needed = 🤷‍♂️  
In progress, or about to be = 👈
