# Research plan for usability testing for Form 21-686c / staging environment
**VSA eBenefits Team | May-June 2020**

`James Adams, designer/researcher`

#### Background
VA uses the 21-686c (686) form to collect and process the information to allow a Veteran to add or remove dependents from their disability claim. Including the 21-674, the "686" supports eight discrete workflows When deployed to VA.gov, it will be one of the longer, more complex forms on the site. The new 686 was designed and developed using the conventions and constraints of the VA.gov form system. 

Usability testing was conducted using prototypes in [February, 2020.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits/features/view-update-dependents/research-design/686-form-gating-0220) Follow-up testing on the form as developed and deployed to VA.gov staging will be critical to uncovering potential problems in the "live" product--and testing will be valuable in highlighting the path to optimizing user satisfaction and overall form performance.

### Goals
The over-arching business goal of the 686 is the quick automatic processing of the greatest number of digitally submitted forms. To support this, the new digital version of the form must be as clear and succinct as possible to increase accuracy and reduce abandonment. For users, the 686 is a potentially long and convoluted form; it is imperative to minimize potential  confusion and consolidate the form's flow.

#### Determine if users understand and accept the multi-purpose nature of the form
 - Observe users' interactions with workflow not tested in the prototype usability sessions (death, child marriage, divorce, etc.)
 - Determine if users notice/understand the form-within-form nature of the 21-686c and 21-674
 - Observe how users interact with the form review accordions

#### Decide what support users need to navigate and successfully submit the form
 - Determine what instructions, guidance and examples will be helpful within form workflows not tested in the prototype usability sessions (death, child marriage, divorce, etc.)
 - Assess user acceptance of various "remove" workflows; pay particular attention to the emotional nature of the scenarios.
 - Assess users' understanding and acceptance of "tell-me-more" accordions, particularly in workflows requiring uploaded documentation

#### Determine if users identify cases requiring additional documentation
 - Confirm that introductory text informs users about upload requirements
 - Determine if users understand the scenarios/workflows where additional information is needed
 - Assess users' understanding of the upload process, and it's placement within workflows

#### Discover any problems that arise from longer/complicated chapter combinations
 - Determine potential issues with particular flows: 
   - Add-spouse/report-divorce
   - Add-spouse/add-child workflow combinations
   - Add-child/add-student workflow combinations
   - Report-divorce/remove-stepchild workflow combinations
 - Note any potential problems with list/loop feature

### Research questions
1. In what section of VA.gov would users expect to find the 21-686c? How would they navigate there?
2. Are the form instructions clear and complete? Will users know what documents and info they will need to complete the form?
3. Do participants understand how the 21-686c works as a multi-purpose form?
4. What are the "sticking points" in the various form workflows? What workflow combinations cause users problems (add-spouse/add-child, add-child/add-student, add spouse/report divorce)?
5. Where do users need examples, more guidance or improved section headers as they interact with the form?
6. Will users understand when and how to upload additional documentation?
7. Is the information on the confirmation page clear and complete?
8. How will users interact with the form review accordions?
9. Can users complete the longer scenarios in 30 minutes or less?

**Additional Questions**
10. What are users' experiences with dependents on their VA benefits, and the current 21-686c (paper, digital, VSO, etc.)?
11. What workflow combinations (scenarios) do users consider likely? 

### Hypotheses
The 686 is a long and complicated form in its entirety, but the digital version should prove less daunting because it features user-selectable workflows and "step-by-step" chapter-based screens.

 - Users will quickly grasp the checkbox selection feature, and combination workflows will be easily understood.
 - Users will only scan the introduction screen, and will require additional clarification or guidance at various points (e.g. VA file number, dates within 674, financial questions) 
 - User acceptance and understanding of the upload feature will be spotty since it requires reading intro and helper text; the upload feature may create some confusion/frustration with its position at the end of the form.
 - Users will understand and accept the longer workflows
 - The list/loop pattern may create some confusion (odd button sequences)
 - Divorce plus stepchild combination may be problematic as they are long and require detailed (potentially emotionally-charged) information.
 - The form review accordions will prove challenging to participants because of page depth, and the potentially large number of section in longer workflows.

#### Success
This research effort will be successful if it gives clear indications regarding the usability of the 21-686c (and 21-674) form flows. This does not necessarily mean the layouts and patterns are validated, rather it means there is an actionable path forward to refine these tools for maximum clarity and effectiveness. Specifically, several things need to be determined:
 - Will users understand and accept the multi-purpose nature of the form
 - What guidance (instructional text, headers, etc.) will users need to support successful completion of the form
 - Will users understand when additional information is required; and how to upload it
 - Are there any workflow combinations that would be problematic for users due to length and/or information detail required

### Method
Usability testing will be conducted remotely using Zoom. Participants will be provided login credentials to a test account that will support their designated scenarios. These users will be given situations and a set tasks to perform. Workflows and tasks may be broken into separate groups, so users may run through the form multiple times. The moderator will guide and prompt users; observers and note-takers will document issues the participant encounter, as well as noting sections that users navigated easily.

This methodology allows for direct observation of users interactions with a near-final product. This will allow the team to capture real-time feedback on a "live" product.

### Participants and recruitment
Participants will be recruited via Perigean. The study will require 12 Veterans from a variety of service backgrounds. These participants will be divided into two groups. Each group will be give a set of scenarios/task to complete using the form. This will allow full coverage of all workflows. Criteria include:

#### All participants
- Recruitment through Perigeon
  - 14 participants will be scheduled by Perigeon
  - Our expectation is to interview 10 veterans.
    - We are anticipating 4-6 no-shows based on veterans showing up more during the stay at home order
- All genders
- Computer access and basic computer literacy
- Total Rated Disability of 30% or greater
- Several Veterans (3+) with Total Rated Disability of 80% or greater and cognitive disabilities
- Sessions will run approximately 60 minutes

#### Group 1
- Fits any of the following:
  - Have or had dependents; received or applied for dependents benefits
  - Has recently been married/divorced
  - Has experienced dependent status change such as, marriage, death, leaving school
  
#### Workflow set 1
- Add spouse/Report divorce
- Report death
- Add student
- Report student left school
  
#### Group 2
- Fits any of the following:
  - Have or had dependents; received or applied for dependents benefits
  - Has child (age 18 to 23) who is about to enroll or has enrolled in college
  - Has recently been divorced
  
#### Workflow set 2
- Add spouse/Add child
- Report death
- Report marriage of child
- Report divorce/Remove stepchild

### Timeline
The target window for research sessions is TBD, pending completion of 21-686c in VA.gov staging. Preparation includes participant recruitment, UI/UX review and refinement, conversation guide revision, and a pilot (test) session. 

#### Pilot session
The target date for the pilot session is TBD.
