# Research plan for usability testing for Form 21-686c / staging environment
**VSA eBenefits Team | May-June 2020**

`James Adams, designer/researcher`

#### Background
VA uses the 21-686c (686) form to collect and process the information to allow a Veteran to add or remove dependents from their disability claim. Including the 21-674, the "686" supports eight discrete workflows When deployed to VA.gov, it will be one of the longer, more complex forms on the site. The new 686 was designed and developed using the conventions and constraints of the VA.gov form system. 

Usability testing was conducted using prototypes in [February, 2020.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits/features/view-update-dependents/research-design/686-form-gating-0220) Follow-up testing on the form as developed and deployed to VA.gov staging will be critical to uncovering potential problems in the "live" product--and will be valuable in highlighting the path to optimizing user satisfaction and overall form performance.

### Goals
The over-arching business goal of the 686 is the quick automatic processing of the greatest number of digitally submitted forms. To support this, the new digital version of the form must be as clear and succinct as possible to increase accuracy and reduce abandonment.

#### Determine if the checkbox selection is an acceptable way for users to enter the form
 - Determine typical usage scenarios and frequency
 - Uncover user-expected flows to the 21-686 form
 - Assess ease of entry from introduction page to the 21-686c form itself
 - Determine if users can differentiate purposes of 21-686c from 21-674
 - Determine if users can easily understand the a-la-carte selection of vearious workflows (checkboxes)
 - Observe whether can access the 674-only workflow

#### Decide what support users need to navigate and successfully submit the form
 - Determine what instructions, guidance and examples will be helpful within form workflows
 - Observe whether section and subsection headers, and labeling are clear and helpful
 - Assess users' acceptance and understanding of upload mechanism and requirements
 - Determine if users quickly understand the different "add" and "remove" scenarios

#### Confirm the proper "chaptering" of the various business workflows
 - Assess whether users can differentiate individual sections
 - Confirm that current form sections are appropriate alone and in a series
 - Determine if the accordions in the confirmation sections are manageable for users

#### Discover any problems that arise from longer/complicated chapter combinations
 - Assess user acceptability of add-spouse marriage history sections
 - Determine potential issues with add-spouse and report-divorce workflow combinations
 - Determine if the overall length of add-spouse/add-child/add-student combo is acceptable
 - Note any potential problems with list/loop feature
 - Assess user acceptance of various "remove" workflows

### Hypotheses
The 686 is a long and complicated form in its entirety, but the digital version should prove less daunting because it features user-selectable workflows and "step-by-step" chapter-based screens.

 - Users will accept the checkbox selection of multiple forms, but will be wary about picking too many workflows at once.
 - Users will require clatification or guidance at various points; The upload feature may create some confusion/frustration with its position at the end of the form.
 - Users may not be immediately aware of the change in workflow "chapters" as they navigate the form. 
 - Some users will find the add-spouse workflow will be problematic in it's length and the repetitive section of former marriages. The "remove" dependent flows will be easily understood.

### Research questions
1. In what section VA.gov would users expect to find the 21-686c? How would they navigate there?
2. Are the form instructions clear and complete?
3. Do participants understand how the 21-686c works as a multi-purpose form?
4. What are the "sticking points" in the various form workflows? What workflow combinations cause users problems (add-spouse/add-child, add-child/add-student, add spouse/report divorce)?
5. Where do users need examples, more guidance or improved section headers as they interact with the form?
6. Will users understand when and how to upload additional documentation?
7. Is the information on the confirmation page clear and complete?
8. Can users complete the longer scenarios is less than 30 minutes?

Additional Questions

9. What are users' experiences with dependents on ther VA benefit and the current 21-686c (paper, digital, VSO, etc.)?
10. What workflow combinations (scenarios) do users consider likely? 
  
#### Success
This research effort will be successful if it gives clear indications regarding the usability of the 21-686c (and 21-674) form flows. This does not necessarily mean the layouts and patterns are validated, rather it means there is an actionable path forward to refine these tools for maximum clarity and effectiveness. Specifically, several things need to be determined:
 - Will users understand and accept the checkbox selection of various workflows
 - What guidance (intructional text, headers, etc.) will users need to support successful completeion of the form
 - How will users react to the long, potentially emotional add-spouse workflow
 - Are there any workflow combinations that would be problematic for users

### Method
Usability testing will be conducted remotely using Zoom or GoToMeeting. Participants will be provided login credentials to a test account that will support their designated scenarios. These users will be given situations and a set tasks to perform. Workflows and tasks may be broken into separate groups, so users may run through the form multiple times. The moderator will guide and prompt users; observers and note-takers will document issues the participant encounter, as well as noting sections that users navigated easily.

### Participants and recruitment
Participants will be recruited via Perigean. The study will require 12 Veterans from a variety of service backgrounds. These participants will be divided into two groups. Criteria include:

#### All participants
- 12 Veterans
- All genders
- Computer access and basic computer literacy
- Total Rated Disability of 30% or greater
- Several Veterans (3+) with Total Rated Disability of 80% or greater and cognitive disabilities
- Sessions will run approximately 45 minutes

#### Group 1
- Fits any of the following:
  - Have or had dependents; received or applied for dependents benefits
  - Has recently been married/divorced
  - Has experienced dependent status change such as, marriage, death, leaving school
  
  #### Group 2
- Fits any of the following:
  - Have or had dependents; received or applied for dependents benefits
  - Has child (age 18 to 23) who is about to enroll or has enrolled in college
  - Has recently been divorced

### Timeline
The target window for research sessions is TBD, pending competion of 21-686c in VA.gov staging. Preparation includes participant recruitment, UI/UX review and refinement, conversation guide revision, and a pilot (test) session. 

#### Pilot session
The target date for the pilot session is TBD.
