**VSA eBenefits Team | May-June 2020**

### Setup
- Slack #feedback-backchannel will be used for real-time feedback from observers
- Attendee/Observer instructions, including instructions for #feedback-backchannel, will be sent out ahead of the sessions
- Sessions will be conducted remotely, setup will be tested 15 minutes prior to call-time
- [Associated Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits/features/view-update-dependents/research-design/686-usability-staging-0520/686-usability-staging-research-plan.md)

### Priorities
While it will be important to cover as much of this guide as possible during user sessions, time and circumstances may dictate that some questions be skipped. The most important aspect of this conversation guide is to orient the participant to what they will be seeing. This will mitigate in-session confusion, and help the participant provide more relevant feedback.

## Intro
Good morning/afternoon and thank you for joining us today. With me are a few colleagues who are helping-out by observing and taking notes. We are part of a team with the Department of Veterans Affairs that is moving some features of the old eBenefits site over to VA.gov. We're learning what veterans need to improve their online experience, and how we can make VA.gov more useful for you. Our particular focus today is the Disability Benefits sections.

I have a few things I need to mention before we start:
- The session should take about 60 minutes (confirm timeframe). But you can end it at any point--just let me know. We have quite a few things to cover, so to respect your time, I may occasionally break-in to move us to the next item.
- We're not testing **you** in any way--there are no right or wrong answers. We want to hear your thoughts about what we show you so that we can make improvements to VA.gov.
- Don't worry, I will not be offended by any opinions you express. Please be open about what you think.
- Today we'll be working with a test version of a product we're developing. Most things will work, but there may be a few that don't behave the way you'd expect. Because we are using a test account and a test environment, none of your actions will affect your account or any VA information.
- We'd like to record this session. This will give a record to use for note-taking. We'll store the recording on a private drive, and it will be deleted when we conclude our testing and note-taking. No personal identifying information will be transcribed.
- I'll ask "on the record" once the recording starts.
- OK, now that I'm recording, do I have your permission to record this session?

## Warm-up
**Moderator-** Would you tell me a little bit about yourself? Your service experience, where you live, general experiences with the VA... </br>


**Moderator-**  Do you have a VA Disability Rating? Can you tell me, generally, about dependents you may have claimed on your VA benefit?

**Moderator-** How often do you visit the eBenefits site? How about VA.gov; how often do you visit that site? Any other sites?

**Moderator-** In the past, how have you added or changed dependents on your VA benefit?

**Moderator-** And last, before we look at the test pages, if you wanted to add or change a dependent on your VA benefit now, what would you do? This can be online or otherwise: website, phone call, in-person... 

### User screenshares
- Click on staging link (home or form intro?)
- Cut/paste login; cut/paste password
- Click through sign-in screens
- Etc.

**Moderator-**
**Now we're ready to start.** Because dependents are family-members, some of the scenarios I have on my list (like divorce, children leaving home and even death) may be hard for you to get through. Please let me know if you'd like to skip a particular task, and we'll move to another.

We'll be exploring made-up scenarios that don't necessarily apply to you. In any case you are free to use names and dates from your past--or even fake names and numbers. Nothing will be submitted because this is a test system. However, please don't use real social security numbers--1234567890 should work in those cases.

## Wrap-up
Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here.
- Is there anything you'd like to add--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at--or VA.gov in general?
- Would you consider being involved in future follow-up sessions?

## Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
