# Conversation guide for usability testing for Form 21-686c / staging environment
**VSA eBenefits Team | May-June 2020**

### Setup
- Slack #feedback-backchannel will be used for real-time feedback from observers
- Attendee/Observer instructions, including instructions for #feedback-backchannel, will be sent out ahead of the sessions
- Sessions will be conducted remotely, setup will be tested 15 minutes prior to call-time
- [Associated Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits/features/view-update-dependents/research-design/686-usability-staging-0520/686-usability-staging-research-plan.md)

### Priorities
While it will be important to cover as much of this guide as possible during user sessions, time and circumstances may dictate that some questions be skipped. The most important aspect of this conversation guide is to orient the participant to what they will be seeing. This will mitigate in-session confusion, and help the participant provide more relevant feedback.

## Intro
Good morning/afternoon and thank you for joining us today. With me are a few colleagues who are helping-out by observing and taking notes. We are part of a team with the Department of Veterans Affairs that is moving some features of the old eBenefits site over to VA.gov. We're learning what veterans need to improve their online experience, and how we can make VA.gov more useful for you. Our particular focus today is the Disability Benefits sections.

I have a few things I need to mention before we start:
- The session should take about 60 minutes (confirm timeframe). But you can end it at any point--just let me know. We have quite a few things to cover, so to respect your time, I may occasionally break-in to move us to the next item.
- We're not testing **you** in any way--there are no right or wrong answers. We want to hear your thoughts about what we show you so that we can make improvements to VA.gov.
- Don't worry, I will not be offended by any opinions you express. Please be open about what you think.
- Today we'll be working with a test version of a product we're developing. Most things will work, but there may be a few that don't behave the way you'd expect. Because we are using a test account and a test environment, none of your actions will affect your account or any VA information.
- We'd like to record this session. This will give a record to use for note-taking. We'll store the recording on a private drive, and it will be deleted when we conclude our testing and note-taking. No personal identifying information will be transcribed.
- I'll ask "on the record" once the recording starts.
- OK, now that I'm recording, do I have your permission to record this session?

## Warm-up
- Would you tell me a little bit about yourself? Your service experience, where you live, general experiences with the VA...
- Do you have a VA Disability Rating? Can you tell me, generally, about dependents you may have claimed on your VA benefit?
- How often do you visit the eBenefits site? How about VA.gov; how often do you visit that site? Any other sites?
- In the past, how have you added or changed dependents on your VA benefit?
- And last, before we look at the test pages, if you wanted to add or change a dependent on your VA benefit now, what would you do? This can be online or otherwise: website, phone call, in-person... 

### User screenshares
- Click on staging link (home or form intro?)
- Cut/paste login; cut/paste password
- Click through sign-in screens
- Etc.

**Now we're ready to start.** Because dependents are family-members, some of the scenarios I have on my list (like divorce, children leaving home and even death) may be hard for you to get through. Please let me know if you'd like to skip a particular task, and we'll move to another.

We'll be exploring made-up scenarios that don't necessarily apply to you. In any case you are free to use names and dates from your past--or even fake names and numbers. Nothing will be submitted because this is a test system. However, please don't use real social security numbers--1234567890 should work in those cases.

## Workflow set 1 scenarios

1. You recently remarried after getting divorced. You need to add your new spouse as a dependent, and report that you are no longer married to your ex-spouse. (This scenario will involve add-spouse and report-divorce workflows either separately or in combination.)

2. You now have an 18-year-old stepchild who is going to college in the fall. You never claimed this person as a dependent. (This scenario will require add-child and add-student (674) in combination.)

3. Moving a few years in the future, two major events have occurred close together. Your spouse's elderly parent, whom you claimed as a dependent, has recently passed. You need to report this to VA. And your now 21-year-old stepchild just graduated college, and is no longer considered a dependent by VA. (This scenario will involve report-death and report-student-left-school workflows either separately or in combination.)

## Workflow set 2 scenarios
1. You recently married and your spouse has two children. You want to claim all them as dependents. (This scenario will involve add-spouse and add-child workflows either separately or in combination.)

2. Move forward years later, and you've had a recent divorce. Your ex-spouse and stepchildren have moved on. (This scenario will involve report-divorce and remove-stepchild workflows either separately or in combination.)

3. Moving a few years in the future, two major events have occurred close together. Your spouse's elderly parent, whom you claimed as a dependent, has recently passed. You need to report this to VA. And your child is 17, but, with your consent, has recently married. You need to let VA know. (This scenario will involve report-death and report-child-marriage workflows either separately or in combination.)

## Usability tasks

### Introduction and checkbox selection | 5 minutes
- Find out what you'll need to complete and submit the form for the particular scenario (above).
- Select the options for your particular scenario (above).

#### Things to look for:
- Do users read (or even scan) the introduction text, and can they find the info or documents they'll need
- Are users selecting the correct workflow(s)
- Are there any emotional reactions to the verbiage in the 'remove' workflows (divorce, death)

### Complete the selected workflow(s) | 10 to 20 minutes
- Complete the form using made-up information

#### Things to look for:
- Where do users stop and look for clarification or guidance
- Do users open/read tell-me-mores
- How long do users take to complete the various screens
- Will users recall instructions from the intro screen
- When and where does "form-fatigue" set in

### Upload additional documentation | 5 minutes
- If the scenario requires it, find and upload a test document

#### Things to look for:
- Do users know when they should upload documentation
- Will users recall info or prompts regarding documentation from the intro or tell-me-mores
- How do users interact with the upload feature

### Review and return to start | 5 minutes
- (at the review screen) Be sure you entered the form info correctly
- What could your do if there was an error you wanted to fix
- Submit the form
- What should you do next

#### Things to look for:
- How do user manage the Review Screen
- Do users read and understand the confirmation page text
- Will users expect any functionality or feature that aren't present
- How do users navigate back to the start of the form

## Wrap-up
Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here.
- Is there anything you'd like to add--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at--or VA.gov in general?
- Would you consider being involved in future follow-up sessions?

## Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
