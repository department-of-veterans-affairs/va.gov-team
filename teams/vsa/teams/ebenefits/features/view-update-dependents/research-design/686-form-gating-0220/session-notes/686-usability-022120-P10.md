 - Participant is OK to record
 - five years in Army in Korea, then in Miami
 - Got married, so used eBenefits to add spouse
 - familiar with the 21-686c
 - Not familiar with VA.gov home; remembers eBenefits
 - Looks at megamenu, looks at disability
 - looking for dependency link in menu
 - First impression looks simple easy to get through, seems to have all the info needed
 - Clicks both checkbox options, no issue selects multiple for both spouse and child
 - All looks like pretty standard info
 - would have e-mail if you had an account, seems to be missing
 - any differences/comparisons with benefits; remembers info was split in eBenefits
 - Reads info about additional info
 - opens tell-me-more
 - Looks like basic information need to verify tells you what you need.
 - looks pretty simple
 - click former spouse info looks pretty simple
 - child info moves through clicks stepchild
 - you could group some info together on one screen
 - all on one page is a lot easier
 - add child could all be on same page
 - reads tellmmore for upload
 - asking for both parents birth certificate is redundant
 - on accordion page, assume it was what was entered
 - Accordions as expected
 - says you have to review each one, you might as well review it all
 - finds checkbox and hits submit
 - what if there was a confirmation number wants to know that the application was actually submitted
 - Reads confirmation page
 - says it’s pretty standard
 - sees link to form 
 - refreshes link to get to form starting point
 - remove stepchild is pretty standard
 - asked about support understands that support equals responsibility
 - added person child lives with understand 
 - accepts terms and submits
 - still wants confirmation number; wants confirmation number to make case with VA
 - would prefer to handle multiple addition all at once
 - didn’t like screens with just one question; prefer to put together questions on one screen
 - No issue with adding personal info/divorce/spouse/etc.
 - If you have a ssn you don’t need birth certificate. ssn makes it easy
 - if didn’t have BC that would hold up
 - Experience is about the same with eBenefits
 - web page design is different, but just as easy
 - Normally uses a laptop for forms and web browsing
 - expect the form to be under disability
