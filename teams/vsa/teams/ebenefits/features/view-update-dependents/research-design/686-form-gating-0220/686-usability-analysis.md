## Research goals
**Some background:** VA uses the 21-686c (686) form to collect and process the information to allow a Veteran to add dependents to their disability claim. The same form is used to remove dependents who have died or otherwise left the household of the Veteran.

The 686 is 12 pages in its paper incarnation, and it supports eight discrete workflows (eBenefits adds the 21-674). Once deployed to VA.gov, the 686 will be one of the site’s  longer, more complex forms . The new 686 must be developed within the conventions and constraints of the VA.gov form system. Usability testing will be critical to uncovering potential problems in the prototype workflows--and illuminating the solutions that will provide an optimal user experience.

**Our research goals:** The over-arching business goal of the 686 is the quick automatic processing of the greatest number of digitally submitted forms. To support this, the new digital version of the form must be as clear and succinct as possible to increase accuracy and reduce abandonment.

- Is the checkbox selection an acceptable way for users to select options and enter the form?
- What support will users need to navigate and successfully submit the form?
- Have we properly "chaptered" the various business workflows; does the "flow" make sense to users?
- What problems arise from longer/complicated chapter combinations?

**Our hypotheses:** The 686 is a long and complicated form in its entirety, but the digital version should prove more user-friendly with user-selectable workflows and "step-by-step" chapter-based screens.

- Users will accept the checkbox selection of multiple forms but will be wary about picking too many workflows at once
- Users will require clarification or guidance at various points; The upload feature may create some confusion/frustration with its position at the end of the form
- Users may not be immediately aware of the change in workflow "chapters" as they navigate the form
- Some users will find the add-spouse workflow will be problematic in its length and the repetitive section of former marriages. The "remove" dependent flows will be easily understood

## Research methodology 

**Our methodology:** Usability testing was conducted remotely using Zoom. Participants were spilt into two groups and were given either “add spouse & child/remove child” or “add student/remove student” tasks. Both groups were given wayfinding, intro, selection, review and confirmation tasks. Users were presented with a high-fidelity prototype created using Adobe XD.

The moderator prompted users with tasks and questions from the conversation guide. Participants were encouraged to talk through their exploration of the prototypes, and to speak candidly about their impressions. Remote observers and note takers were in attendance, and all sessions were recorded.

**Who we talked to:**
- Eight Veterans total, all with a 30% or higher disability rating
- Four have experience adding spouse to disability benefits
- Three have experience claiming children over 18 enrolled in school
- One has a child and will go through the process of claiming them for college in five years 
- One Veteran with 80% or higher disability rating and cognitive disabilities
- Geographically diverse: MD, CA, FL, IA, PA 
- Participant ages ranged from 25-74 years
- Two were familiar with the 21-686c

**Our guiding questions:**
- Where on VA.gov would participants expect to add or remove dependents from their disability award?
- Do participants understand the 21-686c is a multi-purpose form? And do they understand and accept the "checkbox" selection of the various 686 workflows?
- Are the forms presented clearly and easy to understand by Veterans?
- Where do users need examples, guidance or section headers as they interact with the form?
- Where are the pain points in the longer workflows (add-spouse/add-child, add-student)?
- What are users' experiences with the current 21-686c (paper, digital, VSO, etc.)?
- Do participants know they have to reports changes in their dependents' status?

## Key findings
**Our high-level findings:**
1. Participants initially expected to find the 21-686c in the VA.gov Family Benefits or Records sections
2. Users generally scanned the introduction page; once they were completing the form, they noted they needed additional information up-front (in the Introduction):
  - Married children
  - School addresses
  - Prior term school info (e.g. high school or college)
  - Student income/net worth
3. Additional explanation and guidance is needed for certain key sections of the form:
  - Spouse Veteran status
  - Marriage types
  - Service & file numbers
  - Student address
4. Participants accepted the checkbox "workflow" arrangement of the form without question; and users moved through both the long and short workflows of the form quickly, with little prompting
5. Many participants wanted printable versions of their form submission and/or a confirmation number as proof of submission; several asked for a "print" button

## Details of findings
**1. Wayfinding:** Only one user navigated from VA.gov home to the Add Dependents landing page, and they did so using the search field. Though a few users did look in Disability sections, most looked at Family Member Benefits; a few others looked at Records and elsewhere. All users seem to be looking for a clearly-marked, direct link, first in the home page's white quadrants, then in the megamenu. Two used the search feature (one successfully).

A few users clicked into Family member Benefits and Records content pages to find relevant links. Some participants given the "add student" task looked in the education sections of the home screen and megamenu.

**2. Form introduction:** Three-quarters of participants noted they would need to stop and look for info required to complete their tasks; two mentioned specifically that required info should be made clear in the introduction. Most of the "stopping-points" were within the 674 workflow (add student). Users stated they would have to look up several things, and they might need clarification:

 - Student address; is it their "permanent" or school address?
 - School address; is it main campus?
 - Term start and end dates; can these be post-dated?
 - Prior term's school info; high school and/or college?
 - Student finacial information (income & net worth)
 
 > “This is a lot of tax information that you may not have. I think this information should be included within the first page that you need.”
 
Two users wanted to know up-front about married children in the 686 and 674. Are they disqualified as dependents? (They are.) One user wondered about the implications of spouses who are also Veterans.

> “Are there implications if they have been married to someone that was in the military? A box that will explain what the implications are if they have VA benefits already.“
 
 **3. Clarification needed:** Although participants stated they found the form easy to use, most had at least one question in the course of completing their tasks; several users had two or more questions. Participants suggested inline help (e.g. tooltip hovers or ? icons) or clearer labeling would help.
 
  - Some users wanted more specifics about school and student addresses (which campus? home or school?) 
  - A pair of users wondered about the definition of some of the marriage types
  - Two users stated they didn't know what their service or file was
  
   > “Just the VA file number and service number, maybe an explanation for that. I don’t know if the service number is the same as your SSN.”
  
**4. Checkbox selection:** Participants uniformly understood and accepted the checkbox workflow selection, with 100% quickly selecting the correct choices to complete their given tasks. Users moved quickly past the selections task without hesitation. 

> “...it was self-explanatory whereas the paper form I was not sure."

One of the tasks (add spouse & child) required multiple selections and posed no problems. When asked post-test about submitting multiple workflows together or singly, users unanimously said "multiple." 

One user took exception to the use of "Report" in the labeling of the selections.

> ”Don’t tell me to report.”

**5. Confirmation & printing:** As with the introduction page, participants gave generally positive assessments of the confirmation page. However, many wanted more assurance that their forms were successfully submitted. One user said they would need “proof” when VA “didn’t get their form.” Half of users expected to be able view, print and/or download what they submitted, with one user wanting a filled-in version of the 21-686c (eBenefits has this feature). 

> “What I am missing is the form that I can print out that proves that I did it.”

Several users wanted a dedicated "print" button on-screen. Two users wanted assurance as to site and information security on the Confirmation page.

> “Maybe being able to print it off to save it as a file, people like to have the evidence that they submitted it at this time and this is what I put in there.“

## Additional insights
**Other things we learned:**
- No participant seemed to notice there were two forms presented: 21-686c and 21-674.
- Six participants (85.7%) said they would use a laptop or desktop computer to submit and print forms; one user (14.3%) preferred a tablet
- Though many users said they used their phones for browsing websites, none would use their phones for the tasks they were given
- The form does not directly accommodate a homeless Veteran or family member
- Two users (12.5%) commented on the green button on the intro page; one saying colorblind people might prefer yellow, the other said they were colorblind, but they knew it was green
- No participant used the "back" button at the bottom of each screen of the form

## Our conclusions
The 686 is a long and complicated form in its entirety, but the digital version should prove more user-friendly with user-selectable workflows and "step-by-step" chapter-based screens.

- The checkbox selection strategy is acceptable to users who did not pause for a moment before quickly and easily making the proper choices and moving on to the body of the form
- Participants did ask for guidance or clarification at key points of the “add spouse/add child” and add “student workflows;” specifically, they wanted more detailed info on marriage, addresses and dates
- Users were aware of “chapter” changes within the form, and tracked the changes in context
- The longest workflow, “add spouse/add child” was completed quickly; the shorter workflows took almost no time; 100% of users stated the form was easy to use

## Recommendations
**What we recommend:**
- Maintain the form’s checkbox selection screen; continue to refine selection text ("notify" vs. "report")
- Add guidance, examples and instructions to the marriage types and married child sections (686); and to the school term dates, prior school and student address sections (674) of the form
- Continue with the current designed flow of the form, but conduct follow-up usability testing on “live” pages after initial development to uncover pain points
- Add clarifying text to the introduction screen to better identify information needed to complete the form; include implications of potentially “disqualifying” statuses (e.g. married child, Veteran spouse)
- Investigate “printable form” feature in eBenefits, confirmation IDs, and “print” button functionality

## Next steps
**Present findings to eBenefits team**
- Share insights and recommendations; solicit further insights and get input on implementing recommendations

**Connect with stakeholders**
- Share research findings
- Get clarification on form and information requirements

**Work with content team on labelling, instructional text and Intro and Confirmation page copy**
