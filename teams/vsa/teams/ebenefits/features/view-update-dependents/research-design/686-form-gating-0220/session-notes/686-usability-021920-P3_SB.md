## Participant 3

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we&#39;re going to talk about adding and removing dependents to/from your benefits on the VA website.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.**  I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**  We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran&#39;s needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You&#39;ll be interacting with a prototype.**  This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it&#39;s a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - If yes:  **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

_Start recording._

- \*\*I have started recording. I&#39;d like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?&quot;

## **Warm-up Questions**

Before we look at the prototype, let&#39;s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Please tell me about your service history.

I joined in 82 and retired in 2004. 22 years in the Marine Corps.

- What are your experiences adding or removing dependents from your disability claim?

I really haven&#39;t had to do that, when I first got my disability my kids were younger and they must have fell off. My wife is still on there.

How did you add them- When I applied for disability I had them as dependents and my wife were factored in there.

- Are you familiar with the VA 21-686 form? And what is your experience using the form (online or paper)?

No, not with that.

## **Screenshare**

Will you share your screen with me? I&#39;m going to send you a link. I will be asking you to complete a few tasks using this prototype. Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through your actions.

## **First Task: Find and select form(s)**

You&#39;ve recently been married and want to add you new spouse and their child to your benefits. Show us how you would do this.

I would assume I would go to records.

What do you expect to see- I am recently married you said.

Yes you want to add your wife as a dependent- I don&#39;t know where I see it on here.

If you don&#39;t see it here, where would you look- Probably family member benefits.

Anything here- Benefits for spouses, maybe life insurance options.

What do you expect to see here- I am just adding her you say. Probably manage your policies and benefits.  Updated beneficiaries.

## **Second Task: Step through form**

Walk through the steps of this form. Be sure to think aloud and comment on the process of walking through the form.

In the middle add or remove a dependent.

Impression: It looks good. So, the benefits only go up to 23 now. I am just asking.

It depends for college age students I think but this is for general use.

What next: Claim benefits for spouse.

Anything else: No not really.

Adding them both: SO claim benefits for child. It depends if they are under 18. Click continue.

Now we will go through the form, feed back on fields or questions: No I mean it looks good. VA file number, what is that? I assume the service number is your SSN but the SSN is above that. It all looks good.

Next page, thoughts: It looks good. I don&#39;t see anything confusing or anything. Click continue.

Spouse information page: No it looks good.

If you filled this out, any questions: No. Clicks continue

Marriage information, thoughts, feedback, questions: No, I don&#39;t know what tribal or proxy marriage is.  It looks good. Clicks continue

Live with spouse: It looks good.

Marriage prior: No it looks fine.

Let&#39;s say for some reason you were married prior what would you do: Click yes.

Questions: No.

Former marriage information: makes sense: Yes.

Feedback: It looks self-explanatory.

Child information: Everything looks self-explanatory there. Next page

Childs place of birth:  looks self-explanatory.

What would you choose for these options: It depends, it would be a stepchild right.

Impressions, thoughts: It all looks fine.

Child live with you, makes sense to you: Yes.

Evidence page: Upload the birth certificate.

Why: Just to provide when he was born and the biological parents are.

Feedback: Nope.

## **Third Task: Review application - X minutes**

Take a moment to review the information presented on the screen.

- Click the area of the prototype to complete this application process.

It looks self-explanatory.

What do you assume the sections up here are for: Just supporting documentation on what you are trying to do.

What do you expect to see: For the child and birth certificate and for marriage it would be a marriage certificate. Dates of service, SSN, stuff like that.

Impression on the layout, does it make sense: looks self-explanatory.

What would you do to finish the application. Click I have read and accept then click submit.

Read the page and let me know if you have any questions or if anything doesn&#39;t make sense: Yeah, it looks good.

Let&#39;s say you submitted it and haven&#39;t heard anything back in a few weeks: I would call the toll free number.

Questions: No.

## **Fourth Task (if time): Remove**

Let&#39;s say that your step-child has moved out on their own. How would you go about removing them from your benefits?

OR

Let&#39;s say your child graduated college and is no longer eligible for your benefits. What would you do to remove them?

## **Post-Task Interview**

- Would you prefer to complete multiple tasks at the same time? Or individually?

With a child I would probably do it together.

- What are your thoughts on the length of the form?

It looks like a regular form.

Suggestions to update or change it: Just the VA file number and service number, maybe an explanation for that. I don&#39;t know if the service number is the same as your SSN.

- What are your thoughts on completing a form that requires this type of personal information?

Maybe have a statement stating that the information is secure.

- What would you change about this prototype

No I mean it looks good.

Favorite part: Favorite part about filling out form, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know what my favorite part is.

- What kind of device (mobile/desktop/tablet) do you use most often? Would you use that kind of device to fill this form out?

Tablet. More than likely, yeah.

Where do you expect to find this if you went to VA.gov: Probably under va benefits and healthcare.  Under family member benefits.

- Any questions for me?

Nothing really.

## **Thank-You and Closing**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I&#39;ll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
