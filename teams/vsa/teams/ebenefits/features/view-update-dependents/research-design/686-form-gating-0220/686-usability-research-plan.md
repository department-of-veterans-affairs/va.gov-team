### Goals
#### Support Required to Sucessfully Submit Form
TBD

#### Wayfinding/Navigation to Form
TBD

#### Gating Form (Business Process) Workflows
TBD

#### Hypothesis
TBD

#### Guiding Questions
[ Preliminary list... Work-in-progress ]
- Do participants undestand the 21-686c is a multi-purpose form?
- Do participants know they have to reports changes in their dependents status? Particularly things that remove them from their disability benefits, like marriage, leaving home, not attending school, etc.?
- Will participants accept the checkbox selection, and understand it makes the form "al-la-carte?"
- What are users' espectations about real-life scenarios (birth, death, divorce) and theri use of the 21-686c? Particularly, what (workflow) combinations would they expect are likely. 
- How do users feel about a 'worst-case" end-to-end form that included all scenarios? Would they rather submit different workflows separately of all together? Would they like "pre-packaged" scenarios (Add spouse/add child)
- How do user feel about the former spouse sections of the add-spouse workflow? What can we do do to make it more tolerable?
- Generally, is the labelling and section headers clear and helpful?
- Where do we need helper content like tell-me-mores or inline instructions.
- Is the chaptering of the form accetable? How is the balance of multiple chapters vs. page/form length?
- Is the list/loop pattern acceptable when entering multiple individuals (ex-spouses, children, students, etc.)?

#### Success
TBD

### Method
Usability testing will be conducted remotely using Zoom or GoToMeeting. Veterans will be presented with high-fidelity prototype created using Adobe XD. A remote moderator will prompt users with guiding questions (from the conversation guide). Participants will be encouraged to talk through their exploration of the prototypes. Remote observers and note takers will be in attendance.

### Participants and Recruitment
Participants will be recruited via Perigean. The study will require 8 Veterans from a range of service backgrounds. Participant criteria include:
- 8 Veterans
- Various service backgrounds
- Geographically diverse
- All genders
- Computer access and basic computer literacy
- Total Rated Disability of 30% or greater
- Several Veterans (3 to 4) with Total Rated Disability of 80% or greater and cognitive disabilities
- Have or had dependents; received or applied for dependents benefits
- Because XD prototypes will be presented, there is no support for users needing adaptive equipment or software
- Sessions will run approximately 30 minutes

### Timeline
