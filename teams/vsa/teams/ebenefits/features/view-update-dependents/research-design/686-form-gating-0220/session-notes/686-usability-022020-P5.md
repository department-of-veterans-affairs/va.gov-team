 - Serve history was OCS during 9/11 navy served on Lincoln security manager during Iraq war II
 - Way back sent in copies of birth certificate via mail added children
 - Has child going to school in five years
 - does not know 686 by number
 - Trouble clicking link
 - Would look on home screen looking at white boxes
 - looking for records or education something about dependents
 - Reads links in white boxes
 - did not see anything
 - finds family member benefits
 - would look at other options as well
 - Scan text on overview page looks at right sidebar content
 - clicks links for family member, dependents, survivors
 - scrolls screen does not find link looks at education training, but say don’t think so that’s just GI bill that’s not healthcare
 - Then would go to search (search terms?)
 - Opens XD link in new tab nothing distracting good! very focused good for older VA members
 - Button is helpful easy to see
 - Yellow is a good color for color blind
 - Scans subway map
 - second button is easy—don’t have to go back up
 - Selects checkbox option
 - Required is great may not know VA numbers are the same as SSN
 - include instructions in bold for each text field
 - Required stands out but labels do not
 - Emphasize labels
 - On address: homeless veterans may have an issue with completing form (good!)
 - Add another is good
 - What if student was married what would happen?
 - School was OK
 - Timeline for filling in form, when should someone send this in?
 - Post date form? (Good!)
 - School in last term 
 - Money info need to include tax info and marriage info (Good)
 - Stunt need to file taxes separately to get in-state tuition
 - Expects info to be what VA knows… not what was filled outRemove student has all review accordions
 - Line by line of what was filled out. Saw edit buttons for each sections
 - Like finish app later wish it was bigger
 - maybe a button that says save.
 - applied for job had three option on application screen
 - Make don’t apply again should be bold
 - Create one now, should have an account
 - Confirmation screen looks good 
 - went to home screen
 - found link then correct check box
 - Review screen of remove dependent went quickly
 - Wants verification
 - some indication of security
 - VA site has so many logins and it’s assumed safe
 - filling in for dependent and it’s not your own info
 - Add print button for page vs. ctrl-p
 - Would expect form under record, it’s not education, it’s not disability, it’s changing dependents
