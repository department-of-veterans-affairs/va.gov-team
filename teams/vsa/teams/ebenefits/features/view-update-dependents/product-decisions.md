# High Level Product Decisions: 21-686c Application
**VSA eBenefits Team | May 2020**  

This is to help guide and memorialize decisions made about different functionalities and behaviors for the feature we are working with.  
-------------
## Silent Submission Failures  
`Team Meeting July 16, 2020`  
**Ticket: [[SPIKE] Cross Discipline Analysis of User Feedback for Form Submissions #11270](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/11270)**  
We know that there may be some errors and given the length of our submission process, if there is a failure we don't have a great way of notifiying the user.

What are the situations where something fails?
Retryable error
Common

Fatal error
API is down and we get a 500 right away but only after the "health check" for BGS at VA file number check

When a user clicks submit, job gets fired, if there is break before vnp tables get contacted we should put something in there.

Can we expose to the user that there has been a failure? After 24 hours?

Does BGS ever return a message given a length of time? No, not really

Backend meeting: others share similar experiences, this is not unique to us

Some possible solutions: 
- Email: "Hey something is not right" using Gov Delivery
  - job succeeds, it made it to vnp tables, we're done, it will eventually show up in Claim Status Tool
  - job fails, we provide our own claim status tool and we comm to user that they need to try again
  
- Status Claim Tool: could we hand off an id for them to check
  - widget that checks for jobs running against a 686 application, indicates pending
- Healthcare app (first app that might have a precedent)
- Can we use SIP?
- Job Status Tool (specific to 526/EVSS) where hey pull and check the status of a job

_Note/ Guiding principle_
- Action item:
  - User journey maps
  - Research email procedures
    - Will an email need to be required?  or where will it come from?
    - Do we have permission to do this?
  - For knowing whether the submission was successful or not:  
    - We know if the submission hits vnpProcUpdate call - if we get our payload back its a STRONG indicator of success
    - If the Sidkiq job retries some number of times - all retries are exhausted but we are loking at what that confirmation of failure would be

**TL;DR - what does this mean?  what do we do next?**  
Lowest Level of Effort: Let it go as is and resolve going forward (post launch)  <- Eh, we can do better  
Next Highlest Level of Effort: We need to know what indicator there might be for a failed response, then we can send them an email. ✔️
Highest LEvel of Effort: Integrate status into Claim Status Tool  
Ideal: There is a confirmation number that ties to all of the above  

**Next steps:**
- Define and create a hook for failures
- If submission fails:
- Fire the email after hook retries some unmber of times
- If submission is succesful:
- Fire email with thank you message. 
or  
- do nothing, application said it was succesful

## Form ID  
`Team Meeting July 16, 2020`  
**Ticket: [Determine Form ID for Dependency Claims #11178](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/11178).**  

Seems like most things are using `686c-674` but `21-686c` is more inline with other form IDs but using has deeper implications across several things

Does backend know all the different places 
 - Yes but I am not sure if it is complete or what the implications

Implication:
- Pre-fill will need to be changed
- Schema would change
- PDF 
- Doc upload
- SIP

_Note/ Guiding principle_
- Action item

**TL;DR - what does this mean?  what do we do next?**  
Lets move forward with `686c-674` and post launch, we will reformat to some better consistency.  
FE will investigate and see if there is anything else that needs to be updated from their perspective.
Kathleen can move forward with what she needs to do.

-------------
## State Validation  (Do before Launch)
`Team Meeting July 16, 2020`  
**The form allows for a write in of a state but that might throw an error**  
Expects state or country, BGS wants two separate fields

Easiest way: Are you in US?
yes: free form for country to be passed to country field
no: proceed with drop downs fow state and country

We will need the 2 digit codes (ISO-3166 alpha 2) for all the BGS state and country codes

_Note/ Guiding principle_
- Action items:
  - Ask BGS - "What is the field level validation for city, county, state and country". Documentation speaks to this and we were able to confirm ourselves.  

**TL;DR - what does this mean?  what do we do next?**

## File Uploads  
`Meeting on 6/23/2020`  
**Description: need to establish to sides of the issue - FR and BE.  FE is looking for an endpoint to submit to in order to include the file in the payload submission as well as another to pick it up and send to eFolder via VBMS.**  
  
_Action Items_
- Ask in platform: 
  - It looks like there is a general endpoint (ClaimDocuments?), but perhaps it should be form specific?
  - There are two process here, attachements are sent to the eFolder via VBMS, and sent to a vnpTable for submission
  - How can we test locally?
- Ask Lihan perhaps?
- Do we need to make a form specific integration to get the attachment moving?

**TL;DR - At this point we need to find more information about how files are handled.**

## VA File Number  
`May 8, 2020`  
**A decision was made about how to handle the VA File Number and it's impact on the Veterans' ability to proceed into the Form 21-686c Dependent Claims application.**  
  
_Steve: "Since file number is a critical field for establishment of a claim, AND it tracks with SSN, AND SSN is often vulnerable to off-by-one errors, it's critical we try to derive the file number so we don't accidentally establish a claim for a different person."_
- There should be no user input of the VA file number. No UI for this first version.  
  - Research: where and how to get a hold of this number from the backend   
  - If the file number is not present in the API response, then the user is in an error state.  
  - The VA file number is required to submit   
- Next iteration may eventually show masked versions of the SSN and VA File Number
  
**TL;DR - We are going to run a check on this and if we are _not_ able to get it, we need to send the user to a phone number to ensure their VA file number is in place in the VA system of record via some error messaging (WIP):**

## Additional Pension Questions  
`May 5, 2020`  
**Some questions have come to light involving a Veterans Pension information.  These questions are:** 
When adding dependent, ask an additional (optional) question: "Did this dependent have income in the last 365 days?"

Ask a global (optional) question: "Did the household have a total income of less than $XXX in the last tax year?"
  
_This should be handled with care and context so that financial questions are not off-putting to the Veteran_
- Design the presentation of these questions in a way that conveys their intent and gives confidence to the Veteran about what they are answering and what it is for.
- These questions are in the current mockups, with callouts, but will not be implemented until after production.

**TL;DR - 2 new pension questions to be added.  Create a mockup for later implementation**

------------
## 674 in First Version
`Date decided`  
**The 674 is essentially a whole separate form but can fit nicely inside of the 686.  Because there are some aspects of the 674 that require some heavier lifting, we may not go into the first version with the 674 complete**  
  
_Note/ Guiding principle_
- Action item

**TL;DR - what does this mean?  what do we do next?**
------------

## Field Deltas 
`May 18, 2020`  
**The form presents a set of questions and possible answers but the backend in BGS may only accept a portion or a different set of them.**  

-E.g., we take suffix online but there is no place to fill it in the actual pdf.
  
_As much as possible we want the structured data to be representative of what is being presented._
- Ensure there is documentation on what these deltas are.

------------

## Tweaks to Questions  
`May 18, 2020`  

**Report Divorce - two radio buttons for reason marriage ended: Divorce and Annulment / Other.
Spouse Marriage History - three radio buttons for reason marriage ended: Divorce, Death, and Other.**
