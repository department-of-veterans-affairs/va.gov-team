# Potential Email Solutions (WIP)
`eBenefits Team | July 2020`

### [Background](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits/features/view-update-dependents/product-decisions.md#silent-failures)
Before launching, we have found that silent failures for 686 applicaiton submissions are sub-optimal and while other online forms have the same issue, we can do better for the Veteran.

### Problem Statememt
We need a solution for the Vetean to be clearly and explicitly communicated with respect to their application's status while in flight from submission before it gets taken in by an approving mechanic so that action can be taken and submission applications are not lost.

## Considerations
We are goign to want the Veterans email for this to work but we should not assume that what they enter in the form is legit as it could be mistyped and not verified.  IF possible, we shoudl strive to attain the veteran's email from their profile as that is most likely far more correct.  It also covers the notion that in the event that the person filling it out for someone else, the actual owner would be informed of action being taken on their behalf for whatever effect.

### Option 1
Communicate success and failure to the Veteran's email using GovDelivery.

First version:
For failures, it might simply be a note saying that something is wrong and that should look for their draft, or reapply.  This would be triggered from an exhaustion in job retries - After retrying `n` number of times, Sidekiq will call the `sidekiq_retries_exhausted` hook on a Worker if you've defined it.

For success, we can see pretty quickly that the payload has been sent.

**Steps for implementation and testing:**
1. Vets api: Create app/mailers class in mailer folder following this example: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/app/mailers/hca_submission_failure_mailer.rb
2. Add Veteran's email to `veteran_hash` in controller, see this example: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/pull/4515/files#diff-4b4a92bc85af3056adf6b351d25ef693R31
3. Define `sidekiq_retries_exhausted` in 686 job: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/pull/4515/files#diff-cd123f9cd41ecb581b570aa90c80050d
4. Fire mailer created in step 1 (assume we have access to veteran hash in the exhausted block) 
Example: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/app/models/health_care_application.rb#L164 
Another example: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/app/workers/evss/disability_compensation_form/submit_form8940.rb#L16 

### Option 2
Per the Messaging Team in #notifications-engine, we have spoken to Clarice, and hasve a meeting set to chat with Paras Shah to learn more about what email and texting optins they might have.
