# Overview
When the 686c is submitted, there are certain use cases that require additional documentation.  When uploading the attached supporting evidence to VBMS, there is a "document type" field that needs to be set. Some examples are marriage certificate, birth certificate, etc.  Currently, we allow the Veteran to upload attachments as supporting evidence, but we don't ask the Veteran to specify what type of evidence they are attaching.  

We need to determine the best path forward that will enable us to capture the document evidence type (please note that this is different than file type) so that we can use the appropriate document type code when uploading to VBMS.  Included below are some screenshots of how similar functionality currently exists within eBenefits and other forms on VA.gov.
