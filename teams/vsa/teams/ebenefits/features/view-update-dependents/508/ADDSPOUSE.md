## Out of scope issues that appear on axe / axe-coconut scans:
1. Heading levels should only increase by one
    * h4 in footer - `<h4 class="va-footer-linkgroup-title">Veteran programs and services</h4>`
    * location - `.va-footer-linkgroup:nth-child(1) > h4`
1. Elements must have sufficient color contrast
    * Multiple form elements trigger a color contrast warning. Since all fields use default form-system styles, this is outside the scope of this 508 check.
