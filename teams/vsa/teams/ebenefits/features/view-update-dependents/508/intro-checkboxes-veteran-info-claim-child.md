1. Scan with axe browser plugin  
- Heading levels should only increase by one, this can be H2 and made to look like H4.  Even thought its in the right order, it needs to be sequential.  
```HTML
<h4>Follow the steps below to apply for declare or remove a dependent.</h4>
```
Check "Prepare" and "When you apply,..." as they may be H5/6  

2. Scan with axe-coconut
