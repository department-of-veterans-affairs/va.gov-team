# Release Plan: View, Add or Modify Dependents (21-686c/674)

## Phase I: moderated production testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)

### Planning:
- Desired date range or test duration: June 3 - June 16 
- Desired number of users: 20
- How you'll recruit the right production test users: white list a number of known veterans 
- How you'll conduct the testing: invite them to fill out the page
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: Flipper

### Results:
- Number of users: x
- Number of bugs identified / fixed: x/x
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum

## Phase II: unmoderated production testing

### Planning:
- Desired date range: June 17 - June 30
- Desired number of unique users: 100
- How you'll make the product available in production while limiting the # of users who can find/access it: Flipper with monitoring (1% - 0%)
- "Success" criteria (by the numbers): Converting succesfful submissions, 400 and 500 errors less than 20%, contact center calls less than 5.

### Results:
- Number of unique users: x
- Actual results (per your "success criteria")
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum

More phases? Sure! If it makes sense for your product! Plan them out with the same structure as above.

## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
