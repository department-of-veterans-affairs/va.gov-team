# Research plan for user acceptability testing (UAT) for View Payment History / production environment
**VSA eBenefits Team | December 2020**

### Background
The View Payment History tool dispays a pair of tables that show a user's VA compensation & pension (C&P), and education (EDU) payments. The arrangement of these tables (Payments Made and Payments Returned) is similar to basic consumer bank and financial apps. Up to six payments will display at a time; tables will paginate if a user has seven or more payments or returned payments.

A user must be authenticated to LOA3 (identity verified) to access this feature.

### Goals
The goal of User Acceptance Testing (UAT) testing is to confirm the complete and accurate presentation of users' VA C&P payments, education payments, and any returned payments.

#### Key guiding questions
- Can users quickly and easily review their history of VA compensation and pension, and/or education payments/returned payments?
- Can users quickly and easily find a particular payment/returned payment within a date range using the pagination feature?

### Method
Veterans receiving C&P and/or EDU payments will be recruited and given access to the new VPH tool. We'll moderate UAT remotely using Zoom. Participants will review their payment history and attest to its completeness and accuracy. Remote observers may be in attendance.

Sessions are planned to take 15 to 30 minutes.

#### Success criteria

Users will:
- Review payments made; success: payments will be complete and accurate
- Find an older payment that does not appear on the first page of the table; success: user will locate an "older" payment
- Review returned payments; success: information will be complete and accurate

#### The process

- There will be a quick introduction to UAT
- The user will log-in to VA.gov using ID.me
- The participant will be guided to the View Payment History feature
- The user will review their payment history and confirm it's correct and up-to-date
- If there is more than one six payments, the participant will be asked to locate a payment from an older date (necessitating a review of other table "pages")
- If there are retuned payments, the user will be asked to confirm these are accurate and up-to-date
- There will be a quick Q/A and wrap-up 
- Overall success will be measured as 100% of participants confirming their information is complete and accurate

### Participants & recruiting
Participants will be recruited via Perigean. The study will require Veterans who receive C&P and/or EDU payments. Participants must be authenticated to LOA3 (identity verified), and need ID.me credentials to log in. 

Recruit for a **minimum of 4** fulfilled sessions using the following criteria:

#### Participant platforms
We'd like to split the participants into two groups: mobile and laptop/desktop so that we can get feedback regarding both platforms.

- Please target two participants each for mobile and desktop plaforms for a total of four paricipants

#### Must have for participants

- Do you receive either C&P or EDU payments from VA (pass = yes)
- Do you have an ID.me login (pass = yes)
- Are you LOA3 (identity verified) on VA.gov? (pass = yes)
   - This can be confirmed by having users sign into VA.gov with any of their credentials and having them go to the VA.gov profile. 

#### Good to have for participants

- At least one woman
- At least one person of color
- At least one participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
- At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Vets)
- At least one person that has a college degree (to include of officer Vets)
- At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area
- At least one person who lives in a major metropolitan area
- At least one person who will use a phone to login

#### Recruitment requirements

- Participants can use any device with a browser (desktop, laptop, tablet, phone)
- The participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session (including mobile)
- The participants know how to screenshare

#### eBenefits Team Availability

Please allow 30 minutes between sessions.
