## Intro
Good morning/afternoon and thank you for joining us today.

I have a few things I need to mention before we start:
- The session should take about 15 minutes, but you can stop any point--just let me know. 
- If something is confusing, or you run into an issue or problem, please let us know; we are constantly looking for ways to improve our features and tools
- In this call you'll be seeing your live VA payment information. The feature we're testing is just view-only--nothing will be added or changed during this session.

## Screening

OK, let's get started.

You'll be using a new feature we moved from eBenefits to VA.gov: View Payment History. I have a few questions to make sure this tool will work for you:
- I need to confirm: do you receive compensation & pension or education payments from VA?
  - If the user does not receive compensation & pension or education payments from VA, end the session.
- Can you confirm for me that you have an ID.me account? And do you know your username and password? 
  - If not: Are these easy to get? Could get you them?
  - If the user can not remember or retrieve their login credentials, end the session.
- Do you know if you are identity verified?
  - You may need to ID verify before we can continue.
  - If the user does not want to ID verify, or cannot find info required to ID verify, end the session.
- During this call, I'll be helping you review your VA payments; 
  - If not end the session.

Today we're going to observe you reviewing your VA payments. We're not recording this session, but we'll be seeing dates, bank names and dollar amounts; account numbers will be masked. So, can you confirm that you indeed would like to do this, and are comfortable walking through the tool with me?
- If not: Explain this is neccessary for testing. If they are still unwilling (e.g. because of personal info), end the call.

OK, the last questions are about your computer and browser.
- Can you tell me what type of computer you are using today?
  - We ask because sometimes the type of computer can affect your experience with the tools. Knowing which one you are using will help our developers make adjustments if needed.
- Can you tell me which web browser you are using? Are you OK using Chrome?

OK, please share your screen, and we'll get started.
