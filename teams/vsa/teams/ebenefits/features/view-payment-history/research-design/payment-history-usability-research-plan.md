# Research plan for usability testing for View Payment History
**VSA eBenefits Team | August 2020**

### Goals
We're moving the View Payment History feature (VPH) from eBenefits to VA.gov. Our primary goal is to maintain exisitng functionality of the VPH feature as we 'translate' it into the VA.gov system. We're conducting usability testing of the feature as developed in staging to determine if the new VPH is intuitive and functional for users needing to review their VA payment.

#### Background
In its current implementation, VPH is a pair of filtered tables that show VA Compensation & Pension, and Education payments made to quailifying Veterans. The arrangement of these tables (Payments Made and Payments Returned) is similar to basic consumer bank and financial apps. Preliminary research indicated that participants often look to their own banking apps to review VA payments rather than logging-in to eBenefits, but users generally found the current eBenefits VPH feature acceptable. Some wanted more advanced search and filting of data.

#### Research questions
- Where and how (what links/navigation) do participants expect to find their payment history?
- Do participants find the information in the VPH feature useful and complete?
- What, if any, other information do participants expect to see?
- What changes are needed to beter present the information?
- What changes would help viewing data in mobile formats (small viewports only)?

#### Hypotheses
During discovery, the users we talked to said they usually used their own bank apps to check VA payments, and they were satisfied with the desktop and mobile presentations. We did not talk to anyone without a bank checking account. The presentation of View Payment History was designed to align with commercial banking apps. 

Our hypothesis is that View Payment History will present most of the information Veterans expect in a generally accptaple manner. Some users will want more advanced search and filter options; some may want additional columns.

### Method
We will engage in moderated usability testing conducted remotely using Zoom. Remote testing is curently to only viable option, but the metod should yield acceptable observations on which to base findings. Participants who receive VA payments will be recruited using Perigean. These users will login to VA staging using test accounts and review the feature. The sessions will be recorded, and observers and notetakers may be in attendance.

### Participants and recruitment

Recruit for 5 fulfilled sessions using the following criteria:
