## Phase I: Moderated Production Testing
### Planning:
- Desired date range or test duration: **December 2020**  
- Desired number of users: **Between 4 and 7, but no more than 10**  
- How you'll recruit the right production test users:  **Whitelist a number of known veterans within Flipper** 
- How you'll conduct the testing: **Moderated**
  - **Invite them to view the page**
  - **Monitor available services**
  - **Gather feedback and address feedback**
  - **Move to unmoderated or % based release** 
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: **Flipper will manage access as the users login**

### Results:

- Number of bugs identified / fixed: x/x
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum

## Phase II: Move to Wider Release (Production)
### Planning:
- Desired date range: **December-January 2020**
- Desired number of unique users: **100 or 10%, whichever occurs first**
- How you'll make the product available in production while limiting the # of users who can find/access it: **Use Flipper with monitoring**
- "Success" criteria (by the numbers): 
Objective 1: Empower Veterans to update dependents immediately
Objective 2: Get Veterans the benefits they deserve in hours not months
  - **Succesful views => 10,**
  - **400 and 500 errors less than 5%, may be subject to change**
  - **Contact center calls less than 10% for errors,**

### Results:

## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 
1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
