# Executive Summary

## Abstract

## User Problem Statement

As a Veteran or Servicemember I need to understand and apply for CH31 benefits.

## Solution Goals

### User Goals

- **Veterans:** Apply for Veteran Readiness & Employment benefits at the VA.
- **Field:** Receive a higher volume qualified applicants 

### Business Goals

## Assumptions

- Product will submit form to VR&E CMS System via custom API

## Requirements and Constraints

- Application should be available for all users: UNAUTH, LOA1, and LOA3
- Excerpt from systems requirement doc: 
> In response to the receipt of a 28-1900, the system will display and check the following: Veteran or IDES (yes/no), service connected disability rating percentages and conditions (if 10% or more continue eligibility check); discharge other than dishonorable (continue eligibility check); served on or after September 16th 1940 (if yes to all four, Veteran is eligible to participate in an evaluation for chapter 31).

## Solution Approach

- Translate form to VA.gov, prefill logged in user info, submit to Central Mail. Current EBN functionality involves clicking a single button.
