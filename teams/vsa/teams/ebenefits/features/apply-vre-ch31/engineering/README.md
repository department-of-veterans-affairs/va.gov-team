# Notes for Integration with VRE API

**Establishing what we need**

- Gain access to VRE develeoper: Fatjon K.
- The `vets-api` codebase needs to be on the VA network to work with the VRE API/endpoint(s): config proxies to access VRE API
- ATO conversation, ESI doc, MOU

**Next Steps**

- Set up the CH31 model, submit draft PR
  - Until sercret manager issue/ proxy config for submission is in place, this will be a draft PR
- Adjust testing environment while testing against external urls
- Test with Fatjon K. and adjust code and urls accordingly as we gain access
