# VOX Changes
✔ - ready for implementation  
🙋‍♂️ - needs further discussion  
❌ - unable to move forward  

### Page 1
  - **Comment 1:** at end of first sentence "to obtain suitable employment or to live independently."  
JW:✔  
JA:    
  - **Comment 2:** state "if you're eligible to apply." at the end of first sentence, instead of "if you're eligible for VR&E"  
JW:✔   
JA:    
### Page 2
  - **Comment 1:** Replace "you probably qualify for benefits, with "you probably qualify to apply for VR&E benefits"  
JW:✔   
JA:   
  - **Comment 2:** Is there another word that could be used in lieu of GET? for example - obtain, acquire..etc...

### Page 3
  - **Comment 1:** `Nothing noted`  
JW:🙋‍♂️   
JA:    
  - **Comment 2:** add the word "may"  between "benefits" and "include:"  
JW:✔  
JA:  
  - **Comment 3:** These bullets are not appropriate.  We would suggest instead: *Training to prepare for a job, * Professional or vocational counseling and training, *Employment  assistance   
JW:✔  
JA:  
  - **Comment 4:** I think we should add:  Generally, if you are entitled to both VR&E services and eligible for Education benefits, using VR&E benefits might be more beneficial.  You should speak to a VRC before deciding.  
JW:🙋‍♂️ Does this add more complexity? How do they get a hold of a VRC and when?  Should that be done before, instead of or after completing this form?  
JA:   
  - **Comment 5:** `Nothing noted`   
JW:🙋‍♂️ Is this intended?   
JA:    
  - **Comment 6:** Instead of the example (which may not be correct)  state, If you are eligible for VR&E and another VA education benefit, speak with your Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) to determine the best fit for you.     
JW:🙋‍♂️ Same as Comment 4 above - lets get clarity on these   
JA:    
  - **Comment 7:** Re write the sentences starting with "As a Veteran or ..." to state "As a Veteran released from active duty before 1/1/2013, you're eligible for VR&E benefits and services within a 12 year period. In addition, if you are a Veteran or Service member with a Release from Active Duty date on or after January 1, 2013 there is no eligibility termination date."  
JW:✔   
JA:   
### Page 4
  - **Comment 1:** The rest of this sentence should be the next bullet and it should start with "If you are determined to be entitled to benefits, you VRC will tell you about next steps."  
JW:✔   
JA: 
  - **Comment 2:** There should be one additional bullet "If it is determined you are not entitled to VR&E benefits, your VRC will provide you with additional resources that may assist you.
