### Page 1
  - **Comment 1:** at end of first sentence "to obtain suitable employment or to live independently."  
JW:✔  
JA: Reconciled with BP revisions and plain language.  
  - **Comment 2:** state "if you're eligible to apply." at the end of first sentence, instead of "if you're eligible for VR&E"  
JW:✔   
JA: Reconciled with BP revisions and plain language.   
BP: It's a little weird to talk about being eligible to apply rather than being eligible for the program. I'd like to revisit this either before or after launch. Maybe float something even shorter, like: First, answer a few questions below to find out if you may be eligible.
### Page 2
  - **Comment 1:** Replace "you probably qualify for benefits, with "you probably qualify to apply for VR&E benefits"  
JW:✔   
JA: Reconciled with BP revisions and plain language.
  - **Comment 2:** Is there another word that could be used in lieu of GET? for example - obtain, acquire..etc...  
JW:❌ "Get" is approved friendly tone on VA.gov.  What does changing this word achieve in the forms objectives?   
JA: Went with "Receive"
BP: Agree with this solution!
  - **Comment 3:** no hyphen for independent living  
JW:✔  
JA:✔
### Page 3
  - **Comment 1:** `Nothing noted, misplaced comment note`  
JW:✔    
JA:✔  
  - **Comment 2:** add the word "may"  between "benefits" and "include:"  
JW:✔  
JA:✔ There were subsequent revisions to the orientation module, so line says, "These may include:"  
  - **Comment 3:** These bullets are not appropriate.  We would suggest instead: *Training to prepare for a job, * Professional or vocational counseling and training, *Employment  assistance   
JW:✔  
JA:✔  
  - **Comment 4:** I think we should add:  Generally, if you are entitled to both VR&E services and eligible for Education benefits, using VR&E benefits might be more beneficial.  You should speak to a VRC before deciding.  
JW:🙋‍♂️ Does this add more complexity? How do they get a hold of a VRC and when?  Should that be done before, instead of or after completing this form?  
JA: The LOB re-write is confusing here... Will re-write.
BP: Should probably be something like this (not sure if the part about using VR&E first is the way to say it...please ck with SME): If you're entitled to VR&E services and also eligible for education benefits, in most cases you'll want to use VR&E services first. We encourage you to talk with a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) about this to make sure you get the most out of your benefits.
  - **Comment 5:** `Nothing noted, misplaced comment note`  
JW:✔    
JA:✔    
  - **Comment 6:** Instead of the example (which may not be correct)  state, If you are eligible for VR&E and another VA education benefit, speak with your Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) to determine the best fit for you.     
JW:🙋‍♂️ Same as Comment 4 above - lets get clarity on these   
JA:    
  - **Comment 7:** Re write the sentences starting with "As a Veteran or ..." to state "As a Veteran released from active duty before 1/1/2013, you're eligible for VR&E benefits and services within a 12 year period. In addition, if you are a Veteran or Service member with a Release from Active Duty date on or after January 1, 2013 there is no eligibility termination date."  
JW:✔   
JA: Had to re-work a bit
BP: Can you show me the rewrite? Or something like this would work (we don't use "released" in our copy): As a Veteran, if you separated from active duty before January 1, 2013, you're eligible for VR&E benefits and services within a 12-year period. And if you're a Veteran or service member who separated from active duty on or after January 1, 2013, there's no end date for your eligibility.  
### Page 4
  - **Comment 1:** The rest of this sentence should be the next bullet and it should start with "If you are determined to be entitled to benefits, you VRC will tell you about next steps."  
JW:✔   
JA: What's there is more clear and succinct: "Your VRC will give you an entitlement determination and tell you about next steps"
BP: If they are wedded to this approach, it could be: If your VRC determines that you're entitled to benefits, they'll tell you about your next steps. (If you're not entitled to benefits, they'll give you some resources that may help you.)
  - **Comment 2:** There should be one additional bullet "If it is determined you are not entitled to VR&E benefits, your VRC will provide you with additional resources that may assist you.   
JW:✔   
JA:❌ No, left this one out--muddies the waters 
BP: Agree. See above where I added the gist of this "not entitled" language in parentheses.
  - **Comment 3:** remove hyphen  
JW:✔   
JA:✔    
  - **Comment 4:** first bullet under Services should end with the work services -- in other words delete "for up to 18 months"  
JW:✔   
JA:✔ 
  - **Comment 5:** rewrite these bullets under completion to state: *You found and kept a suitable job *You are able to live more independently  
JW:✔   
JA:❌ No, it unneccessarily changes verb tense
BP: Agree.
  - **Comment 6:** delete the meet monthly bullet  
JW:✔    
JA:✔    
### Page 5
`No comments`
### Page 6
  - **Comment 1:** restate and say "This track is for claimants who served on active duty or in the National Guard and are now returning to their former job."  
JW:✔   
JA:❌ No, kept what was there--more nicely stated 
BP: It also would change the voice from addressing the Veteran more personably in second person (you) to third person (impersonable and also not our voice). Who wants to be known as a "claimant"?? Thank you, JA.
### Page 7
  - **Comment 1:** Instead of type of job you want, state "to be competitive in the labor market in a suitable occupation." suggest removing for the type of job you want.  
JW:✔   
JA:❌ No, need the plain language   
BP: Agree.
  - **Comment 2:** Remove the "find short-term" and  "get money" sentences (bullets)  
JW:✔   
JA:✔   
  - **Comment 3:** Instead if "Connect with..." state "Participate in monthly post-employment follow-up discussions"  
JW:❌ "Connect with..." is approved friendly tone on VA.gov.  What does changing this word achieve in the forms objectives?     
JA:❌ No, stayed with plain language
BP: Agree.
