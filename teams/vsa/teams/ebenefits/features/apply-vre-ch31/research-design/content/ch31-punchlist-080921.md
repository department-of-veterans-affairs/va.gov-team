## Introduction screen
- [ ] **Confirm:** styling of info-box (Note: Since you’re signed in to your account...); should it have the info icon and different spacing?
- [ ] Change green button text to: "Apply for Veteran Readiness and Employment"
- [ ] **Confirm:** Should "If you're not sure this is the right form, you can go back and answer the questions again," link be included?
- [ ] Change "To apply by mail" to H2
- [ ] **Confirm** Formatting/spacing is off for "Department of Veterans Affairs" address block; match prototype

### Subway map
- [ ] Change first sentence under (1) Prepare to: "When you apply, be sure to have these on hand:"
- [ ] **Confirm:** Change "Prepare, Apply, VA review..". headers to H3 (20px) 
- [ ] Lower-case the "R" in "Review"

## Wizard
- [ ] Intro (Wizard state) copy is different from both mocks and prototype; use content from XD Orientation mocks
- [ ] Orientation shows when “Neither” option is selected; the user needs to be a Veteran or service member to continue
- [ ] 2A. Other “no” responses also reveal the Orientation module; should we encourage “No” respondents to continue?
- [ ] Orientation continues to show when user backs-up to change response.
- [ ] Padding/margin issues throughout; refer to mocks
- [ ] Card is oddly formatted with action link; refer to mocks
- [ ] 5A. Should “Apply online…” text say “Apply fo Veterans…” like the second action link?
- [ ] Where did “Slide” numbers come from?
- [ ] “Orientation” sits on top of each panel… 
- [ ] Date styling on slide 2
- [ ] Lower-case the “T” on slides 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (Be sure of sentence case throughout)
- [ ] Agree that there should be a “done” panel/slide
- [ ] Cap “Only if different…”?
- [ ] Address block differences? “Street” vs. “Street address”; state/province/region?
- [ ] “Required” dropped to next line on moving question
- [ ] Really big text box for 1 two-digit number on years of education question

## Form
