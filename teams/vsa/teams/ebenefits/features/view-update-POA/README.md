# Executive Summary

## Abstract

TBD

## User Problem Statement

TBD

## Solution Goals

### User Goals

- **Veterans:** Review and update information about my representative. Practically: View my current representative/ POA, and submit a valid form 21-22 and/or 21-22a from start to finish online at VA.gov.

### Business Goals

- Needs discovery

## Assumptions

- Product will use existing prefill integrations to pre-populate known information
- Product will use BGS or BIP endpoints as EVSS is being deprecated
- More as per discovery

## Requirements and Constraints

- A logged in LOA3-proofed Veteran should be able to submit a 21-22 or 21-22a.
- Is it necessary that the forms be PDFed and uploaded to eFolder? Need research.
- TODO: Add more

## Solution Approach
