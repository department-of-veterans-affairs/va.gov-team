## Research Goals
The goal of this research is to understand user comprehension of the existing Power of Attorney Feature and user Payment History practices in eBenefits, as part of the digital eBenefits migration to the VA.gov website. This includes:
### Power of Attorney Feature:
- What are the Veterans expectations and pain points while using the feature?
- Assess the Veterans’ level of comprehension of the feature.
- Do Veterans differentiate the search feature from the form?
- Determine Veterans’ understanding of the role the form plays in the appeals process.
- Does legal language in the feature prevent Veterans from successfully completing steps?
- How did Veterans navigate to the Power of Attorney feature from the VA.gov homepage?

### Payment History Practices:
- What information in the Payment Table would the Veteran like to see displayed?
- What Payment History features are Veterans expecting?
- How does the Veteran confirm a payment from the VA?
- How do Veterans navigate to the Payment History feature from the VA.gov homepage?</br>

Prior to the research, we hypothesized that:
Power of Attorney Feature:
- Veterans will easily navigate through the feature.
- Veterans will efficiently locate, find, and select their representative in the feature.
- Veterans will differentiate the search feature from the form.
- Veterans will understand that their rights have been legally “handed over.”
Payment History Practices:
- Veterans will expect search features to locate a particular payment or a period of payments.
- The Veteran will want to only view the last 5-10 payments/returns in the Payment Table.

## Research Methodology
We used GoToMeetings to conduct remote directed interviews regarding the Power of Attorney feature and user Payment History practices in eBenefits, along with two wayfinding tasks on the VA.gov website. We presented desktop view screens of the Power of Attorney feature and the Payment History, while a moderator asked questions from a conversation guide.  We also displayed the VA.gov homepage and asked the participant to navigate to the Power of Attorney and Payment History pages.

- After pressing the ‘submit’ button, what does the Veteran anticipate the next steps will be?
- What other tools and sites did the Veteran employ to fill out the form?
- Why did the Veteran decide to retain a representative?
- What features are utilized by the Veterans when searching for a representative?
### Payment History Practices:

## Details of Findings
### Power of Attorney Detailed Findings
**1. Each Veteran preferred completing the Power of Attorney form with their chosen representative present.**
Every participant did not want to complete the appeals process alone. 9 out of 10 participants felt uncomfortable completing the form without their representative. Participants sought the representative's knowledge and experience to help guide them. All Veteran's representative completed the Power of Attorney Form for them.
> - "I didn't have any idea what I was doing." </br>
> - "Are they responsive to questions because when you file a claim you get the paperwork it can be hard to understand." </br>
> - "I would want my representative available to me for a quick question." </br>
> - "I dont know I would call my guy (represenative)."</br>
> - "Just because of my disabilities when I read things sometimes I cannot understand it." </br>
> - "I did want to Go it alone." </br>
 
**2. Veterans found the legal instructions confusing and unhelpful. They would prefer a Plain English summary to the legal text.**
The legal language caused the veterans to become hesitant about how to complete the steps.  The veterans expressed their hesitation when in the Privacy Act, the Limitation of Consent, and the Authorization of Address Change steps.   They felt the legal language limited their ability to understand the instructions clearly.  A large amount of legal text resulted in veterans not reading the page.
> - "It is easier if it is simple and to the point."</br>
> - "My opinion I like the simple to the point than once you get into it than explain it more."</br>
> - "I guess I scan it but never read it because it seems like you would need a lawyer to talk through it."</br>
> - "I know the privacy act stuff is required but most people will not read it and just move on."</br>
> - "Your kind of just want to skip over it."</br>
> - "Like a lot of stuff on here it is kind of long. If you take the time to read."</br>
> - "Will not read it so if you summarize it and highlight the important points people will read it."</br>
 
**3. The form's structure confused the veterans.**
Most Veterans could compartmentalize each step but did not understand the order of steps or why certain information was being requested.  Veterans indicated it would be beneficial to have an introduction page explain the form. Veterans would prefer to see the search feature and their personal information before the Privacy Act. Were as the Limited Consent and Authorization of Address Change, were seen as relevant to the process.
> - “Having the search for the representative first may be helpful."</br>
> - "Had someone else fill these out "because I don't want to make any mistakes."</br>
> - "Did not like the unstructured presentation." </br>
> - "This is more complicated because it is what you can or cannot do. This is deeper into personal information." </br>
> - "They(Attorneys office) will just fill out the form." </br> 
> - "I don’t know I would call my rep." </br>
 
 Other steps like the VA File Number, the Insurance Information, and Military Service seemed only to be confusing the Veterans. 
 Most Veterans did know their VA Number but stated that other veterans may not know it. Some veterans were unclear as to what it represented.
> - "It was the draft numbers."</br>
> - "It is your SSN."</br>
> - "I would call my VSO to ask if they know what the claim number is since I would not know what it is."</br> 
> - "This is the number that is assigned when initially filing for a claim."</br>
> - "I would have to look at my paper work."</br>

**4.Veterans felt the search feature lacked key decision information.** 
Veterans thought the search feature was a vetting tool supposed to selecting a representative. The information requested by the veterans would help a veteran better determine if the representative meets their qualifications as opposed to locating a specific veteran from the list. 
Most veterans wanted the table to display:
- Distance & location of the representatives from their home
> - "Vietnam veteran they may want someone within the same area to assist."</br>
> - "allow you to have someone close by."</br>

- The representative's name
> - "I would not choose this one becuase it does not have a name."</br>
> - "I would want to know the name I was unhappy with the last person at the office and I would want to know if that was the same person."</br>

- Gender of the representative
> - "Women vs. Men. Some women do not want to deal with guys. We do not have enough VSOs that are women either."</br>

- The amount of claims won
> - "How familiar they were with the appeals process."</br>
> - "by listing the success rate of the organizations."</br>

- The representatives specialty
> - "Was looking for qualifications or specialties."</br>
> - "Found info lacking; wanted specialties."</br>
> - "Each VSO has a specialty and a lot of women have MST."</br>
> - "bullet points of their specialty."</br>

- A rating system for the representative
> - "Maybe their rating system."</br>
> - "how successfully they are at doing this."</br>

- Representative’s availability 
> - "I would ask there hours."</br>
 
**5. Veterans felt the VA File Number, the Confirmation of Representative and Military Services steps are redundant.**
Veterans indicated some redundancy in the form. The form pre-populates the VA File Number on the Personal Information screen and the Military Service step only confirming personal information.  The Confirm Representative step was viewed as helpful, but unnecessary because the veteran picked the representative in the previous step.  The ‘Error/Warning’ message confused the Veterans.  Veterans were looking for a link to the problem or more context.
> - "Service numbers it is redundant because you already put your ssn."</br>
> - "Yeah see it (VA File NUmber) there (Confirm Personal Information step.)"</br>
> - "No but I do not understand why they need to understand which branch you were in."</br>
> - "I think it is a pointless question."</br>
> - "Why do I need my insurance here at this step. Unless they needed it for some reason I would delete it and skip over this step."</br> 
> - "It(Military Service step) seems very redundant"</br>
> - "If it could be shorter that would be good."</br> 
> - "I would shorten it a bit, there is too much information people will not read."</br>

**6. No Veteran completed the Insurance Number step. Participants felt this step  lacked instructions, and all participants questioned its relevance.**
All veterans were uncertain about what information to provide. There is little to no context about what number is being requested. Leaving all Veterans wondering what was the correct number to provide. Veterans also commented that their representatives did not ask for this information.
> - "Do I put my SSN, Medicaid number or supplemental insurance number. It is not clear which one they want."</br>
> - "Needs clarification as to what number
> - "What do they need my insurance number for and what kind of insurance. It does not specify. 
> - "I did not know we put in an insurance number."</br> 
> - "No, insurance is not part of the equation when you speak to a VSO."</br> 
> - "No because the hospital and DVA stuff, even on 21-022 it does not ask the insurance stuff and the VSO do not need the insurance."</br> 

**7. Veterans found it challenging to navigate to the Power of Attorney feature.**
1 out of 10 Veterans was able to locate the Power of Attorney form from the VA.gov homepage. The veterans used three navigational paths: the search feature, the hub links, and the menu item ‘VA benefits and health care.’ The Veterans felt overwhelmed by the dense content on the VA.gov's pages. The search terms that the Veteran's used,such as 'Power of Attorney', 'Power of Attorney form,' & 'representative' turned out to produce results that were too broad, burying any relevant search results.  the results. The hub links within the 'Disability' and 'Records' divs resonated with veterans. (provide an example or clarify for people with less context available?). They associated a claim with 'Disability' and saw the form as a legal document and paired it with 'Records.' 
> - "This is overwhelming I would be stuck at this point."</br> 

- Searching
> - "Looking for Search, type in Power of Attorney."</br>
> - "I would click on search and place Power of Attorney."</br>
> - "I can search for the key word representative."</br>

- Hub Links
> - "Looked for POA in Disability section."</br>
> - "Looked in Claim Status."</br>

- Menu
> - "Click on VA benefits and Health Care, click on Diablitly. I though it would be under Manage your benefits becuase I have already got my benefits."</br>
> - "I would still go to disability first."</br>

### Payment History Detailed Finding
**1. Veterans did not use the eBenefit's Payment History feature. They preferred to manage payments through their bank.**
9 out of 10 Veterans validate VA payment from their bank account.  One veteran stated they do not check their payments.
> - "Did not use View Payment feature."</br>
> - "I don’t go there often."</br>


**2. Veterans used other resources, phone and VA statements to resolve payment discrepancy.**
Veterans stated they are familiar with eBenefits but preferred calling the VA to resolve payment issues. Veterans preferred mailed VA statements to confirm payments than eBenefits. (grammar. Rewrite this sentence.)
> - "I call the VA directly and let them have it. I have had no problems."</br>
> - "I would call Janes office."</br>


**3. The Payment History table features and layout met the Veteran’s expectations, with the addition of an introductory statement, linking claims to payments, the Veteran's bank information, and searching by a date range.**
All Veterans were satisfied with the current Payment History feature. They positively commented about the sort and filter features and liked that the ledger was in chronological order with the more recent payment at the top. Some of the Veterans asked for the following information to be displayed on the Payment History page: Claim Number associated with the payment, the Veteran’s banking institution on record, and an alert indicating initial VA payment approval. 
> - "I think this works well."</br>
> - "I think this is actually good, it provides information for you to see and you can total it up and it is all in one place."</br> 
> - "Have a query for the date for the newest to oldest."</br>  
> - "You would be able to see reimbursement and things like that. It tells you want it is and if it is mailed."</br> 

**4. All Veterans were able to navigate to the Payment History page.**
All  participants quickly scanned and located the Payment History page.  Veterans understood the VA.gov website's terminology and found the Payment History page.  The veterans used three navigational paths: the search feature, the hub links, and the menu VA benefits and healthcare. 

The veteran's key search term, 'Payment History,' was at the top of the result, which Veterans located quickly. The Hub Links within 'Disability' resonated with veterans. The second link, 'View your Payment History,' was clearly labeled. They associated a claim's payments with 'Disability.'  Other Veterans migrated to the menu item 'VA benefits and health care' and found the 'View your Payment History' links in both submenus Pension and Disability.
> - "The search up at the top to the payment history to see what it would give me."</br> 
> - "I would click on the first one."</br> 
> - "Scroll down and Diabilities. Right there."</br>

## Additional Findings
**1.  Many Participants request that Military Sexual Trauma (MST) be one of the items added to the Power of Attorney's limited Consent step.  This was a point brought up by several Veterans. Currently, it is not an option to limit this information. MST effects were not limited to the step but also was a factor in who the Veteran picked as a representative. The Veterans we spoke in favor of a similar gender representative because it increased their comfort level.  
**2. The steps in the Power of Attorney had two main themes. The Veterans keep shifting between the two themes as they proceed through the feature.  
- The first was confirming the Veteran's information found in steps 2, 3, 6, and 7
- The second was information pertaining to the representative found in steps 1, 4, 5, 8, and 9
