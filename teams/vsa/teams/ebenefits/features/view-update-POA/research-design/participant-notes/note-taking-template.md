## Intro - 5 minutes
My name is Nick, and thank you for joining us today.  Before we go any further, I'd like to make you aware that I have my colleagues on the line who will be observing and taking notes.  Today, we're going to walk through the Power of Attorney form and the Payment History feature on the VA's eBenefits website. 

Before we begin, there are a few things I wanted to mention:

- **This entire session should take about an hour.** 
- **Our intention** is to modernize and enhance two features found on eBenefits website because we are building these features on VA.gov. With your help, we would like to incorporate Veterans' feedback about how to improve the features.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinion.** 
- **"You'll be viewing a test environment of eBenefits** for this study. 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**  
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 
    - **If you're okay with me recording, once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session again.** I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?"**
