- [ ] Verify prototype states are reset

  

## Intro - 5 minutes 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is `Candy Clark` and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about using representatives to assist the claims process.  

Before we start, a few things I want to mention: 

- **This entire session should take about [30 minutes].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. 

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. 

- **You'll be interacting with a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**  

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.  

    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**  

  

*Start recording.* 

  

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?  

  

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes 

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few introduction questions. 

- What is your service background?

    - [If they indicate that they had a representative] How did you find your representative? 
 

## First Task: Wayfinding - < 5 minutes 

- Please share your screen with us. 

- Now go to va.gov 

- For our first task, I’d like for you to imagine that you are interested in finding someone to help you with you apply for disability compensation. Where would you look for someone? 

  

### Things to watch for:

    - Do they use search? 
    - Do they look under myVA? 


## Second Task: Finding a representative - 5-10 minutes
