# Questions for Lighthouse Team on OGC Data

## General
- What OGC data is available?
- How can we access it?

## View
- Depending on what the data looks like when it comes back?
  - Organization (VSO)
    - Org Name
    - Contact info
  - Individual
    - Org name
    - Individual name
    - Contact name

## Search
- Is there an existing set of search endpoints?
- Or can they set something up for us vs access directly accessing data
  - What does the data look like
  - What parameters would search endpoints have?

## Testing
- Starting here: https://developer.va.gov/explore/benefits/docs/claims?version=current
- We see the POA calls towards the bottom and are attempting to use curl to see if we can get some back and forth
