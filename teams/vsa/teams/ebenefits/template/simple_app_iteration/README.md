# "Complex Application" Product Template (1 iteration)
If the application we are building allows the user to do more than one main thing then we classify it as a "complex application". These complex applications are generally built in iterations, not all at once, so this product template aproximates what needs to be done in 1 iteration cycle.  Not all of the tickets required for a complex application are included here but all of the tickets here are required.
