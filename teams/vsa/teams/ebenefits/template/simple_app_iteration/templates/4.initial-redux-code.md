# Goal
We use Redux to manage the state of our apps across VA.gov and since the [App Name] will use data from any of various sources we need to build out the redux code to support that. This initial build of the Redux code does not have to use live data if none is available yet, we can hard code mock data for the time being if needed.

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up Action(s) file for [App Name]
- [ ] Set up Reducer(s) file for [App Name]
- [ ] Submit a PR for review

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] The [App Name] now uses Redux to mange state
- [ ] A PR has been submitted for review
