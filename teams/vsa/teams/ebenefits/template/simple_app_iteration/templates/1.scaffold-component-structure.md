## Goal
In order to begin building the [App Name] according to the mockups we need to first scaffold out any components that will be needed. These scaffolds do not need to include any logic, as that will be added in separate tickets, but it should reflect the basic structure the app architecture will follow. For the [App Name] in particular we need to build/ modify the following components -

- [ ] Insert first component name here
- [ ] Insert second component name here

## Tasks
- [ ] **IF** this is an already existing app that is being iterated upon, discuss or set up flipper components to gate new functionality
- [ ] Build/ modify the components listed above to reflect the architecture of the requested app
- [ ] Submit a PR for review

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] The app arcitecture for the [App Name] has been built/ modified to reflect new functionality
- [ ] **IF** this is an already existing app, the new structure is hidden from users behind flipper
- [ ] A PR has been submitted for review
