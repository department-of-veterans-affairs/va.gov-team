# KPI Pre-Workshop Planning

## Product Line
- eBenefits

### North Star
- **Work with Veterans to design and deliver the best digital experience in the federal government.**  
Transform eBenefits products into personalized, guided experiences that help Veterans and the people in their networks get the benefits and services they deserve.  This will be done by transforming, migrating and optimizing critical features and functions from eBenefits to the VA.gov central location.  
_For more on these principles, see the [**eBenefits Charter**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits/charter.md)._


## Product
- eBenefits have several products in its portfolio most of which are tasked with migration out of `https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/homepage` and into the mainstream `https://www.va.gov/`.  
- Our first feature is Rated Disabilities, to be migrated from its current location onto a page that has a gateway link from a profile/dashboard page after the user logs in.  
_A list of [**priorities**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits/priorities.md) has been established and is being treated as a source for further roadmapping._

## High Level Objectives
One of the largest high-level objectives for the eBenefits Team is to get the resources out of the current more fragmented environment and move them into the main site of VA.gov.  This puts the resources put forth by the VA much more front and center to the Veteran, their dependents and caregivers.  If any of those products or features can be enhanced or optimized while being transformed, that will be taken into account as well.

- Discover, define landscape of development and design environments
- Establish framework of migration process
- Assess and validate improvements
- Communicate and collaborate with other teams as necessary  
_For more detail, see the current [**Sprint Objectives**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits/sprint-objectives.md)._

## Pain Points
- **Veterans:** Navigating across a fragmented site with multiple portals/locations can be confusing and ineffective  
  - Found content might not make sense
  - Action items or next steps might not seem clear
- **eBenefits Team:** We want to ensure that intent of the feature is clear to the Veteran  
  - We may deal with antiquated code
  - Team: Unknown stakeholders, who can we ask?
  - Team: Getting timing right when impacting other teams

## Desired Outcomes
- **Veterans:** As a Veteran with service connected disabilities, I want to quickly and easily apply and obtain as many benefits as possible.  
- **eBenefits Team:** Engagement with the specific product increases
  - More visibility, more conversion
  - More benefits are put into affect for the Veteran
  - Ensuring that we are able to establish the right metrics for each product we transfrom, and ask the question: what else can we improve while we migrate.

## Hypotheses
- By creating a framework for migration, we can more easily lift other items out of the eBenefits portfolio and move them into the VA.gov main site quicker and more effectively.
- We plan to incorporate as much 508 compliance into our migration process in order to alleviate and expedite the 508 review process.

## Measuring Success
- Ratio of current eBenefits users compared to users in the new location
  - Once the ratio is near 1:1, or some agreed upon threshold,  plans for sunsetting can be triggered
