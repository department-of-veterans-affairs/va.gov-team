### General Research
[User Flow Through Vets.gov, May 2019](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Disability/Declare%20Dependent%20686/Discovery/Meetings/Research/Current%20user%20flow%20through%20Vets.gov.md)

[Introduction & Technical Overview](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Disability/Declare%20Dependent%20686/Discovery/Meetings/686%20Kickoff%203-16-18.md)

### Usability Research / Testing
#### Session 1 April 2018
[Source Docs for Research Conducted April 2018](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/master/Products/Disability/Declare%20Dependent%20686/Design/Usability%20Research%20April%202018)

Usibility testing was conducted using static prototypes of the Vets.gov implementation of the 21-686c form. There is evidence of five participants. A Conversation Guide and verbatim notes exist but no formal Readout or Analysis document. There is an "Outstanding Questions" doc that does include findings regarding participant sentiment and usability.
#### Session 2 June 2018
[Source Docs for Research Conducted June 2018](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/master/Products/Disability/Declare%20Dependent%20686/Design/Usability%20Research%20June%202018)

In June 2018, follow-up usability testing was conducted using the 21-686c form deployed to Vets.gov staging. Conversation guides were created for Veteran and non-Veteran participants. There are notes for sessions with four participants. A Research Readout document presents several key findings regarding the usability of the 686 form in staging, as well a general sentiment about the dependents workflow.
