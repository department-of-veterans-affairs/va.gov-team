 Monday, October 7. 9am EST 

## **Warm up questions**

**Moderator**: Before we talk about the website, tell me about yourself? 

**Veteran**:I joined the service 1974 at the end of Vietnam, stayed here for 20 years and retired in 1994. Then retired from VA 2013. 18 years and 20 years new army. I work with kids in elementary school and of course i got a bunch of grandkids and granddaughters that we’re raising. I work with 1st graders and pre-K kids. The one school has special needs kids and the other has 1-2 in there. They’re a handful sometimes. 

## **Navigation**:

**Moderator**: Are you familiar with VA.gov?

**Veteran**: Yes

**Moderator**: Are you familiar with eBenefits website

**Veteran**: Been a little while since I’ve been on there

**Moderator**: Can you tell em a little bit on how you used it?

**Veteran**: Looking for stuff for my granddaughter and see if there was any benefits for her. When I adopted my granddaughter I had to add her as a dependent on VA

**Moderator**: What was the experience like?

**Veteran**: Pretty manageable. I had to download some documents. Not really any problems at all

**Moderator**: How often do you use the eBenefits site?

**Veteran**: I had to go through ebenefits to get batteries for my hearing aids. I haven’t done it in a while so my memory is fuzzy.

**Moderator**: Did someone tell you how to add your granddaughter as a dependent?

**Veteran**: I think I found out on my own and once I went online, it wasn’t a problem

**Moderator**: Did you type in a search bar or did you go through a link?

**Veteran**: I think it was an email, but I got it as a favorite on my computer so I go that way.

*[Moderator shares screen]*

**Moderator**: When you came here what did you to do add a dependent?

**Veteran**: I think I went to that section to that profile, that’s how I would have done it

**Moderator**: When you were on this page, did you click “Add now”? 

**Veteran**: If any issue at all, it was the download of the adoption documents

**Moderator**: Did you download them from this page?

**Veteran**: Yes, where it says “upload documents”

**Moderator**: Do you use any other tools or websites to manage benefits?

**Veteran**: I use MyHealthyVet but it’s a little different than VA

**Moderator**: What do you do on MyHealthyVet

**Veteran**: I talk to my primary care and I order my medications

## **Features**:

**Moderator**: Have you had a disability rating done?

**Veteran**: Yes

**Moderator**: Do you normally look up your disability rating?

**Veteran**: Nope, I have but it’s been so long. I’ve been broke down so long. *laughs*

**Moderator**: Have you ever visited this page (disabilities page)

**Veteran**: Yes I have

**Moderator**: Can you recall what you were doing on this page?

**Veteran**: Unless I needed a statement for some other purpose, I may have looked at it out of curiosity.

**Moderator**: Do you have any caretakers logging in for you or just you?

**Veteran**: Just me

**Moderator**: You mentioned you had to order batteries for your hearing aid. Do you know where on this page you would click to start process?

**Veteran**: I could have done another search

**Moderator**: How was the process? Difficult or easy?

**Veteran**: It was simple, once i logged in it was clear what batteries I needed. There’s the DS login you use that as well

**Moderator**: Can you think of any other reason you might use eBenefits?You mentioned adding dependents, ordering batteries…

**Veteran**: I think the only other thing would be education or a home loan guarantee. Home loan I think I did it a good while ago, and if I’m sure if I decided to move to another home or condominium, I’d use it. That’s about it.

## **Post-Interview** 

**Moderator**: What is your least favorite part about using eBenefits?

**Veteran**: Sometimes it seems redundant since you gotta keep putting stuff in. That’s just me being lazy. I can’t say I got any problems in it really. 

**Moderator**: What is your favorite part about using eBenefits?

**Veteran**: Because it’s easy to access and it’s very informative. I don’t think I have yet to find what I wanted. It’s never let me down.  

**Moderator**: Anything I should know that maybe I didn’t ask about?

**Veteran**: I can’t think of anything right off. No, I really can’t.
