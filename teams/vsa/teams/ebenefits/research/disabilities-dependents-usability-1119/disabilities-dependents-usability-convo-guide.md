# eBenefits Rated Disabilities/View Dependents Usability Conversation Guide, November 2019

### Setup
- Slack #feedback-backchannel will be used for real-time feedback from observers
- Attendee/Observer instructions, including instructions for #feedback-backchannel, will be sent out ahead of the sessions
- Sessions will be conducted remotely, setup will be tested 15 minutes prior to call-time
- [Associated Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits/research/disabilities-dependents-usability-1119/disabilities-dependents-usability-research-plan.md)

### Priorities
While it will be important to cover as much of this guide as possible during user sessions, time and circumstances may dictate that some questions be skipped. The most important aspect of this conversation guide is to orient the participant to what they will be seeing. This will mitigate in-session confusion, and help the participant provide more relevant feedback. The next priority is covering all, or most, of the Rated Disabilities screen. This page is in development, and has fully-designed screen layouts and alternate states. Much of the general feedback about the details of screen design and information display will be germane to all "tools page" layouts, and therefore View Disabilities as well.

## Introduction
Good morning/afternoon and thank you for joining us today. My name is Jim, and with me are a few colleagues who are helping-out by observing and taking notes. We are part of a team with the Department of Veterans Affairs that is moving some features of the old eBenefits site over to VA.gov. We're learning what veterans need to improve their online experience, and how we can make VA.gov more useful for you. Our particular focus is the Disability Benefits sections.

I have a few things I need to mention before we start:
- The session should take 30 to 45 minutes (confirm timeframe). But you can end it at any point--just let me know. We have quite a few things to cover, so to respect your time, I may break-in to move us to the next item.
- We are not promoting or selling any product or service.
- We're not testing you in any way--there are no right or wrong answers. We want to hear your candid thoughts about what we show you so that we can make improvements to VA.gov.
- Don't worry, I will not be offended by any opinions you express. Please be open about what you think.
- Do you have any questions for me before we start?
- With your permission, I will be recording this session. This will give a record to use for note-taking. The recording will be stored on a private drive and it will be deleted when we conclude our testing and note-taking. No personal identifying information will be transcribed.
- Do I have your permission to record this session?
- OK, now that I'm recording, do I have your permission to record this session?

## Warm-up
- Would you tell me a little bit about yourself? Your service experience, where you live, general experiences with the VA...
- Do you have a VA Disability Rating? Can you tell me, generally, about dependents you may have claimed?
- How often do you visit the eBenefits site? How about VA.gov; how often do you visit that site? 
- What differences do you notice between the two sites?
- Why do you visit these sites? (OR) What would you expect to find on them?
- What other sites do you regularly use to learn about or manage VA benefits?
- What computers or phones do you use to access VA (or other) sites? (If no mobile experience) Would you consider using a phone to access VA.gov?
- How has the VA communicated with you in the past? Which of these had links or referenced websites?
- And last, before we look at the test pages, if you wanted to see your VA disability rating, what would you do? This can be online or otherwise: website, phone call, in-person... 
- And how would you find or review your dependents benefits?
- (If no online path indicated) In what circumstances would you try to find this information online?

### Orientation to Screens
OK, now we'll take a look at the link I sent you. Can you share your screen? (If trouble with link) OK, now well look at the pages we're testing; I'll share my screen. Please let me know when you can see it.

What you see is a prototype--it's not a functioning website, it's mostly a non-working page design right now. But it will have a few working links that we'll click on as we go.

## Rated Disabilities
#### Landing Screen
You mentioned you'd try to find your VA disability rating by: (cite how participant responded). For the purpose of our session, we're going to skip straight to what you would see if you might have searched Google or the VA.gov site itself.
- Imagine you've searched for "Disability Rating" and come to this page; what do should do next?
- If you' didn't want to log in, but you had questions, what could you do to get answers? Are these acceptable options?
- If you wanted to see your individual Disability Rating(s), what could you do on this page?
- If you didn't want to log in just yet, what would you look at next? Is there a section or link for that?
#### Disability Rating Screen
- Now you've logged in; what the main purpose of this page is? Describe what's going on here. Whose information is displayed?
- What is the total combined rating displayed? Is this number more or less important that the individual ratings?
- How do you feel about how the individual disability ratings are shown? Is the information OK? Would you add or remove anything?
- What does service-connected mean? And how is that different from non-service-connected? From what you see, which individual disabilities are service-connected? 
- Can you see anything about how the VA determines this rating? What more would you like to know, if anything?
- If you felt this information was wrong, do you see any way to follow-up and address the problem?
- If you had a recent claim or appeal, what, if anything, does this page let you do?
- Now that you've logged-in and seen the disability rating, what would you expect to do next? Do you see anything on-screen that would let you do that?
- How would you return to the page you logged-in from?
#### Error States (If time permits.)
Let's go back to the screen you logged-in from. (Click breadcrumb link to advance)
If you would, click the green sign-in again. (User clicks to advance to Error 1)
- Seeing this screen, what do you think happened? What would you do next?

We have a few more of these; let's go back to the sign-in again, then click the green button once more. (Click breadcrumb link to advance, the user clicks to advance to Error 2)
- Now you see this page, what do you think happened, and what would you do next?

We have one more like this one. Back to the sign-in to click the green button. (Click breadcrumb link to advance, the user clicks to advance to Error 3)
- If you see this page, what do you think happened, and what would you do next? 

The final screen is a bit different. Back to the sign-in to click the green button. (Click breadcrumb link to advance, the user clicks to advance to Error 4)
- If you see this when you sign-in, what is this page showing? If you felt something was wrong here, what would you do?

## View Dependents
We're going to move on to the next set of screens--these are the last group. We'll cover a few of things we did in the last set; i's OK if you have different ideas about what you see with these.

#### Landing Screen
We talked a little about dependents and dependents benefits. We're going to say that you searched for dependent benefits and came to this screen. We're getting toward the end, so we won't talk much about this one.
- You've searched for "Dependents Benefits" and come to this page; if you want to see the dependents the VA has for you, what would you do next?
#### View Dependents Screen
- Once you've logged in; can you tell what the purpose of this page is? And whose information is displayed?
- How can you tell which dependents are on-award, and which are not?
- From what you see on this page, how would you remove a dependent? What would you expect to happen next?
- What if you wanted to change something about a dependent, how would you do that?
- Let's say you had a new dependent to claim, where on this screen can you do that? And what would you expect to see next?
- How do you feel about the way dependents are shown? Is the information OK? Would you add or remove anything?
- How do you feel about having dependents' information--especially those not on award--on VA.gov?
- What, if anything, would make this page more useful? What other ways would you expect to use dependents info?
- If you felt this information was wrong, do you see any way to follow-up and address the problem?
- And last, how would you return to the page you logged-in from?

## Wrap-up
Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here.
- Is there anything you'd like to add--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at--or VA.gov in general?
- Would you consider being involved in future follow-up sessions?

## Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to or team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
