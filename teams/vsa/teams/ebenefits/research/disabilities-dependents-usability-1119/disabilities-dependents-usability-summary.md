# eBenefits Rated Disabilities Research Summary
`James Adams, November 2019`

## Research Purpose & Goals
**Background:** In the course of design and engineering, the current functionality of both Rated Disabilities and View Dependents--basically viewing tabular or listed info from EVSS--was translated to VADS structural elements and components. These screen layouts use two new pieces that were developed to align with a new "tools page" arrangement: a right-hand "help" sidebar, and light grey boxes or "cards" to list formerly tabular information. Missing from this configuration is the left-hand navigational sidebar. 

Usability testing was conducted to validate the utility of the Rated Disabilities and View Dependents screen individually, and as "Tool Pages."

**Goals:** The overall goal of this research was to determine the user acceptability for the overall page layouts and the specific presentation on list data in a card format. Specifically, can users quickly identify the purpose of the page, scan and locate key information, and easily understand the visual hierarchy. Other goals included uncovering pain points, workflow breakdowns, user expectations, and potential future features.

## Methodology
- Usability sessions conducted via GoToMeeting; 30 minutes.
- 11 Veterans from varying backgrounds; most or all participants have a disability rating. Some have cognitive disabilities.
- Participants were prompted to find and perform various tasks using targeted questions from the conversation guide. Uers were allowed to explore screens and discuss their thoughts about the format and utility of what they saw. User actions were tracked against a "usability matrix." Veteran's were allowed to go "off-script" to recount relevant experiences.
#### Guiding Questions
- How often would users access Disabilities and Dependents screens?
- Can users quickly determine the purpose of the page? Can they find the TRD immediately? Are dependent details immediately apparent?
- Can users immediately find the relevant information on-screen?
- Is information displayed in a clear and understandable manner (text and components)?
- Are the "cards" and acceptable presentation of information?
- Is it clear in the View Dependents screens what the card buttons will do? 
- Given a particular user path, do users have a sense of where they are in the site?
- Is there a clear recourse for users if they see inaccurate or missing information on-screen?
- What other features do users expect when accessing disabilities and dependents information?

## High-Level Findings
Findings presented here are pending a formal analysis of research session transcripts and data collected. At this stage, a generalized overview is possible due to the strong concordance across user sessions.
#### Rated Disabilities
- Veterans are well-aware of the general use of VA disability ratings, including the service-connected and non-service-connected aspects. Most are well-versed in the process of applying for diability claims, and are aware of a "formula" VA uses to determine a total disability rating--but not neccessarily the details of how the formular works.
- Users found the presentation of total and individual diability ratings acceptable. Many participants had favorable impressions of how. and how much, infomation was displayed.
- Generally, Veterans were able to locate information and links quickly. Most considered the info presented appropriate in term of content and amount.
- Navigation back to the "landing-page" entry point was unclear to many participants. Many paticipants would opt for other navigational options or simply sign-out rather that return to the landing screen.
- The most prominent pain points seemed to center around login/authorization, and call center experiences.
- The most requested featured included real-time chat, drill-down details for specific disabilities, and specific information regarding the VA disability ratings formula.

#### View Dependents
- Few participants in test session had experience with applying to have dependents added to their disability claim.
- In spite of the lack of direct experience, most Veterans quickly understood the information presented, and could quickly locate particular content when prompted.
- The presentation of individual dependents in cards was generally acceptable to participants. many felt the content was clear and complete.
- Some users found the inclusion of dependents's SSN problematic. A few wanted additional information, such as addresses. Many Veterans expected VA to have their info, and information about their dependents "in the system" if they had provided it in the past (even if it was for different processes or applications).
- Most users expected the card buttons to link to a form, or to detailed information about indivdual dependents.
- Some participants questioned the reason for having dependents info (particularly dependents not on-award) on VA.gov. Chat and drill-down were mention as desirable features.

#### Tools Page Layout
- A few participants who remembered using the current eBenefits site had a favorable impression of the tools page presented--and the use of cards.
- Users generally did not notice the change in screen layouts moving from the left-hand-nav, content style of the landing pages, to the nav-less right-sidebar layout of tools page. 
- When users were asked to find content located in the tools screen's right-hand sidebar, they usually found it quickly. With no nav options presented in the left-hand column, users often said they would log out. Only a few participants were able to quickly identify the breadcrumbs as navigation.

## Other Notable Findings
#### Landing Pages
- Interestingly, when users where asked to find the entry point to view disabilities or dependents from their respective landing pages, they were oten drawn to the long list of links in the left-hand nav rather than the main content column.
- Some useres seemed to be initially overwhelmed by the amount of content they had to scan to find entry points. The top-most section of content was ofen read at length.
