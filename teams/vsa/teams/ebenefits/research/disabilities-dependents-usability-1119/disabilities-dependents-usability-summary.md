# eBenefits Rated Disabilities Research Summary
`James Adams, November 2019`

## Research Purpose & Goals
**Background:** In the course of design and engineering, the current functionality of both Rated Disabilities and View Dependents--basically viewing tabular or listed info from EVSS--was translated to VADS structural elements and components. These screen layouts use two new pieces that were developed to align with a new "tools page" arrangement: a right-hand "help" sidebar, and light grey boxes or "cards" to list formerly tabular information. Missing from this configuration is the left-hand navigational sidebar. 

Usability testing was conducted to validate the utility of the Rated Disabilities and View Dependents screen individually, and as "Tool Pages."

**Goals:** The overall goal of this research was to determine the user acceptability for the overall page layouts and the specific presentation on list data in a card format. Specifically, can users quickly identify the purpose of the page, scan and locate key information, and easily understand the visual hierarchy. Other goals included uncovering pain points, workflow breakdowns, user expectations, and potential future features.

## Methodology
- Usability sessions conducted via GoToMeeting; 30 minutes.
- 11 Veterans from varying backgrounds; most or all participants have a disability rating. Some have cognitive disabilities.
- Participants were prompted to find and perform various tasks using targeted questions from the conversation guide. Uers were allowed to explore screens and discuss their thoughts about the format and utility of what they saw. User actions were tracked against a "usability matrix." Veteran's were allowed to go "off-script" to recount relevant experiences.
#### Guiding Questions
- How often would users access Disabilities and Dependents screens?
- Can users quickly determine the purpose of the page? Can they find the TRD immediately? Are dependent details immediately apparent?
- Can users immediately find the relevant information on-screen?
- Is information displayed in a clear and understandable manner (text and components)?
- Are the "cards" and acceptable presentation of information?
- Is it clear in the View Dependents screens what the card buttons will do? 
- Given a particular user path, do users have a sense of where they are in the site?
- Is there a clear recourse for users if they see inaccurate or missing information on-screen?
- What other features do users expect when accessing disabilities and dependents information?
