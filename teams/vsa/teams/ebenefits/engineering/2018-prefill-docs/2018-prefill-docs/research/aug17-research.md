### There are 3 main things we want to test:

1. #### Have users go through the pension form. 

   Since pension participants are hard to recruit, we just recruited for any veterans to participate.

   One proposal is we provide the participant ahead of time a note stating his/her name, birthday, military history, spouses and children information, And see how they fill out the form based on the provided information.

2. #### Have users save an unfinished form

   Give the participants a scenario where they have to leave the application and come back to finish later.

   Can they find the option to save the form easily?

   Can they relocate the saved form easily?

3. #### Find out how users react to visual indication that we're saving the form along

   One proposal is have users go through the form without any visual indicator for a few screens. Then go through another few with the indicator and see their responses.
