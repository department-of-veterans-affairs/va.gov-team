# DiariesWebService

The Diaries Web Service is one of the BGS Awards Web Services.  This service is used to find the Diaries information. 

Methods
- `readHistoricalAndPendingDiaries`: read historical and pending diaries information
- `readDiaries`: read diaries information
- `updateDiaries`: update diaries information

<br>

## Estimation for Level of Effort
It will require approximately 10 PRs to implement the read and update diaries functionality in `vets-api`:
   1. `readDiaries` - BGS gem (this is the external gem used as a library that needs to be updated for each BGS service we want to call)
   2. `readDiaries` - lib code
   3. `readDiaries` - service code
   4. `updateDiaries` - BGS gem (this is the external gem used as a library that needs to be updated for each BGS service we want to call)
   5. `updateDiaries` - lib code
   6. `updateDiaries` - service code
   7. `updateDiaries` - endpoint/controller (this adds the route used by the front end and also includes swagger docs)
   8. PDF generation for [VA Form 21-0538](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-0538/) (Status of Dependents Questionnaire)
   9. PDF upload to VBMS or Central Mail
  10. Possible job (if required?)
  11. Additional endpoint/controller for `readDiaries` (if required?)
  
**Allowing approximately 3 business days for each PR, the estimated level of effort to develop this feature will take approximately 6-8 sprints.**

### Considerations
- Need to determine which Award Types need to be verified
  - `CPDC`, `CPDS`, `CPDP`, `CPL`(?)
  - How is this determined?  Who can provide a definitive answer?
- The beneficiary IDs can be obtained from the View Dependents service currently being used by VA.gov
- How to obtain the `awardType` is currently not known
- Is there a service that returns both Award Type and Beneficiary ID?  

\* ***Update:*** the current assumption is that we are only concerned with `CPL` award types and in that case, the `beneficiaryID` and `veteranID` will be the same.  `CPL` is compensation for a Veteran who is still alive, whereas `CPDC`, `CPDS`, and `CPDP` are for cases where the Veteran is no longer living.  Not to be confused with the `Death Comp` award types, which is assumed to be compensation in the event that a dependent passes away.

## readDiaries
Assuming the user is logged in, obtain the Veteran's participant ID and then:
1. Send a request to `readDiaries` with required fields `awardType`, `beneficiaryID`, `veteranID`
2. Filter list of diary entries on records where `diaryReasonType = 24` and `diaryLcStatusType = PEND`
   - What happens if more than one record with `diaryReasonType = 24`?
   - Is this possible?  
   \* ***Update:*** According to BGS, there should only be one record but in test data we have seen duplicates, so this still needs to be confirmed
   - Would the record with the latest date be used/unconcerned about records with earlier dates?  
3. Use some business logic to determine if dependency verification/update is required based on the `diaryDueDate` and the current date
5. If update/verification is required, create a diary object with the response info

<details>
<summary>Expand for example <b>readDiariesResponse</b></summary>
<br>

The `DiaryResponse` includes information about error level, dependency decisions, and diaries.  The diaries object contains a list of diary entries.  

ex. Diary:
``` diff XML
    <Diary>
        <awardDiaryID>60147</awardDiaryID>
        <awardEventID>523390</awardEventID>

        <beneficaryID>123456</beneficaryID>
        <diaryDueDate>2016-02-01T00:00:00-06:00</diaryDueDate>

## updateDiaries

The following is the list of fields that need to be sent as the `DiaryInput` when updating a diary entry:
<details>
   <summary>Expand for example <b>DiaryInput</b> in <b>updateDiaries</b></summary>
<br>

    AwardKeyInput
        awardType
        beneficiaryID
        veteranID
    <!--Zero or more repetitions:-->
    DiaryInput
        awardDiaryID
        awardEventID
        awardType
        beneficaryID
        diaryDueDate
        diaryLcStatusType
        diaryLcStatusTypeDescription
        * diaryObsoleteIndicator
        diaryReasonType
        diaryReasonTypeDescription
        * evrStatusType
        * fileNumber
        firstNm
        lastName
        * middleName
        modifiedAction
        modifiedBy
        modifiedDate
        modifiedLocation
        modifiedProcess
        payeeType
        ptcpntDiaryID
        * remarksText
        * salutation
        statusDate
        * suffix
        veteranID

</details>

1. For the record that contains `diaryReasonType = 24` and `diaryLcStatusType = PEND`, get the diary object that was created from the `readDiaries` response
2. Update `diaryDueDate` to the appropriate next date (1 year interval?)
   - Are there any other fields that need to be updated?
   - What about fields not in the diary response that are part of the update diary input (marked with an asterisk in the list above)?
   - The time period/one year interval could be set as a variable rather than hard-coded in the event that the interval changes
3. Send ALL records back with the updated diary record (including records that were not modified, along with the newly updated diary record)
