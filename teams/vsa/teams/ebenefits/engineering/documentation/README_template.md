This is a template that can be used to create a well written and useful README.md file for your team's app. This file is critical in getting new engineers up to speed or can be provided to outside teams to get them up to speed on how your app works as well as some details about the code

an example of how to fill this out can be seen [here]()


App Name:
URL for app:
Active engineers:
Form ID (if different from app name):

# Background
> Put a short description of why this app exists from the Veteran's perspective. What do they use it for? How often do they need to use it? This description does not need to be long or complicated, just get the basics across.

## How the app works for the user
> Put a medium detailed walkthrough of how the user walks through your app. What paths do they take through it? What do they do in those paths? This description should not touch on code specifics yet. Keep this description relatively high level, someone non-technical should be able to read this section.

## Running the app
> This is for a detailed set of steps to run the application on a local machine. Be sure to call out any interesting things like specific authentication needed or gotchas.

<details>
  <summary>Mocking the application</summary>
  
  > Put detailed instructions for how to mock the data for the app on a local machine. Include all the code snippets needed to mock the data for the application.
  
  ```
    {
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Smith",
      "age": 25
    }
  ```
  
</details>


## The front end code
> This is for a detailed description of the front end code for your app. Good things to put here are the basic folder and file structure as well as a short description of why this folder and file structure was used. Also be sure to callout any interesting folder or file usage that might confuse a future developer.

## Callouts on how the front end works (optional)
> Any special or interesting aspects of how the front end works should be detailed here. This is meant to be read by developers that need to make sense of these special or interesting aspects of your code without you present so write them with as much code detail as possible to achieve good clarity.

## The back end code
> This is for a detailed description of the back end code for your app. Good things to put here are the basic folder and file structure as well as a short description of why this folder and file structure was used. Also be sure to callout any interesting folder or file usage that might confuse a future developer.
