# Resetting Users Info

One of the pain points in testing with several different users is that once a user has had a submission sent in, it often can't be reused for various reasons and needs to be cleared or reset.

The operation for this is largely unclear as folks at RBPS have managed this in the past for us on the 686c UAT testing work.  We spoke with Liz Rheeler and Christine Cross about this and it was determined that it might be better (faster) to simply create new users as needed through an automated process with a team called HLINC (POCs - Gregory Lloyd, Harold Brittain, Daniel Lattin, Donald Moses, Tsogtbaatar "Batra" Dorj Shantelle Briggs).

Also, to reset users ourselves, we would need access to SHARE.

New test users as they are created, though, will not work locally, only in staging.  Currently we are teting locally because that allows us access t ologs to troubleshoot errors which is difficult in staging.

Currently waiting to hear back from HLINC about what their procedure might be. _Novmber 12, 2020_
