Recently when grading a few homework assignments I came to a few realizations -
- neither of the two homework assignments for front end have anything to do with debugging which is one of the most important parts of front end engineering
- one of the two homework assignments we have requires the engineer to write in vanilla JS which we generally don't use on the job, again this does not reflect the nature of our work
- neither of our homework assignments focus on UI which is one of the most important parts of front end engineering
