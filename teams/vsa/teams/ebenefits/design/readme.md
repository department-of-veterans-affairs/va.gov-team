### Feature Migration Approach

1. Analyze existing feature
2. Conduct discovery research on existing feature
3. Synthesize analysis and research into lo-fi screens and flows
4. Present synthesis/lo-fi visuals at design review
5. Improve fidelity of screens and flows
6. Provide content for sitewide review
7. Present refined mockups at mid-point review
8. Conduct usability testing
9. Refine/finaize screens and flows
10. Review feature in staging
11. Second usability testing round
12. Review feature in production (if possible)
13. Conduct user acceptance testing
