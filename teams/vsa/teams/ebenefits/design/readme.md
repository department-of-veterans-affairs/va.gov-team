### Feature Migration Approach

1. Analyze existing feature
2. Conduct research on existing feature
3. Synthesize analysis and research into lo-fi sketches and flows
4. Take synthesis to design crit (development should be able to start working with the sketches here)
5. Improve fidelity of sketches
6. Conduct usability
7. Present designs for launch crit
