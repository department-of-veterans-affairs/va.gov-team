# Executive Summary

## User Problem Statement
As a Veteran, I want to easily discover, apply for, track, and manage my disability compensation claims on va.gov so that I can have a personalized, guided experiences that provides me access to vital information about VA benefits and services I deserve.

## Solution Goals
Help users manage their entire Disability Compensation claims, reviews and appeals process seamlessly online.

### User Goals
- With resources better presented to the user, they should be able to find and apply for disability benefits with better efficacy.
- By digitizing forms and making them available to be completed online, users will significantly experience shorter turnaround time within every step of their claims process.

### Business Goals
Ensure that as many resources produced by the VA are being leveraged to as many Veterans possible.

## Assumptions
Prioritizations identified for Benefits and Memorials on va.gov align with other systems that are needed to integrate with va.gov. 

## Requirements and Constraints
Onboarding, access and domain knowledge has some upfront challenges.

## Discovery Takeaways
The key to implementing what has been learned is at least two-fold: stay organized and communicate as much as possible.  Notes are useless if they cannot be easily accessed and talking things through with your team allows for shared understanding, team cohesion and improved culture. 

## Solution Approach
Identify and prioritize roadmap.

## Value Propositions
Probably the largest is the placement of resources closer to the user and their anticiapted increased usage.

#### User Value
Having the same type of experience on a government website as they would on a private company website.

#### Business Value
Money spent on programs at the VA will be better utilized.
