# State of the Product: Yellow Ribbon School Search

## Current Focus and Team Status of Team
The Decision Tools Team is comprised of two members - Marci McGuire (PM) and Zach Morel (FE Engineer), who are responsible for the **[Find a Yellow Ribbon School search](https://www.va.gov/education/yellow-ribbon-participating-schools/)** and the **[Find a VA Form search tool](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/)**.   John Hashimoto with the US Digital Service is the Product Owner for both products.

The initial focus of the Decision Tools team is remediating serious **Level 2 508 Accessibility defects** discovered following the Find a VA Form initial MVP launch.   Once those items have been addressed, the focus will shift to connecting Find a Form search results to the Find a Form detail page. 

## Near-Term Delivery Plan

Over the next 6-8 weeks, the team expects to define strategies for improving the quality of the Yellow Ribbon search tool, along with the related desired outcomes and key performance indicators.  Anticipated deliverables include:

 - Identifying baseline analytics metrics for the Find a Yellow Ribbon School search tool
 - Defining product OKRs and KPIs for Q1 2021
 - Detailed strategy and estimate for leveraging data and/or logic already in use in the [GI Bill Comparison Tool](https://www.va.gov/gi-bill-comparison-tool) in the Find a Yellow Ribbon School to return results when common institution abbreviations are searched; e.g., **NYU** when searching for New York University or **NCSU** for North Carolina State University.
 - Detailed strategy and estimate for leveraging data and/or logic already in use in the [GI Bill Comparison Tool](https://www.va.gov/gi-bill-comparison-tool) to weight Find a Yellow Ribbon School search results so that the best matches are displayed first.
 - Work with the Search and Discovery and Public Websites teams on how various search tools across VA.gov should be associated with one another to provide the best possible user experience.
