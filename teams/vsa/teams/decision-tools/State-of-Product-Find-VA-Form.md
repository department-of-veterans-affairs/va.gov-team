# State of the Product: Find a VA Form

## Current Focus and Status of Team
The Decision Tools Team is comprised of two members - Marci McGuire (PM) and Zach Morel (FE Engineer), who are responsible for the **[Find a Yellow Ribbon School search](https://www.va.gov/education/yellow-ribbon-participating-schools/)** and the **[Find a VA Form search tool](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/)**.   John Hashimoto with the US Digital Service is the Product Owner for both products.

The initial focus of the Decision Tools team is remediating serious **Level 2 508 Accessibility defects** discovered following the Find a VA Form initial MVP launch.   Once those items have been addressed, the focus will shift to improving the quality of the Find a VA Form search tool. 

## Near-Term Delivery Plan

Over the next 6-8 weeks, the team expects to remediate serious accessibility defects and define strategies for improving the quality of the Find a VA Form search tool, along with the related desired outcomes and key performance indicators.  Anticipated deliverables include:

 - Remediating MVP 1.0 Level 2 508 Accessibility defects
 - Connecting the Find a VA Form search results page to details pages
 - Defining product OKRs and KPIs for Q1 2021
 - Work with the Search and Discovery and Public Websites teams on how various search tools across VA.gov should be associated with one another to provide the best possible user experience.
