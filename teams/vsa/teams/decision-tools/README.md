## How we work

### Workflow + Cadence

#### Stand-up

- Zoom call
- 15 min
- 3 Question Format: What I did yesterday? What will I do today? Any impediments?

#### Sprint Planning
Outline work to be done this sprint in order to accomplish the team's goals

- 1st Wednesday of every sprint @ 3:00 PM

- 2nd Wed of every sprint @ 2:00 PM

- _any other notes you have_

#### Issue Etiquette
For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the ‚ÄúStandard Issue Template‚Äù):
- Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3 change designation
- Estimate
- Title that explains task
- Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
- Labels: 
  - Team label: `vsa-decision-tools` (add to all issues)
  - Find a VA Form label: `dt-find-va-form`
  - Find a Yellow Ribbon School label: `dt-yellow-ribbon`
  - Discharge Upgrade Wizard lable:  `dt-discharge-upgrade-wizard`
- User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
- Nested in an Epic

All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

#### Acceptance Criteria Based on Tier of Effort
- Tier 1
  - Must be validated in Review via SOCKS by PO + PM + (if UX) Design Lead
  - Ticket Verbiage: Validation of AC items are required by PO + PM + Design Lead prior to promotion to Staging or Prod Environment. 
  - Approval will be triggered by a comment in ticket and act as a trigger for staging/prod release.  
- Tier 2
  - Must be validated in Review via SOCKS by PM or PO 
  - Ticket Verbiage: Validation of AC items are required by PO or PM prior to promotion to Staging or Prod Environment. 
  - Approval will be triggered by a comment in ticket which will act as a trigger for staging/prod release.
- Tier 3 e.g. bugs, 508 issues
  - No Review/SOCKS validation necessary
  - Validation ‚Äî Accessibility and Analytics only tickets go through our standard staging process (since PM/POs can‚Äôt validate those)
  - Ticket Verbiage: Validation of AC items are suggested but not required by PO or PM, once fix has been applied please ensure safe monitoring practice and validation with any applicable cross functional team as applicable.

#### Team Norms
_Update as you see fit! These are some starter norms for you to consider_

- Be respectful, both online and off
- Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
- Speak up! - everyone‚Äôs voice matters
- We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
- Let‚Äôs have fun and do great work!
- Family comes first!

#### Estimating:
Thought process:
- 1 - Easy task, work is known, can be executed quickly
- 2 - Mostly known, doable 
- 3 - Becoming complex
- 5 - Complex, may take a half a sprint
- 8 - Pretty complex, takes up to a full sprint
- 13 - Very complex, needs to be broken down. Consider spike/ discovery? 

#### Slack:
This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.

#### GitHub
GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.

#### General things
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
