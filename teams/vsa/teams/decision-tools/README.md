## How we work

### Workflow + Cadence

#### Stand-up
Check in on people and product progress

- Mon, Tue, Thu, Fri @ 10:30 AM (subject to change).  Not held on last Tue of sprint (Sprint Review and Demo & team Retro will take its place)
- Zoom call
- 15 min
- 3 Question Format: What I did yesterday? What will I do today? Any impediments?

#### Sprint Planning
Outline work to be done this sprint in order to accomplish the team's goals

- 1st Wednesday of every sprint @ 3:00 PM
- 1 hour


#### Retro
Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, what can be improvemed, what questions people have, and any action items

- 1st Tue of every sprint 3:30 pm EST.
- Zoom call
- 1 hour


#### Grooming
Assess and update workload for remainder of sprint

- 2nd Wed of every sprint @ 2:00 PM
- Zoom call
- 1 hour
- _any other notes you have_

#### Issue Etiquette
For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):

- Estimate
- Title that explains task
- Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
- Labels: _your team's labels_
- User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
- Nested in an Epic

All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

#### Team Norms
_Update as you see fit! These are some starter norms for you to consider_

- Be respectful, both online and off
- Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
- Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
- We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
- Let’s have fun and do great work!
- Family comes first!

#### Estimating:
Thought process:
- 1 - Easy task, work is known, can be executed quickly
- 2 - Mostly known, doable 
- 3 - Becoming complex
- 5 - Complex, may take a half a sprint
- 8 - Pretty complex, takes up to a full sprint
- 13 - Very complex, needs to be broken down. Consider spike/ discovery? 

#### Slack:
This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.

#### GitHub
GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.

#### General things
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
