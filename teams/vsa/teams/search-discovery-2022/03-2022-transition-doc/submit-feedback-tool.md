## Feature background
- [Product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/resources-and-support/initiatives/2022-02-submit-feedback-tool/initiative-brief-submit-feedback-tool.md)

- [Existing feature -  'How do you rate' Page Component](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/14579)

- [DOMO Dashboard](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/1522082003)

Resources and support articles currently feature a custom 'How do you rate' page component. This initiative is to work with the Contact Center team (Jason Woodman) to replace the existing 'How do you rate' page component into a Medallia rating component as seen elsewhere on VA.gov.
Medallia 'blue button' feedback components were previously featured on the right side of VA.gov pages. It has since moved near the footer.

Reasons to utilize Medallia:

- Consistent UI/UX throughout VA.gov
- Teams can more easily access and analyze data to make improvements to articles
