# Authenticated experience team charter

**Updated April 2020**

## What we strive for

### Vision

We want to work towards a VA authenticated experience that is so easy and seamless that it feels like a concierge service. We want to meet veterans and their communities (families, caregivers, VSOs, etc.) where they are, and make them feel seen by, reflected in, and guided through their experience at the VA. There are many ways in which this could unfold, but we see a world in which:

- The service member to veteran transition between DoD and VA is so seamless that it goes unnoticed.
- We never ask a veteran to prove they are a veteran (ie. provide a DD214).
- Veterans can easily find and understand what beenfits they might be eligble for.
- Veterans and their communities can apply for/enroll in benefits with one click.
- Veterans and their communities can mostly interact with the VA through text messages and email.
- A veteran's logged in portal can compete with the best private sector experiences.

### Mission 

Our current mission is to create a logged in experience on VA.gov that:

- Differentiates itself from the logged out experience.
- Elevates what we know about veterans and their communities throughout the site so the information tells a story.
- Consolidates personal/benefit data so that it doesn't feel silo'd.
- Guides veterans and their communities towards tasks and tools they need/want to complete.
- Serves up status updates/alerts/action items in a way that makes it easy to act on this information.

### North star objectives

- Reduce the amount of time it takes to interact with the VA
- Make interacting with the VA feel as easy as sending an email
- Make the VA feel like it's a 1:1 experience

## Workflow + Cadence

### Stand-up: people & product check-ins
Daily @ 3pm ET (except Tuesdays) 
20-25 min  
Format:  
1. General Discussion
2. What I did yesterday? 
3. What will I do today? 
4. Any impediments?
5. Recap

### Sprint Planning
Outline team and member focus, goals for sprint:  
1st Wednesday of every sprint  
1-2 hour(s) 

### Retro
Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, areas for improvement, what to start doing:   
2nd Tuesday of every sprint   
30 min

### Grooming
Assess and update workload for remainder of sprint:  
2nd Thursday of every sprint   
1-hour 

### Issue Etiquette
For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):
  * Estimate
  * Title that explains task
  * Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
  * Labels - vsa-authenticated-exp (and cross functional team labels)
  * User Story, Goal, Acceptance Criteria - please fill out the Goal and any known acceptance criteria. The PM will revise as necessary.
  * Epic assigned
  
All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

### Estimation
Estimation is not based on how long something will take to complete, but is rather a combined rating encompassing risk, level of effort (LOE), and complexity.

 1 - Easy task, work is known, can be executed quickly   
 2 - Mostly known, doable
 3 - Becoming complex   
 5 - Very complex, may take a full sprint or longer    
 8 - Needs to be broken down into smaller user stories      

### Team Norms

  * Be respectful, both online and off
  * Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
  * Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
  * We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
  * Let’s have fun and do great work!

**And some logistics:**

Keep as much Slack conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.
GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.
Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to an issue or useful to document, copy them into GitHub.
Our tickets/issues have an estimated level of effort, clear acceptance criteria, and an individual or team assignee before being put in a sprint.
