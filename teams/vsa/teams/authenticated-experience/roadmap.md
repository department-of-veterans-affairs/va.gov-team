## Roadmap

### Goals

The authenticated experience on Vets.gov originated in early 2018. Since we transitioned to VA.gov in late 2018, we  have  left this experience largely untouched, instead focusing on other feature development/enhancements. 

This has left us in a position where we don't have much of an authenticated experience, especially compared to the robustness of the unauthenticated experience. Our logged in experience doesn't meet user needs and expections, and it has left us without a way to guide logged-in users to tools and task. 

It is because of this that we are going to dedicate all of 2020, and as much of 2021 as we need, to revisiting the logged-in experience at a high level. We will revisit the key logged-in pages — the logged-in homepage/dashboard and the user profile — explore a logged-in navigation, and finally establish a better system for on-site notifications (notification center). Our goal is to create the foundational elements we need to develop the logged-in experience over time for veterans and their larger communities (families, caregivers, VSOs, etc).

### Projected timelines for current projects

### Additional potential future projects & feature requests from other teams

|Project|Initiating team|Date of request| Status/Notes|
|----|----|----|----|
|[Logged-in navigation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/navigation-ia)| Auth. exp. | N/A| Revisit after logged-in homepage redesign|
|Notification center| Auth. exp. | N/A| Revisit after logged-in homepage redesign|
|Bad address functionality| Auth. exp. | N/A| This feature is available to us via VA Profile, but we haven't had a chance to integrate it yet. Will be easier to implement either after logged-in homepage redesign or as part of a notification center MVP |
|Integrate "Military information" section of the profile through VA Profile backend| VA Profile | September 2020 | VA Profile is still working on their MVP, so this is not yet ready for us to integrate with|
|Virtual hearing opt-in| Caseflow/Lighthouse | September 2020 | Caseflow/Lighthouse needs to do some research to determine who virtual hearing opt-in might work before coming back to VA.gov|
|ZIP+4 – Updating zip code in the VA.gov profile to elevate the additional 4 digits | N/A | September 2020 | Steve K mentioned that a stakeholder had asked about this, but there's been no formal request. This already supported by VA Profile. |
