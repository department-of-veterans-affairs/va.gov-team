# Executive Summary 

  

## Mission 

Help users accomplish tasks more easily by leveraging what we know about them as a logged in user.

  

## User Problem Statement 

1. I don’t know what I don’t know - what benefits and services can I get access to? 

2. What info does VA know about me and why isn’t it always accurate / consistent? 


## Solution Goals 

Increase Veteran, Caregivers, Dependents, and others easy access to the benefits they deserve. 


#### User Goals 


1. Port Direct Deposit to VA.gov from eBenefits. [Product Outiline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/direct-deposit)

2. Implement a Notifications MVP [Product Outiline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/notifications/notification-settings-product-outline.md)

3. Personalization 2.0 [Product Outiline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0)

4. Address Validation & Override [Product Outiline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/change-address/address-validation/product-outline.md)

5. Bad Address Indicator [Product Outiline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/change-address/bad-address-indicator/product-outline.md)

  

#### Business Goals 

  
1. Porting over Direct Deposit functionality to VA.gov from eBenefits, decreases fraud cases releated to direct deposit, pension and compensation. 

3. Implement a Notifications MVP - brings VetText, Vets360, and VA.gov together to allow Veterans with healthcare to set/manage text notifications for their medical appointments. 

3. Personalization 2.0 - Creates a centralized, modern, and easy to use logged in experience where vets, and others, manage and self-serve all things VA benefits and services related

4. Address Validation & Override - Leverages UAM tools to do real time validation and suggestions with a last ditch override option.

5. Bad Address Indicator - Consumes the BAI indicator from VetProfile and surface a UI notification to the user that the address in question needs attention. 


  

## Questions 

- What are the reasons around why people are currently experiencing fraud regarding their direct deposit information on eBenefits website? 

- What level of personalization can we be confident in? 

-  

## Assumptions 

 
  

## Requirements and Constraints 

  

- Data in the VA itself is non-standard 

- Contact info currently stored across, EVSS, CORPDB, etc. - many locations, and often conflicting 

- 

  

## Discovery Takeaways 

  

## (Potential) Solution Approach(es) 

1. Enable user to update their personal data (address, email, phone) for accuracy and the ablility to update their direct deposit information on VA.gov safe and securely. 

3. Share information with the user based on their personal (existing) and custom (entered) data. 

  

## Value Propositions
