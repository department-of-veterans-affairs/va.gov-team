## Overview

### Mission 

Help veterans accomplish tasks more easily by leveraging what we know about them as a logged in user.

### Vision

"A personalized experience where veterans can easily accomplish what matters to them "
- personalized experience
- relevant information
- notifications/status updates
- complete tasks

### North star objectives

potentials:
1) Minimizing the amount of time veterans spend to accomplish tasks within the AE.
- want this to be a roll up of all possible relevant inputs/metrics

Future note:
If this was an ideal personalized product experience, we would show the user all relevant benefits/tasks that apply to them.
