## Overview

The authenticated experience team aims to create a world-class logged-in experience for veterans and their communities on VA.gov (for more on our vision and mission, see the [team charter](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/authenticated-experience/charter.md)). This product outline goes into detail around the goals, thinking, and metrics that guide our work.  

## User problem statements 

- **As a veteran, I want to be able to log in to VA.gov and easily find the tools and tasks that apply to my specific experience at the VA.**
- **As a veteran, I want to be notified of status updates and action items that apply to my specific experience at the VA.**
- **As a veteran, I want to be able to log in to VA.gov, quickly complete whatever I came to do, and then get back to the rest of my life.**
- **As a veteran, I want the VA to tell me what benefits I qualify for, and then help me learn about them.**

## Business goals 

- Create a logged-in experience that makes it easier to find tools and complete tasks.
- Personalize the logged-in experience across pages by elevating contextually-relevant veteran information.
- Create a usable/scalable landing pad for users (ie. logged-in homepage/dashboard) where they can manage their tools/tasks in once place.
- Make it easier to see and manage personal/contact information.
- Establish a foundation for notifications on VA.gov.
- Create a logged-in experience that can eventually be adapted to other user roles and permissions once VA.gov is able to support them.
- Help veterans explore benefits in which they are interested and may qualify. 

## Questions 

- How do veterans conceptualize the difference between a dashboard/logged-in homepage a profile? What kind of information do they expect to see on each page?
- What kind of notifications do veterans want to see, and where do they want to receive them?
- How can we effectively guide users when they are logged in?
- How can we create a logged-in navigation that doesn't totally eliminate the "explore" content?
- How can we more effectively insert users' information throughout non-tool content?

## Assumptions 

- Veterans want to quickly complete tasks on VA.gov. They want to get in, find what they are looking for, and get out as fast as possible.
- Veterans expect to see themselves reflected in their logged-in experience. They figure that the VA already knows everything about them because of transferred records from DoD and any other information they've already submitted to the VA.
- Veterans want to see status update/notification information when they sign in to VA.gov.
- Veterans want to receive email and text message notifications so they don't have to sign in to the website or call the VA call centers.
- Veterans want us to tell them what benefits they qualify for.

## Requirements and Constraints 

### Requirements

- Our work will be guided by our [vision, mission, and north star objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/authenticated-experience/charter.md#vision).
- Our work will put veterans first.
- Our work will consider the full veteran experience â€” from logged out to logged in, from online to offline.
- When we know information about veterans, we'll elevate it and present it to them in a way that helps them understand their experience and complete tasks.
- We will work to grow the design system so it better accomodates authenticated tools, flows, and use cases.

### Constraints

#### Data
- Data in the VA is complicated and all over the place. Different information is stored across hundreds of databases and is often duplicative or conflicting.
  - EG. Contact info currently stored across, EVSS, CORPDB, etc. - many locations, and often conflicting 
- For data we don't currently have but want, we may need a new ATO to get this information, and this could take a lot of time.
- We don't have a lot of data we want, and we may not be able to get it because it the information isn't digital or is in a database that is a mess/unreliable/will be eventually sunset.

#### Design

- Elements of the logged in experience are set/affected by/affect the logged out experience, so we have to consider this in our work.
- The existing design system is tailored to the needs of unauthenticated content pages. 

## Value Propositions  

Creating a cohesive logged-in experience will:

- Help veterans complete tasks more quickly.
- Increase veteran satisfaction with the VA.
- Reduce the need for multiple touchpoints (other VA websites; VA call centers).
- Help veterans get benefits more quickly.

## KPIs 

- Increase the amount of people who:
  - Log in to VA.gov.
  - Verify their identities.
  - Manage their benefits online.
- Reduce the amount of people who call in to the call center for status updates on claims and other information.
- Reduce the amount of time it takes to complete tasks in the authenticated experience.
- Increase the amount of people who navigate to tools via the logged-in homepage and logged in navigation.
- Increase in the amount of VA partners who want to build on VA.gov instead of building one-off tools.
