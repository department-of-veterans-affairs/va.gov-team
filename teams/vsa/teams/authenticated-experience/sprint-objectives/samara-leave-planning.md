# Long term planning for Samara's maternity leave

## My VA

### Q2 2021 (April – June)

### My VA 2.0 launch

- Finish My VA 2.0 build
- My VA 2.0 [VSP pre-launch collab points](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/vsp-collaboration-cycle/README.md)
- My VA UAT
- (Hopefully) My VA 2.0 phased launch begins

### Q3 2021 (July - September)

### My VA 2.0 launch

- If phased launch didn't start/complete in Q2, then this should happen very early in Q3.

### My VA 2.0 project KPI tracking

-	Track My VA 2.0 project KPIs for 3 month post-launch, then discuss plan for making additional improvements based on those analytics.

### Run usability testing on My VA in production

**When**: Post-launch; Should take no more than 1 month

**Objectives**: 
-	Assess usability of the tool with veterans’ real information.
-	Assess whether people can find My VA and the information it contains when all of VA.gov is available to them.
-	Post-testing, determine next steps and how improvements might fit into roadmap.

### Run experiment(s) on how we can better elevate action items

**When**: Post-launch; May take the full quarter

**Objectives**:
- Evaluate patterns with real users that will allow us to more effectively elevate action items on My VA

**Additional info**: 

-	Action items, ie. items on which the VA needs action from a veteran to move a process forward, are the most important thing that veterans want to see on their dashboard. However, action items are currently spread throughout My VA, and as we add functionality over time, it could be hard to find specific action needed items, especially if they are buried at the bottom of My VA. We should explore how we can more effectively elevate action items in order to create a scalable strategy.
-	The debt management team has been reaching out to us since spring 2021 about adding a debt-related notification to My VA. This could be something to consider in any experiments or updates.

### Q4 2021 (October - December)

Samara should be back at this point, during which we will discuss the status of My VA work at this point and determine the right paths forward.

## VA.gov Profile: Communications permissions (notification preferences)

### Q2 2021 (April – June)

**Goal: Get final details from VA Profile, design, build**

**Note**: This is dependent on VA Profile being ready and getting us the things we need. We need final groups, items (notifications), and content in order to finish the research convo guide, conduct usability testing, and to move on to QA and the rest of the pre-launch checklist. Additionally, we need time before research for the content and IA teams to review the actual groups/notifications and provide feedback to VA Profile. All of this may affect the final timeline.
