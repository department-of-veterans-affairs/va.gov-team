# Long term planning for Samara's maternity leave

### [Long term planning spreadsheet](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/authenticated-experience/sprint-objectives/Long%20term%20project%20planning.xlsx)

This is my best estimate on things as of when I go on leave, but please please PLEASE feel free to adjust based on how things shake out in reality. This is meant to be a guide, not a mandate.

## Q2 2021 (April – June) goals

**Samara will be out at the end of this quarter**.

### My VA

- **2.0 redesign**
  - Finish build
  - QA and VSP reviews
  - UAT
  - Begin phased launch
- [Run experiment(s) on how we can better elevate action items](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/action-items-discovery)
 
### VA.gov Profile: Communications permissions (notification preferences)

- Work with VANotify/VEText to define items and groups
- Design and research
- Start frontend build

### VA.gov Profile: Preferred medical facility

- Design and research
- Begin build

### VA.gov Profile: User roles & permissions

- MVP picked: Dependents user role.
- Lihan will help out with backend work.

## Q3 2021 (July - September) goals

**Samara will be out for most of this quarter**.

### My VA

- **My VA 2.0 redesign**
  - Complete phased launch
- [Track My VA 2.0 project KPIs for 3 months post-launch](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va#measuring-success)
  - The reports you need are linked from the product outline above. Just be sure to adjust dates accordingly.
- Options for additional work:
  - **Option A**: Scope out an MVP for elevating action items; do additional discovery, design, and research if necesary; start build.
  - **Option B**: Discovery on what additional information we can/should add next to the dashboard (eg. payment history and financial info and education info keep coming up repeatedly in research).
  - **Option C**: If the user roles and permissions work is well defined and requires work from our team, Tressa might need to help out with that instead. Kevin will need to help the team determine this.
 
### VA.gov Profile: Communications permissions (notification preferences)

- Complete build

**On hold while VANotify and VA Profile complete their integration. Current estimate for that is some time in August.**

Once the backend build is complete...

- QA and pre-launch checklist items

### VA.gov Profile: Preferred medical facility

- Complete build
- QA and all pre-launch checklist items
- UAT
- Launch preferred medical facility functionaity before end of the quarter

### VA.gov Profile: User roles & permissions

**Dependents user roles research**

- **Who**: Liz or Tressa, depending on who is available; Oversight from Kevin Hoffman.
- **When**: Middle of July (Sprint 52). This should be about two sprints — one for planning and recruiting; one for research and summary.
- **What**: User research that will help define what a dependent user role MVP would look like on VA.gov.

It is an OCTO/VA.gov priority that a new user role exist on VA.gov before the end of the year. While our team is not solely responsible for this work, I have volunteered us to help out with some initial discovery so someone (Kevin?) can define what a dependent user role MVP might look like. The research our team does will inform that.

In terms of research objectives, here are some initial thoughts:

**Goals**

- Be able to define dependents' top priorities.
  - The initially proposed MVP was that a dependent should be able to sign on and view their benefit letter. Do they care about this? Is this a good MVP? What is the most important thing a dependent needs to do?
- From this research, be able to define what a dependent user role MVP would look like on VA.gov.

**Additional Thoughts**

- One way to better understand dependent's top priorities is to assess what they already do online to manage their relationship with the VA (could be on sites other than VA.gov).
- We'll likely also want to quickly look into dependents' VA.gov accounts to asses what data they can already see and what they can't. For example, we  know from direct deposit for edu UAT that depedents can already see this information in their profile without any additional work from us. Where else on the site are dependents' already able to view data (eg. benefit letters, other edu info, etc.)? 
- We should also make sure we understand how someone gets correlated as a dependent in the VA ecosystem. This is likely something we can learn more about through the eBenefits migration team (Jason Wolf), so likely not something we'd ask dependents about.
