# Long term planning for Samara's maternity leave

## My VA

- **Q2 2021 (April – June) goal**: Finish build; QA; VSP reviews; UAT; Begin phased launch of My VA 2.0; Run experiment on elevating action items
- **Q3 2021 (July - September) goal**: Complete launch; Monitor analytics; *Maybe usability testing? Maybe run another experiment or figuring out how to implement findings from initial experiment? Maybe start on My VA for new user type?**
- **Q4 2021 (October - December) goal**: Determine next steps after Samara gets back

### Run experiment(s) on how we can better elevate action items

**When**: Post-launch; May take the full quarter

**Objectives**:
- Evaluate patterns with real users that will allow us to more effectively elevate action items on My VA

**Additional info**: 

-	Action items, ie. items on which the VA needs action from a veteran to move a process forward, are the most important thing that veterans want to see on their dashboard. However, action items are currently spread throughout My VA, and as we add functionality over time, it could be hard to find specific action needed items, especially if they are buried at the bottom of My VA. We should explore how we can more effectively elevate action items in order to create a scalable strategy.
-	The debt management team has been reaching out to us since spring 2021 about adding a debt-related notification to My VA. This could be something to consider in any experiments or updates.
-	We already have two notifications on the dashboard — "You have X unread messages" and claim status updates. These could also be good starting points.

**Potential plan**

- Short discovery on how action items are surfaced on other websites/tools. There may already be some good documentation on this from Liz's initial My VA discovery.
- Low-fi sketching/mockups: Iterate on a few ideas. Also think about how or if this might change the current design, and in what ways.
- Figure out best method for testing — is it usability testing? Click testing? Moderated or unmoderated?
- Run research.
- Write up and recommendations for potential implementation into the My VA experience.

### My VA 2.0 project KPI tracking

-	Track My VA 2.0 project KPIs for 3 month post-launch, then discuss plan for making additional improvements based on those analytics.

### Run usability testing on My VA in production

**When**: Q3, but only if the research is targeted and we feel like it will provide meaningful insights; Should take no more than 1 month

**Objectives**: 
-	Assess usability of the tool with veterans’ real information.
-	Assess whether people can find My VA and the information it contains when all of VA.gov is available to them.
-	Post-testing, determine next steps and how improvements might fit into roadmap.

## VA.gov Profile: Communications permissions (notification preferences)

- **Q2 2021 (April – June) goal**: Get final details from VA Profile, design, build
- **Q3 2021 (July - September) goal**: Launch MVP of communication permissions (notification preferences)
- **Q4 2021 (October - December) goal**: Launch this work if it didn't launch in Q3; Otherwise, monitor analytics

**Note**: This is dependent on VA Profile being ready and getting us the things we need.

## VA.gov Profile: Preferred medical facility

- **Q2 2021 (April – June) goal**: Design,research, begin build
- **Q3 2021 (July - September) goal**: Launch preferred medical facility functionaity before end of the quarter
- **Q4 2021 (October - December) goal**: Launch this work if it didn't launch in Q3; Otherwise, monitor analytics

## VA.gov Profile: User roles & permissions

### Q2 2021 (April - June)

What we know so far:

- According to Christine Dillman, the MVP use case is for dependents and the functionality they need is to view their benefit letter.
- They are going to start scoping this feature on 5.5.21, including all discovery work that is needed.
- It is unclear what the expectations are or will be for the profile and My VA dashboard. It is also unclear who defines that.
- However, we can likely get Lihan in this quarter to help with discovery and integration work.

### Q3 2021 (July - September)

- We'll hopefully have greater clarity on how this work will impact our team in this quarter soon.
