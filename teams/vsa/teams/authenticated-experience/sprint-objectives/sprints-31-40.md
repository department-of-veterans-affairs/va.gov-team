Any outstanding tickets from last sprint, plus the following:

### Profile 2.0

Jason from eBenefits will create these tickets, but it's OK to include them in our sprint epic.

- Review the feature on eBenefits
- Talk to eBenefits: What functionality is not clear/shown? What questions do we have?
- Understand what education benefits gets updated with DD edu and what does not, and document this
- Mockups?

**Backend**

- Begin: Create BGS CH33 DDEFT Service integration #13286

Note: Lihan will also be working on [#12089](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/12089) for the Caregiver team, so he will likely not finish the direct deposit work this sprint.
