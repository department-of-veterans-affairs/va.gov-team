Any outstanding tickets from last sprint, plus the following:

### Profile 2.0

- FE backlog updates we can bring in

### Logged-in homepage

**Design**

- LIH Design Intent checkpoint #13255 (I moved this from sprint 30)

- Start: Design health care section of the homepage

**FE**

- Technical comparative analysis: How do other websites handle having a logged out and logged in homepage?

### Direct deposit for Edu

**Design**

Jason from eBenefits will create these tickets, but it's OK to include them in our sprint epic.

- Review the feature on eBenefits
- Talk to eBenefits: What functionality is not clear/shown? What questions do we have?
- Understand what education benefits gets updated with DD edu and what does not, and document this
- Mockups?

**Backend**

Note: Lihan will also be working on [#12089](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/12089) for the Caregiver team, so he will likely not finish the direct deposit work this sprint.

### Pact work

- VSA Auth Experience - Pact setup for [product name] #13336

## Sprint 32 (10/7 – 10/20)

### Profile 2.0

Any tickets that aren't finished from sprint 31, plus:

### Logged-in homepage

**PM**

- Help create tickets for the disability/claims section design work.

**Design**

*Phase 2: Design Healthcare, Disability/Claims sections*

Note: The goal was to have the health care section largely completed in sprint 31 and then to start on the disability/claims section this sprint. Based on out 10/2 convo with Tressa and Cassandra, I think they're behind and I'm questioning whether the disability/claims section will be started this sprint. However, we should get the disability/claims section tickets created and talk about long term planning with them over the next 3ish sprints.

Week 1 of sprint 33
