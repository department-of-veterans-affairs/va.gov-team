## Sprint 71 (4/6 - 4/19) 

### General

- Onboard Sharon #39204

### Personal information revisions

Goal: Finish BE and connect to frontend

**PM**

- Request QA for 5/4 - 5/17 sprint
- Finish all QA prep
- Finish call center guide

**Design**

- Finish call center guide
- If time, UAT research plan and conversation guide 

**FE**

- Start connecting frontent to backend; Finish this if possible

**BE**

- Finish BE!!

### Bad address indicator

**PM**

Note: We can move this a sprint if Sharon needs to focus on general onboarding before jumping into this task.

- Start on QA use cases (this will not be completed yet)
- Figure out how we can get a staging user with the bad address indicator for testing (might require working with VA Profile)

### Notification preferences

**PM**

- Once we have final IA/content recommendations, make sure those are communicated to VA Profile

**Design**

- Update mocks to add the new comp & pen notification
- Review with IA and content (so we can get feedback to VA Profile team)

### Address change messaging

- Continue work (may need to check in with Christina and Adam on current status)

### MHV research

- Liz to deliver final report

## Sprint 72 (4/20 - 5/3)

### Personal info revisions

Anything outstanding from sprint 71, plus...

**PM**

- Submit call center guide for review
- All QA-related tickets (moving over from sprint 71)

**Design - Christina**

- Finish contact center guide (moved from sprint 71)
- Create UAT research plan (moved from sprint 71)
- Create UAT Convo Guide #39866

**FE - Adam**

Moved these from sprint 71

- Add ability to Add/Update Preferred Name #38953
- Add ability to Add/Update Gender Identity #38952

**Everyone**

- Once the feature is fully complete in staging, everyone on the project (Sharon, Christina, Adam, Tom) should go into staging and review the feature to make sure it's ready for QA. Note that this might need to get moved to the beginning of sprint 73 before QA.

### Bad address indicator

**BE - Tom**

Tom should finish all backend work for personal information revisions first. So, if there is still outstanding work from sprint 71 or other odds and ends that aren't on my radar, he should do that first before moving on to bad address indicator work.

- Work on bad address indicator emails
  - Initial email blast that will go out to everyone with the BAI once the functionality launches
  - Individual emails that will go out to folks if a new BAI is added to their accounts *after* we launch the feature

### MHV profile research

**Design - Liz**

- Share results with OCTO
- Share results with MHV team/stakeholders

### Notification prefs

**PM - Sharon**

- Share IA/content recommendations with VA Profile #39381 (moved from sprint 71 because content/IA aren't done)

**FE - Mark**

- Review how this feature was built so we make sure we understand the frontend implementation
  -  Need to determine if Samara's understanding is correct, and if VA Profile is sending us the groups (eg "Your health care"), items (eg. Appointment reminders), and channels (eg. text) or if some of this is hard coded on our end.
  -  Note: You'll see that we've added some code to show the health care section conditionally, but the other section is not gate by any conditional logic.
  -  Ultimately, our goal is to make sure we know what we need to do as new notification preferences are added.

### Direct desposit

**Design - Liz**

- Update designs to account for showing direct deposit section persistently instead of conditionally
  - We will still show the DS Logon/MHV gate.
  - We'll need a state for people who have neither type of direct deposit.
  - For people who have at least one kind of direct deposit, the design shouldn't really change.
  - We'll need to change how we handle errors for this section when we are having backend difficulties. Right now, an alert shows on Personal & Contact Information if we are having trouble connecting to the backend. We'll no longer need to show this alert on the Personal & Contact Information section. We'll be able to show that within the direct deposit section because we show the section no matter what.
  - In the Medallia data, people mentioned that they receive education payments via check and want to set up direct deposit on VA.gov. People can't set up direct deposit for education on VA.gov, they have to call in. We should create some copy that let's them know this. Note: People can set up direct deposit for the first time for comp & pen, so we do not need to add this copy to that section.

## Sprint 78 (7/13 - 7/26)

### PTO 

Liz: Jul 22 - 29

### Priorities

- **Personal info**: Submit for 508 review
- **Military info**: UAT and start launch (pending VA Profile being ready)
- **Bad address indicator**: Research summary and design updates
- **Documentation**: Contact info and Military info
- **Forms system updates**: Discovery and scoping
- **Notification preferences**: Work as needed, though I don't have any definitive work right now.

### Personal info revisions

**PM**

- Submit for 508 review (or at least find out what we need to do for this)

### Military info updates

**PM**

- Coordinate UAT
  - We can only start UAT *after* VA Profile has completed the ICD and updated access permissions, so please wait for me to get the all-clear from them before proceeding. 

**BE - Tom**

- Launch to 25%
- Launch to 50%, if time

### Bad address indicator

**PM**

- Finalize QA documentation
- Request QA for sprint 80 (8/10-23)

**Design - Christina**

- Summarize research
- Design updates from research (if applicable)

### Documentation

**Contact information - Liz**

**This is actually happening now in sprint 77 since Liz's My VA work got postponed, so we can include in the sprint 77 epic and not sprint 78 epic**

- Create plan for documentating Contact Info section
  - This is a big one, and includes address validation.
  - I think Christina has already put together some documentation on the new confirmation modal we added to the home address field that allows people to update their mailing address at the same time, so you might want to check in with her about this.
- Start on documentation updates  

**Military information - Tom**

- Fully document the feature in [the military info github folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information)
  - Given that this is a pretty simple read-only feature, this should be a low level of effort. However, I'd still recommend grabbing 30 minutes of Liz's time to consult on how we can be thorough about this. There are probably things that can be learned from her direct deposit docs, recognizing that the military info documentation will be much simpler since the feature is much less complex.

### Forms system updates

**FE - Mark/Adam**

- Scope and plan this work
  - What needs to be done?
  - How can we break this down? Section by section? Form by form? Something else?
  - Roughly, how long do we think this will take?
  - How can we validate the updates to the forms functionality?
  - Create tickets (it would be helpful if FE did as much ticket creation as possible so Sharon can focus on some other things)

### Notification preferences

- Determine if we are going to pursue any default opt-in work now
- TBD based on stakeholder needs and scheduling. We've got the MHV working group and 1095B functionality on our radar and will meet with those teams as needed.

## Sprint 79 (7/27 - 8/9)

### PTO

- Samara: Aug 1 - 5
- Christina: Jul 28 - 29
- Liz: Largely supporting My VA team this sprint

### Personal information revisions

Fully document the feature.

**Design - Christina**

- Create use case and other design documentation
  - Seeing Liz's examples for Direct deposit and Contact info should be helpful 

**FE - Adam**

- Create any relevant frontend docs for personal info

**BE - Tom**

- Create BE documentation for personal info

### Military information

This assumes the VA Profile ICD is updated and we are given access permissions in prod. **Please do not launch this feature until I'm back from vacation**.

**PM - Sharon**

- Complete internal UAT with real veterans

**BE - Tom**

**Design - Liz**

- Initial mockups of the 1095B preference [Ticket is #45073](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/45073)
- Initial mockup of "you have changed your preference" email [Ticket is #45074](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/45074)
- Work with content for both notification preferences mockup and confirmation email -- Not sure if this needs a separate ticket from the ones already created.
- Get initial mockups/content to 1095B team for review with their legal team [Ticket is #45075](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/45075)
