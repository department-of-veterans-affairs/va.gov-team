### General profile needs

**PM**

- QA contact information after 12/17 on staging re: VA Profile migrating to new API to make sure all our functionality works

**FE/BE**

- Update how we handle loading direct deposit for edu information so it doesn't stall loading the rest of the profile. A couple of things on this:
  - This might involve a design update as well, but let's talk strategy first before determining whether we need design or not 
  - I don't know if this is entirely a frontend task or if it will involve backend work as well. Jason's team seems to be handling this by [putting things into background jobs](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CE4304QPK/p1639150268268300?thread_ts=1639061573.262200&cid=CE4304QPK) to not stall out the rest of the functionality. Should we consider something similar?

### Personal information updates

This depends on whether the Perigean contract is back up and running.

**Design**

- Update research plan with new dates (assuming this will be after the holiday)
- Recruit for research (contract should be back up and running on December 13)
- Confirm with Josh & Angela whether they reviewed our designs for the midpoint review. If not, please set up some time to talk through the designs with them to determine if there are any accessibility concerns.


**FE**

- Continue whatever is left of the frontend build
