### Alerts

Goal: By the end of this sprint, I would love to be able to define what needs to happen to get this work done so we can accurately scope the project.

- Meet with VANotify ([#30612](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30612))
- Scope technical approach ([#30613](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30613))
  - How will we leverage the VANotify platform?
  - What changes do we need VANotify to make? How long will that take? Does VANotify need our help to update their platform?
  - What work do we need to do? How long will it take?
- Finalize intended design approach and determine next steps ([#30636](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30636))
  - Finalize mockups
  - Do we need more research? 
  - Which notifications in VANotify to show as alerts on VA.gov?
  - What is our plan for content?

### User roles research

- Scope research ([#30892](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30892)
  - What questions do we intend to answer?
  - At a high level, what do we need to do to answer these questions?
  - How long do we think this work will take (including final research report & readout)?
- Start research

### My VA: Add edu section

**Design**

Design discovery

- **Ticket**: (31604) Talk to edu team about what they know to be important to edu users. We may show very little of it in MVP, but it'll be helpful in determining what's a useful baseline. For reference, [here is the education section of the website](https://www.va.gov/education/) to give you an idea of what people might need to do.
- **Ticket**:(31607) Look through My VA research to see what edu-related info people have mentioned as important.
- **Ticket**: (31608) Look at analytics for top edu tasks. Here are some helpful reports:
  - [Top 50 pages in the last year](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-pages/a50123418w177519031p184624291/_u.date00=20201012&_u.date01=20211011&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.rowCount=50/)   
  - [Top 50 education pages in the last year](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-pages/a50123418w177519031p184624291/_u.date00=20201012&_u.date01=20211011&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.rowCount=50&explorer-table.filter=~2Feducation&_r.tabId=explorer/)
- **Ticket**: (31609) Determine what triggers the education section. If we can only tee off of the education direct deposit, that means we can only show this section to people who already receive edu benefits, which means we only want to elevate the edu tasks that matter to that group. Talk to edu team about if they are aware of APIs we can tap into besides the one that tells us if someone receives edu payments.
- **Not a ticket, just a note**: If we determine that the only thing that is useful to show/the only thing we have data for is payment info, we may want to consider creating a payment/financial section before an edu section. That way, we could show all payment info, not just for edu benefits.
