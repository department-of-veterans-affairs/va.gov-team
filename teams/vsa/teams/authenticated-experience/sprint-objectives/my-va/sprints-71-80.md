## Sprint 71 (4/6 - 4/19) 

[#37608](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/37608)

- If applicable: Add Columbus, OH to list of Cerner facilities #38551

### General

- Say goodbye to Heather :(
- Welcome back AJ :) #39292

### Payment info

- Updates from staging review, if necessary #39521
- If all is good to go, recruit and hold UAT #38194
- PM: During UAT, make sure we can see analytics coming in for new links #39280
  - [Use this report](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-event-pages/a50123418w177519031p176188361/explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&_r.drilldown=analytics.pagePath:www.va.gov~2Fmy-va~2F,analytics.eventCategory:Interactions) and make sure you see [all new links for which we've added tracking](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/37589).
  - You'll need to filter the report to add between 100 - 250 results, since the new links will only have been clicked a handful of times during UAT.
  - Success: We see data coming in for all new links.
  - Only do this if we hold UAT this sprint

### On-site notifications

**PM**

- VANotify to start work; evaluate what they need to do so we can plan our own timelines
- Do we have a plan for QA? How are we going to trigger a notification for testing? #34543

**Design**

- Explore notification style so we don't have to use the alert/error styling #39090

**Medical co-pays/debts**

- TBD. Need to figure out if we need more explorations or if we have designs ready for testing. (#38984 exploration continues)

### My VA audit

**Design**

- Audit health care #39050
- Audit benefit payments and debts #39051
- Audit applications in progress #39052
- If time, regroup with Samara/AJ (or Heather if she is still here) on existing states #39285

## Sprint 72 (4/20 - 5/3)

4. On-site notifictions

### Payment history

LAUNCH!!!

**PM**

- Monitor launch to 25%
- Monitor launch to 50%
- *For V2 updates*: Collab cycle kickoff
- *For V2 updates*: Collab cycle design intent

**FE**

- Flip feature flag for launch to 25%
- Flip feature flag for launch to 50%
- Don't show an error message if people have no payment history at the VA ([Slack convo](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C909ZG2BB/p1649873367021449))

**Design**

- *For V2 updates*: Collab cycle design intent

### On-site notifications

VANotify to complete their work in the next two sprints

**PM**

- Determine QA plan (4/20 meeting)
- Determine if there is any way to do UAT on this feature

**FE**

- Connect frontend to backend (if it didn't happen in sprint 71)

### My VA health care seciton: Cerner launch

- Add Columbus to list of facilities that see Cerner alert. #38551

### My VA health care section: Update "Next Appointment" connection

**FE**

- Discovery: Update Next Appointment feature to connect to V2 of VAOS
  - [V0 docs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/modules/vaos/app/docs/vaos/v0/vaos.yaml)
  - [V2 docs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/modules/vaos/app/docs/vaos/v2/vaos_v2.yaml)
 - If possible, make this update
 - Note: V2 has not launched to prod yet, but is on staging. This will need to be gated to not go to prod before VAOS V2 goes to prod.

## Sprint 73 (5/4 - 5/17)

[#39608](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/39608)

Whatever is not done from sprint 72, plus:

### PTO

- Erica: 5/3 - 5/10
- AJ: 5/4 - 5/6

### My VA: Benefit payments & debts

**Design**

- *For V2*: Updates coming out of the design intent (this assumes design intent happened in sprint 72)

**FE**

- *For V1*: Launch to 100%

### My VA: Audit

**Design**

- Review audit with team to make sure nothing is missing

### On-site notifications: MVP

**PM**

- Regroup to figure out if we need to remove debt alert in benefit payments and debts before notifications launch
  - This is because of analytics tracking -- I'm unsure whether we can track clicks into the debt tool separately for each alert.
- Figure out QA plan with DMC (backend team)

**FE**

- Continue/finish frontend, including handling of multiple alerts

## Sprint 74 (5/18 - 5/31)
[Epic: #40777](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/40777)

### Payment and debts section

We'll continue to monitor analytics for V1, but otherwise, these tasks are all for V2:

**PM**

- Submit sitewide content/IA review ([collab cycle](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Sitewide-Content-and-IA-intake-request.2124906551.html))

**Design**

- Design updates if they didn't happen or weren't finished in sprint 73
- Work with PM to submit sitewide content/IA review
- Research planning -- what kind of research do we need, and when should we do it?

### My VA health care section

- Launch Next Appointment update when VAOS V2 goes out
  - We can move this to the following sprint if the VAOS team is not launching before the end of May

### My VA audit

**Design**

- If the audit is done, Angela should share it with the team
- If it's not done, let's talk about what still needs to happen

### My VA redirect

- Make sure we'll be able to get weekly Medallia reports as needed
- Determine preliminary launch date

### On-site notifications

**PM**

- Figure out analytics issue -- can we track the on-site notification separately from what we have in payments & debts?
