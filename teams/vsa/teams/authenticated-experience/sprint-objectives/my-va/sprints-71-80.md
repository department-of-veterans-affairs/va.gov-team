## Sprint 71 (4/6 - 4/19) 

[#37608](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/37608)

- If applicable: Add Columbus, OH to list of Cerner facilities #38551

### General

- Say goodbye to Heather :(
- Welcome back AJ :) #39292

### Payment info

- Updates from staging review, if necessary #39521
- If all is good to go, recruit and hold UAT #38194
- PM: During UAT, make sure we can see analytics coming in for new links #39280
  - [Use this report](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-event-pages/a50123418w177519031p176188361/explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&_r.drilldown=analytics.pagePath:www.va.gov~2Fmy-va~2F,analytics.eventCategory:Interactions) and make sure you see [all new links for which we've added tracking](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/37589).
  - You'll need to filter the report to add between 100 - 250 results, since the new links will only have been clicked a handful of times during UAT.
  - Success: We see data coming in for all new links.
  - Only do this if we hold UAT this sprint

### On-site notifications

**PM**

- VANotify to start work; evaluate what they need to do so we can plan our own timelines
- Do we have a plan for QA? How are we going to trigger a notification for testing? #34543

**Design**

- Explore notification style so we don't have to use the alert/error styling #39090

**Medical co-pays/debts**

- TBD. Need to figure out if we need more explorations or if we have designs ready for testing. (#38984 exploration continues)

### My VA audit

**Design**

- Audit health care #39050
- Audit benefit payments and debts #39051
- Audit applications in progress #39052
- If time, regroup with Samara/AJ (or Heather if she is still here) on existing states #39285

## Sprint 72 (4/20 - 5/3)

**PM**

- Monitor launch to 25%
- Monitor launch to 50%
- *For V2 updates*: Collab cycle kickoff
- *For V2 updates*: Collab cycle design intent

**FE**

- Flip feature flag for launch to 25%
- Flip feature flag for launch to 50%
- Don't show an error message if people have no payment history at the VA ([Slack convo](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C909ZG2BB/p1649873367021449))

**Design**

- *For V2 updates*: Collab cycle design intent

### My VA: Audit

**Design**

- Review audit with team to make sure nothing is missing

### On-site notifications: MVP

**PM**

- Regroup to figure out if we need to remove debt alert in benefit payments and debts before notifications launch
  - This is because of analytics tracking -- I'm unsure whether we can track clicks into the debt tool separately for each alert.
- Figure out QA plan with DMC (backend team)

**FE**

- Continue/finish frontend, including handling of multiple alerts

## Sprint 74 (5/18 - 5/31)
[Epic: #40777](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/40777)

- Work with PM to submit sitewide content/IA review
- Research planning -- what kind of research do we need, and when should we do it?

### My VA health care section

- Launch Next Appointment update when VAOS V2 goes out
  - We can move this to the following sprint if the VAOS team is not launching before the end of May

1. On-site notifications
2. Cerner updates
3. My VA redirect
4. Payment info V2
5. Audit updates

There are *a lot* of PM tasks this sprint. The sprint is mostly PM stuff moving along each project. We should talk about how this work can be divided among AJ, Erica, and Samara (as needed).

Also, besides the Cerner updates, I don't have any frontend priorities for Taylor right now. If there are no carryover tickets from last sprint or FE tickets in the backlog, please check in with the engineering lead to get him some work for this sprint.

## Sprint 76 (6/15 - 6/28)
[Epic: #40785](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/40785)

### PTO

- **Tom**: 6/17 - 6/24 (this might affect end-to-end testing for on-site notifications)

Projects are in priority order:

### On-site notifications

**Full team**

- End-to-end testing. How we are going to handle this:
  -  Once VANotify has completed their backend testing, we will ask DMC to add the test data for a subset of staging users. If we can then validate that on-site notifications showed up in those accounts as expected, there is no need to hold an e2e call.
  -  However, if we ask DMC to add debts and no on-site notification shows up, we should hold a call to troubleshoot the issue. 

**PM**

- Hold QA go/no-go
- Fill out release plan
- Support call center guide updates

**Design**

- Call center guide updates (can use My VA guide) 

**QA**

- Tze to conduct QA

### My VA redirect

**PM**

- Submit IA review (if not already done)
- Test the feature once it's in staging (QA)
- Figure out what contact center guide updates need to happen

**FE**

- Code implementation by identity team

**Design -- Liz**

- UAT planning

### My VA: Cerner updates

**FE**

- (531) Boise: Go-live -- 6/25/2022

### Payments V2

Design is on hold bc of midpoint review

**PM**

- Midpoint review prep, including starting a preliminary list of QA tasks
- Hold midpoint review by the end of the sprint if possible

### Audit

**Design**

- Design for Claim status & health care sections 

## Sprint 77 (6/29 - 7/12)
[Epic: #40787](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/40787)

### PTO

- Samara: July 5 - 6

### My VA Audit

This can be on hold this sprint if Angela doesn't have bandwidth due to payments V2 research. However, if she does:

**Design**

- Preliminary research planning
  - This is separate from a formal research plan, though you may want to document some thoughts to include in the research plan when we get there.
  - Do we need to test in code? If so, how do we plan on doing this (prod, code-pen or equivalent, staging)? Make sure the method serves our objectives.

### Documentation

This is a stretch goal and can be moved to next sprint if needed. PMs should be focused on on-site notifications and the My VA redirect as top priorities.

- Create a plan for updating My VA documentation in Github (see Liz's plan in [#40862](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/40862#issuecomment-1128093147) for guidance)

## Sprint 78 (7/13 - 7/26)
[Epic: #40788](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/40788)

This is roughly in priority order, though the redirect and on-site notifications are about the same level of priority. **My VA audit & updates and documentation efforts are currently on hold unless people have bandwidth**.
