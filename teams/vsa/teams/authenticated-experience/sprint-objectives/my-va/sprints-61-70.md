### General My VA improvement

**FE**

- Update how we handle the education block in the "Benefits you might be interested in" section [#33976](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/33976)

**Design**

- Rethink the "Benefits you might be interested in" section
  - The endpoint we are using to determine whether we show education benefits or not has been acting unreliably and affecting loading of this whole section.
  - I also think some people who could apply for health care aren't seeing the prompt.
  - How can we update this section? Show all three blocks? Remove this section altogether and add prompts to healthcare/disability/education elsewhere?

### My VA updates: Adding payment information

Research planning/midpoint review planning

**PM**

- Schedule midpoint review for next sprint
- Put together list of test cases

**Design**

- Finish design if not already done
- Research planning/convo guide
- Recruit if possible (nice to have, not a requirement)
- Work with PM on list of test cases

**FE**

- Technical discovery. Based on this, Taylor should be able to define how the following will work:
  - Whether Tressa's proposal for when this section will show (or not) works
  - How he will retrieve the payment information we tend to show
  - How he will show the debt information we need to show
  - Any other technical details that we should define before moving into implementation 

### On-site alerts MVP

Resume project!!

**PM**

-  Work with team to define needs for VANotify, determine what they need to do, and determine timeline for any work they need to do.

**Design**

- Now that this project is back on, do we want to update how where/how we plan to show alerts on My VA?
  - If not, that's fine. If so, we'll need to update designs accordingly. 

**BE**

- Determine next steps for backend build; If possible, Lihan can start to implement build if possible
