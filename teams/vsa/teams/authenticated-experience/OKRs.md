# PERSONALIZATION OKRS

## MEASURABLE FOR THE RELEASE QUARTER

### Background

“North Star” strategic objectives:
1. Increase the use of VA’s self-service tools
2. Enable faster access to care and more timely delivery of services
3. Improve the experience our users have when interacting with the VA

### Objective
Empower Veterans to achieve their goals at the VA

OR

Increase the use of VA’s self-service tools

OR

Ship Profile-Dashboard and establish baseline metrics

### Key Results
- Improve baseline site satisfaction score 20% (Delight)
- Double LOA3 account signups QoQ (Value Prop)
- Facilitate 100k contact info updates (Throughput)
- ~~Bring 1000 users back into the system from a notification (Throughput)~~
- 50k new applications initiated through dashboard/ action center (Discoverability)


#### Notes
- There are other pressing Veteran needs that come out of the research, like Claim Status and eFolder/ doc storage — but those are located in other transaction teams. We will incorporate them on completion, otherwise hard to build a KR around them.


#### Questions
- How should we manage baseline customer satisfaction? NPS? NPS per app, as well as sitewide?


#### Quotes
- A lack of ongoing benefits training leaves Veterans at a loss for what they're eligible for and how to get started with benefits. (VCRD Readout 29 March 2016)
- “Everything in the military is figure it out on your own unless you find someone who's done it before and who cares about you.” - Codi (V05) (VCRD Readout 29 March 2016)
- “My HealtheVet and eBenefits in one? One can only pray for that. I will not get my hopes up...I have to log in to TriCare, prescription site, military pay stubs, My HealtheVet, eBenefits and private doctor- patient portals.” - Courtney (V07) (VCRD Readout 29 March 2016)
- “I updated my address in eBenefits, DEERS, and My HealtheVet but they kept sending my prescriptions to my old address.” - Chantile (R05) (VCRD Readout 29 March 2016)
- First and foremost, Veterans value a system that allows them to mange their claims and documents to the best of their ability. This management includes timely notifications, shortcuts to streamline frequent tasks, and secure messaging to receive answers on demand. Secondarily, Veterans see value in enhancing their profile so the VA can make relevant benefits recommendations. (VCRD Readout 29 March 2016 p85)
