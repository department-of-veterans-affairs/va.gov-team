# Profile team priorities through Q4 2022 (October - December)

### This is a draft and not ready to share with the team.

## Wins in Q3 2022 (July - September 2022)

We did a lot, including:

- Launched bad address indicator functionality
- Re-integrate military information through VA Profile
- Launched a modal that asks if you want to update your mailing address when you update your home address
- Restricted character set for address fields to certain alphabetic and alphanumeric characters
- Updated A TON of documentation

...and much, much more that is still ongoing. Great work, team!

## Continuing and upcoming work for Q4 2022 

### Accessibility updates

We will tackle the accessibility issues that have been piling up over the last couple of years, and set up the profile for further growth in a way that is accessibility-friendly.

**Anticipated launch**: TBD

### Notifications preferences updates

As we anticipate eventually needing to add the 1095B preference and the MyHealtheVet preferences in 2023, we are going to need to make the following changes to notification preferences to better support those updates:

- Add the ability to detect default opt-in
- Move to a read-only/edit model for preferences (note: we can talk about whether this is single-page editing or not) 

**Anticipated launch**: TBD
