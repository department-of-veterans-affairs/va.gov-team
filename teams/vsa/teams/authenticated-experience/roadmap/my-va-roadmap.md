## Priorities

1. Elevate action items on My VA (Note: An action item is something a veteran needs to do while on VA.gov to apply for/track/manage benefits)
2. Show benefit status by continuing to integrate health/benefit information into My VA in a curated way

## Requests from other teams

|Project|Initiating team|Date of request| Status/Notes|
|----|----|----|----|
|"Ask VA" inquiry about "itegrating" with Notification Center| Ask VA team (AVA team)| June 16, 2023 | [Slack thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C909ZG2BB/p1686941696344349) - they're a new team, going to circle back with us in mid-July| 
|Check-in Experience| Ming Ligh/Patrick Bateman | Original request: 5.24.21 Update from Patrick: 11.17.21 | Ming said the following via DM in Slack: "When you are ready to include any pre-appointment task on MyVA, the Check In Experience team would probably like to talk you about it. We have not done any discovery in this areas so would be great to combine efforts. Patrick Bateman is working on Check In Experience. Update from Patrick makes it sounds like they aren't sure if My VA will need to be involved, but that's TBD: "we want the veteran to encounter that health form during the larger check in transaction and don't believe they will just happen across an alert that takes them there [to My VA]." He also mentioned they are still far from delivering online form experiences. |
|Updates related to unauth homepage updates | Dave Conlon | Nov 2021 | We know this work is coming down the pipeline, we just don't know exactly when or what will be needed from us. |
|Updates related to health apartment | Tracey Mulrooney | Nov 2021 |  We know this work is coming down the pipeline, we just don't know exactly when or what will be needed from us. |
|Add decision letters for claims & appeals|Benefits team 1/Skyler Schain|8.29.22|The team that manages claims & appeals is starting research on adding decision letters to VA.gov. Skyler reached out with interest about getting this information on My VA as part of that work.|

## Ideas from our team

|Project|Date of request| Notes| Status|
|----|----|----|----|
|Benefit application drafts | Summer 2023 | Inquiries from different teams led the team to realize our documentation for this section was not as clear is it could be  <br /><br />- [Veteran facing forms team - slack thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C909ZG2BB/p1686599083929699), as a result a form was added to the section, "form 21p-0847" <br />- [NOD and supplemental claims forms via Robin G - slack thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C909ZG2BB/p1686065298385539) <br />- Going to have the team do a review of our documentation around that section to indicate when and how a form appears there; and which forms currently appear there (see [#60510](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/60510)) | Backlog [ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/60510)|
| Expansion of education section| Spring 2023 | As a result of [My VA audit UX improvements UAT study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2022-audit/UAT/findings-summary.md), it was [recommended](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2022-audit/UAT/findings-summary.md#recommendations) we expand the education and training section to include education benefits that do not fall under the post-9/11 GI bill. We should do some discovery work, talk to other teams, poke around GH to gather info on other types of education benefits and see how/if we can incorporate that into My VA education and training section. ([Slack thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C909ZG2BB/p1682011499974139)) | Backlog [ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/59636)|
|Should we/how can we add letters and dependent info?| - | 'letters' and 'dependents' are top searches on My VA now that we've added links to other popular functionality (eg. payment info). They are also top searches across the site. How can we elevate this info on My VA? Links? Something else? | | 
|Should we communicate health care application updates?| N/A | This would be an extension of the [duplicate health care application status](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/product/181023hcachanges.md) work. On the old My VA, we showed people's health care application status. For reasons, we removed this from My VA 2.0, though the most important part of the project/info still lives in the health care application itself. However, this would be GREAT information to email to people and might be something the HCA team could work on with VANotify. Idk that auth experience would do this work, but tracking it here so I don't forget.|
|Update layout to put status updates separate from task links | Winter 2022 | We will evaluate this through a research effort. |
