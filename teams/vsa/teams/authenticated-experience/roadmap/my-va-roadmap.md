## Potential future projects & feature requests from other teams

### Higher priority

These are considered high priority because other teams are actively planning development and My VA is a dependency.

|Project|Initiating team|Date of request| Status/Notes|
|----|----|----|----|
|Updates re: user roles/permissions/delegation| Identity team | N/A - no formal request yet | There may be necessary My VA updates as a result of adding user roles/permissions/delegation, but nothing concrete has been defined yet |

### Potential future projects & feature requests from other teams

|Project|Initiating team|Date of request| Status/Notes|
|----|----|----|----|
|My VA: Post-launch updates and enhancements | Auth exp. | N/A | We'd like to continue making small, incremental updates to My VA based on analytics data and small experiments.|
|How do we communicate health care application updates?| Auth exp | N/A | This would be an extension of the [duplicate health care application status](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/product/181023hcachanges.md) work. On the old My VA, we showed people's health care application status. For reasons, we removed this from My VA 2.0, though the most important part of the project/info still lives in the health care application itself. However, this would be GREAT information to email to people and might be something the HCA team could work on with VANotify. Idk that auth experience would do this work, but tracking it here so I don't forget.|
|Debt notifications| Leah Keeler/Benefits & Memorials team|3.1.21| The debt team would like to elevate debt-related notifications on the My VA dashboard. However, the My VA notification is not a dependency for this team's launch. They are able to continue develoment on their tool while we finish the My VA 2.0 design.
