## Priorities

1. Elevate action items on My VA (Note: An action item is something a veteran needs to do while on VA.gov to apply for/track/manage benefits)
2. Show benefit status by continuing to integrate health/benefit information into My VA in a curated way

## Requests from other teams

|Project|Initiating team|Date of request| Status/Notes|
|----|----|----|----|
|Check-in Experience| Ming Ligh/Patrick Bateman | Original request: 5.24.21 Update from Patrick: 11.17.21 | Ming said the following via DM in Slack: "When you are ready to include any pre-appointment task on MyVA, the Check In Experience team would probably like to talk you about it. We have not done any discovery in this areas so would be great to combine efforts. Patrick Bateman is working on Check In Experience. Update from Patrick makes it sounds like they aren't sure if My VA will need to be involved, but that's TBD: "we want the veteran to encounter that health form during the larger check in transaction and don't believe they will just happen across an alert that takes them there [to My VA]." He also mentioned they are still far from delivering online form experiences. |
|Updates related to unauth homepage updates | Dave Conlon | Nov 2021 | We know this work is coming down the pipeline, we just don't know exactly when or what will be needed from us. |
|Updates related to health apartment | Tracey Mulrooney | Nov 2021 |  We know this work is coming down the pipeline, we just don't know exactly when or what will be needed from us. |

## Ideas from our team

|Project|Initiating team|Date of request| Status/Notes|
|----|----|----|----|
|Should we communicate health care application updates?| Auth exp | N/A | This would be an extension of the [duplicate health care application status](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/product/181023hcachanges.md) work. On the old My VA, we showed people's health care application status. For reasons, we removed this from My VA 2.0, though the most important part of the project/info still lives in the health care application itself. However, this would be GREAT information to email to people and might be something the HCA team could work on with VANotify. Idk that auth experience would do this work, but tracking it here so I don't forget.|
|Redirect from homepage to My VA at login| N/A | Winter 2022 | We will be evaluating this after the payment information section goes out. |
|Update layout to put status updates separate from task links | N/A | Winter 2022 | We will evaluate this through a research effort. |
