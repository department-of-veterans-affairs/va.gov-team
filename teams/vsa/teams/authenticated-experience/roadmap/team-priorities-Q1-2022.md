# Auth. experience team priorities through Q1 2022 (January - March) 

## My VA 

### [Add payment information to My VA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/payment-history/discovery-and-research/README.md)

People have mentioned that seeing payment info on their My VA dashboard is a high priority since our [initial dashboard discovery in 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#for-those-interested-in-education-benefits-gi-bill-balance-and-payment-information-was-most-important), and again in later research sessions, including during [December 2020 exploration research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/product/Research/MyVA-research-findings.md#additional-insights), [March 2021 usability testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/product/Research%20V2/MyVA2-research-findings.md#features-users-expected-to-see-that-were-missing), and [July 2021 notifications discovery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#for-those-interested-in-education-benefits-gi-bill-balance-and-payment-information-was-most-important). The importance of payment information also bears out in analytics. Viewing payments is [a top interaction on VA.gov overall](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-event-events/a50123418w177519031p184624291/_u.date00=20201122&_u.date01=20211121&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.rowCount=50&_r.drilldown=analytics.eventCategory:Interactions/), and "Payments" is  [a top search from the My VA dashboard](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/product/post-2.0-redesign-analytics.md#searches). This effort aims to add payment information to the My VA dashboard and to determine if any other financial information should be elevated as well.

**Targeted launch**: End of Q1/beginning of Q2 2022

### Additional work

We are aware there may need to be updates to My VA as a result of the following projects, but we do not have definite timelines or scope at this time:

- Updates to My VA based on health care apartment needs
- Updates to My VA based on the homepage redesign 

## On-site notifications

### [MVP build](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/notifications/vagov-notifications/mvp/README.md)

In addition to emails and text messages, on-site notifications are part of a cross-platform strategy to get important action items & alerts in front of VA.gov users. This effort aims to create the first on-site notification powered by the VANotify platform.

**Targeted launch**: End of Q1/beginning of Q2 2022

## Profile

### [Update personal information section of the profile: Add LGBTQ data points](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/personal-information/personal-information-revision/README.md)

We are integrating preferred name, pronouns, gender identity, and sexual orientation into the VA.gov profile as part of a request from VEO and the LGBTQ Health Services office. This effort will allow veterans to more accurately define themselves within the VA, and it will help mitigate issues around veterans showing up to health appointments and being addressed improperly.

**Targeted launch**: End of Q1 2022

### Additional work

We are currently talking to VA Profile, VANotify, and VEText to figure out what is next for the notification preferences feature that just launched, but we are not sure what those are at this point. We'll work with these teams as necessary to figure out process for incorporating new preferences.
