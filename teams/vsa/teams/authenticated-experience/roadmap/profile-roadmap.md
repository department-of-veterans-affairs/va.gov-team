# Backlog & feature requests

### General profile requests & updates

|Project|Initiating team|Date of request| Status/Notes|
|----|----|----|----|
|Fiduciary indicator | VA Profile | N/A | VA Profile has mentioned they are in discovery with adding a fiduciary indicator that we could consume, but they do not have any dates yet as to when they plan to implement this |
|Add dependent info to the profile | Auth exp/eBenefits migration team | January 2021 | [Slack convo](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CLY6Q69RV/p1611687078020800)|
|Virtual hearing opt-in| Caseflow/Lighthouse | September 2020 | Caseflow/Lighthouse needs to do some research to determine how virtual hearing opt-in might work before coming back to VA.gov. Currently, there is no evidence that the profile is the right place for people to indicate they are willing to do a virtual appeals hearing.|
|Integrate MHV profile data points into VA.gov profile | MHV | 2.10.21 | MHV would like to point all of their users to VA.gov instead of maintaining their own profile. Active converstions with VA.gov and VA Profile are beginning Feb 2021. |
| Design exploration: Should we move editing from in-line forms to forms on a different page? | Auth exp | Fall 2021 | [Additional context](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/31237#issuecomment-947856877)|

### Personal information requests

### Contact information requests

|Project|Initiating team|Date of request| Status/Notes|
|----|----|----|----|
| Integrate emergency contact, next of kin, and insurance information into the VA.gov profile | Ming/Caregivers/Check-in experience| 5.4.21 | Ming reached out about adding this info into the profile as part of the check-in experience work, but we agreed that it probably doesn't need to reflect in the profile for their MVP. However it likely should show and be updatable from there at some point in time.|
|Remove extension for non-work phone numbers | VA Profile |September 2020| We had some initial conversations about this with VA Profile, but it still hasn't gone anywhere|
|ZIP+4 – Updating zip code in the VA.gov profile to elevate the additional 4 digits | N/A | September 2020 | Steve K mentioned that a stakeholder had asked about this, but there's been no formal request. This already supported by VA Profile. |

### Military information requests

|Project|Initiating team|Date of request| Status/Notes|
|----|----|----|----|
|Link to DD214 info from Military information section of the profile| Auth exp| 2020| "DD214" is a top search term from the profile, indicating people expect to find this information here. [Ticket](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vft-59c95ae5fda7577a9b3184f8/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/11053) |
|Integrate "Military information" section of the profile through VA Profile backend| VA Profile | September 2020 | Update from 4.30.21 meeting — Military data — VA Profile is still working on this, but nothing ready for us to work with yet. Working on roadmap for this. Erin or Rebecca could provide further information. Integrating service periods will be considered for their next PI planning (starting mid May 2021).|
|Enhanced statement of service | George Chewning | Summer 2021 | George and Samara agree that we need more research to determine what updates to military information on VA.gov would be the most useful. We are currently trying to determine how to get funding for this work. Potential research questions: (1) How do people use/when do people need their DD214 when interacting with the VA? (2) Are there certain pieces of information from the DD214 it would be especially helpful to reflect on VA.gov that we don't support now (eg. discharge status)? (3) What military data would it be helpful to have on VA.gov to support predictive benefit eligibility?|

### Direct deposit requests

|Project|Initiating team|Date of request| Status/Notes|
|----|----|----|----|
|Show direct deposit section persistently for all users| Auth exp|3.3.22| This suggestion is based on Medallia survey feedback of people saying they should hace direct deposit in their profile but it's not showing up. It sounds like we are somehow not able to detect their direct deposit info. While persistently showing the tab would not entirely solve the problem, it would at least stop people from searching around for this section|

### Notification preferences requests

|Project|Initiating team|Date of request| Status/Notes|
|----|----|----|----|
|Establish governance process for adding new preferences | Auth exp | - | We need to figure out a process to review planned updates for notification preferences so new preferences don't end up in our UI without having been reviewed and tested (if needed) by our team |
|Add default opt-in functionality | VA Profile | January 2022 | We need functionality that tells us if a person is receiving a notification by default without having explicitly opted in themselves so we can reflect this in the profile. This is currently being worked on by VA Profile.|
|Add notification preferences currently in eBenefits| Melissa Rebstock|2.11.22| Melissa Rebstock said there are notification preferences currently managed in eBenefits that need to move over to VA.gov. I explained that we need to first get VA Profile and VANotify on board before making any changes in VA.gov, so that process should start soon with a launch date of no later than Oct 2022.|
