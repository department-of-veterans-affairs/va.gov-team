**Last updated November 23, 2021**

The authenticated experience team works on two sections of the website:

## My VA dashboard

The My VA dashboard provides Veterans with insight into the status of their benefits at the VA. It elevates critical tasks and updates based on their unique circumstances.  

## On-site notifications

In addition to emails and text messages, on-site notifications are part of a cross-platform strategy to get important action items & alerts in front of VA.gov users.

## VA.gov Profile

The VA.gov profile is a section of the website that allows veterans to view and update the information that VA knows about them. Products that currently live in the profle include:

- Personal information
- Contact information
- Military information
- Direct deposit information
- Notification preferences
- Account security
- Connected apps (**Note**: This integration is managed by the lighthouse team. Our team only manages minor updates to the UI as needed.)
