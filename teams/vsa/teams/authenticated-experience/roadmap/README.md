The My VA dashboard provides Veterans with insight into the status of their benefits at the VA. It elevates critical tasks and updates based on their unique circumstances.  

## On-site notifications

In addition to emails and text messages, on-site notifications are part of a cross-platform strategy to get important action items & alerts in front of VA.gov users.

## VA.gov Profile

- Personal information
- Contact information
