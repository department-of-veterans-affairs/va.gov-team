# 2023 roadmapping

### This is a draft document which is not ready to be shared with the team. Information in here may change drastically as we gather details from other teams.

The following are the priorities that were discussed at the October 2022 OCTO offsite for 2023 that will or might require work from the authenticated experience team:

## Integrate health portal features into VA.gov

Potential projects and work for our team includes:

- Incorporating notification preferences for health features that will be integrated in 2023
  - Potential features: Secure messaging and medical records
- Updating My VA to accommodate new features
  - This could be as small as updating links, or as big as adding new modules

### What we know now

It is unlikely that we will need to launch any changes to the notification preferences section of the profile until Q4 CY2023 at the earliest. [From Lauren via Slack on 10/26/22](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C02BTDTEPNH/p1666797451568699?thread_ts=1666728785.285899&cid=C02BTDTEPNH):

> I would love to be in a place where both appointments and medical records are in phase 2 by this time next year. Stretch goal - pharmacy and secure messages in Phase 0 or 1.

So, while we don't want to wait to start development until then, we likely won't need to work on this in Q1 CY2023. This is something that the team should start visiting with VA Profile and MHV no later than CY Q2 2023 so that preferences are ready and waiting for when they are needed.

## Improve the Veteran login experience

Potential projects and work for our team includes:

- Updating both the profile and My VA to account for a delegate experience.

### What we know now

[Via Slack on 10/26/22 and 10/27/22](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/G9TV2B50E/p1666828006560949?thread_ts=1666795077.350119&cid=G9TV2B50E):

- There is a product team that is tasked with helping to define what a delegate is and broad requirements for managing that on VA.gov.
- Each VA.gov team is responsible for updating and maintaining their sections accordingly, though the main product team will act as coordinators and liaisons with whoever is helping them define the delegate use case.
- Timing on this is unclear. Definition is in its early phases, so I don't anticipate we'll work on this in the first couple of quarters of CY2023.

Meeting with John Rahagi on 11.7.22:

- Confirmed that it is unlikely our team will work on this in first two CY quarters of 2023, so I am not considering this in our first-quarter roadmap.
- Check back in on this before maternity leave in case work needs to start while I am out.

## Refresh the VA.gov homepage and information architecture

Potential projects and work for our team includes:

- Research and/or design work with Mikki around creating a more holistic logged-in experience

### What we know now

Via a biweekly sync with Mikki on 11/30:

- The next step with IA work is the wayfinding research that's happening through the health apartment effort. This will be heavily informed by Mikki's treejack testing she did earlier this year.
- Wayfinding research will need to be a cross-team effort. Mikki's vision includes building a prototype that reconciles the homepage, My VA, and health landing pages to see where and how people expect to find information and where they get confused. This may involve someone from our team needing to mockup or modify designs. Unclear to me if our team would need to be involved in moderating research or not.
- I think this has potential for work for our team in Q1CY2023.

## Enhance Veterans' personalized online experience

### Work that is happening now and will continue into the new year

- Persistently showing all sections of My VA and simplifying personalized logic (aka My VA audit updates)

### Work that is definitely happening but hasn't started

- Scaling on-site notifications (Notifications V2)

### Potential projects that we may or may not work on

- Ongoing maintenance and updates to notification preferences, either health apartment-related or not
- Adding "pronouns" and "sexual orientation" to the VA.gov profile **if** those fields get PRA approval
- Adding new fields to the military information section of the profile to support PACT Act ([Details](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/G03HQ55DC/p1667569982198959))
