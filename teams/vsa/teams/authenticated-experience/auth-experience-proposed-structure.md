# Authenticated experience: Proposed future vision

**Last updated: January 24, 2023**

## Problems 

- Technically, VA.gov does have an authenticated experience -- people can login to the website and access personalized tools. However, I would argue we are currently heavier on "authenticated" and lighter on "experience." Logged-in, the site largely feels the same as it does logged-out. 
- With the exception of My VA and a few minor navigational changes, most tools are buried in content pages. There is very little that provides a guided, structured experience that says to users, "this is a logged-in portal to manage your health care and benefits with VA."
- OCTO has historically treated the My VA dashboard as *the* authenticated experience. My VA is a page, not a whole experience. Expecting it to do the lifting for the entire logged-in experience opens it to becoming a dumping ground instead of a curated part of a larger experience.
- The profile half of the authenticated experience team has, historically, needed to integrate many features from other VA tools or systems into the VA.gov website. However, as some of these tools move into more of a maintenance mode, our team is left with some open bandwidth.

## Proposal

The authenticated experience team should move into a role more fitting of our name -- working with teams across VA.gov to create an actual logged-in experience, one that meets our goal of being on par with private-sector tools and experiences.

### Current responsibilities

Currently, our portfolio is solely focused on the continued developement of individual products. Focusing on individual products reflects the way we've been set up across VA.gov for some years now:

|My VA team||Profile team|
|----------|-|-----------|
|My VA dashboard||Personal information|
|Onsite notifications|| Contact information|
|||Military information|
|||Direct deposit information|
|||Notification preferences|
|||Account security|
|||Connected apps (frontend only)|

### Future responsibilities

Going forward, our team **should be responsible for the following**:

- **Aggregating** personalized information across VA.gov.
- **Connecting** with different teams to create unified logged-in experiences across tools. 
- **Implementing** proposed updates and changes to tools and experiences within our purview.
- **Maintenance** of any current integrations we manage.
  - However, it may make sense for other teams to take on these tools depending on how the larger VA.gov team and logged-in experience ebbs and flows over time (eg. direct deposit might make more sense to be maintained by a "financials" team).

Over time, we would ideally **would NOT be responsible for the following**:

- **Integrating** new backends and tools into VA.gov. 
- Taking on management from other teams of existing backend integrations (eg. taking over work from the debt team).

Comparing to our old structure, a new structure might look like this. Initially, responsibilities might be divided across similar team lines that we have now (My VA/Profile), but over time, those lines would likely become less important, and team members would work on a variety of issues that support the broader authenticated experience.

|Authenticated experience areas of focus| |Maintenance and development only as needed|
|---------------------------------------|-|--------------------|
|My VA dashboard|| Personal information|
|Onsite notifications/notification center||Contact information|
|Logged-in IA and navigation (in partnership with Mikki and larger portfolio)||Military information|
|Elevating personalized information across the logged-in experience||Direct deposit information|
|Providing consistency to logged-in tool page structure ||Notification preferences|
|||Account security|
|||Connected apps (frontend only)|

## Impacts to VA.gov

- **Thinking across portfolios and tools** - Our teams have historically been structured around specific products. However, VA.gov is in a position where we both are ready to and need to do more thinking across products and tools to meet user needs and expectations and keep VA.gov maintainable and scalable over time. Our team can serve as the glue in the logged-in space.
- **Focus in roadmapping**: Without a clear stakeholder request or need, the challenge with roadmapping for the authenticated experience team has always been balancing what we *could* do vs. what we *should* do. I will use the proposed areas of focus to help prioritize our roadmap. Of course, roadmapping will consider and prioritize broader organizational needs (eg. health apartment migration), but this new vision will bring greater focus into how we might spend our time absent high-priority stakeholder requests.
- **Clarity around leveraging our team**: These proposed areas of focus will help OCTO and the broader VA.gov team to better leverage the authenticated experience portfolio in the future. This will help us determine which areas are in scope and which areas are out of scope for our team.
