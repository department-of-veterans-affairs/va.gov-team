# Ideas, Goals, and Future Work

- TAP
  - Research TAP and figure out where there are opportunities for improvement
- Benefit eligibility
  - Recommend the discharge wizard to anyone who has a less than honorable discharge. https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/14610#issuecomment-433453162
  - Recommend benefits based on personlized info
    - MVP: Ask people what benefits they want to learn about
    - Future: potential wizard functionality to get to specific content
    - Future: Pull in info we know about veterans to make recommendations based on that
â€“ Enrollment data
  - Add enrollment information for healthcare (goal: to reduce duplicate applications)
  - Add enrollment data for all benefits 
    - (note: still need to figure out how to get this for benefits besides healthcare and education)
- Dashboard 2.0
- Profile updates re: Cerner/MHV and reconciling profiles across these tools
- Order hearing aids and prosthetics (cf. eBen feature)
