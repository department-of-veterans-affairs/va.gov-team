# Launch Playbook
This will be where we will house documents that will lay the foundation for launching new products or features from within Authenticated Experience to VA.gov.  
See [checklist.md](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/authenticated-experience/folder/launch-playbook/checklist.md) for a list of things to check before launch or as devleopment progresses.  
See [tickets.md](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/authenticated-experience/folder/launch-playbook/tickets.md) for a list of commonly created tickets.  

_Both are WIP and if you have any suggestions, please contact Justin Pickett (@Justin Pickett in Slack)_
