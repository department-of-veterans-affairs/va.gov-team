# Authenticated experience intake form

`DRAFT`

## Our Team 

Before you submit an intake ticket, we want to make sure you’re in the right place. 

The Authenticated Experience team has two main products My VA and Profile. Profile is the frontend used to allow users to update important information. My VA is a dashboard that seeks to surface relevant, actionable, time sensitive information to veterans about different VA benefits. We’re not VA Profile, the backend system does support us but is a different team. We’re not MyHealtheVet as our products support many different benefits, not exclusively healthcare. 

If you’re still here after our little explainer we’d like to know more about your project!
