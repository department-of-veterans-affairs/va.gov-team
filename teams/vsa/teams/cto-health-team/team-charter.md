## Why we're here

### Executive Summary:
Our mission to simplify Veterans’ health experience on the web by consolidating all health things into a single health “home” on VA.gov. As we consolidate the health experience, we will work closely with the "classic" My HealtheVet / Office of Connected Care (OCC) and with teams throughout OCTO.

### Mission:

### Vision

### Sprint board columns

As of 08/25/2020, the current columns on our sprint board columns are 

| Column |Description| 
|:--:| :-- |
|**Icebox**	|Tasks here are nice to haves, blue sky ideas, or ideas that need more thought. These tasks may or may not be well defined and not estimated. Usually, big idea task will start here|
|**Epics**|	Epics are high-level tasks. These have details, and. are usually well defined. Epics have subtasks that run through the process. An epic is closed when all the subtasks are closed|
|**Backlog**|	The backlog is the holding pen for tasks. This column contains tickets that are a granular task that is well defined, but may or may not be estimated yet. A new task is usually created and stored here. Even if pointed we should use backlog to hold pointed tickets until sprint planning or we are confident that it should go in upcoming sprint.  |
|**Ready**|	Ready tickets are tickets that come from the backlog. Once a Backlog ticket is estimated, it gets moved into the Ready column. These tickets are ready to go (well defined, estimated, approved by the team), but not in any current sprint.|
|**Current Sprint**	|These tickets are taken from the Ready column and are queued to be completed in the current sprint. This is the "to do" column for the current sprint.|
|**In Progress**|	These tickets represent the work that is going on currently. Active work (development, documentation, etc) should be reflected in a ticket in this column. This is one of the few columns that every ticket should be in at one point. A ticket's assignee should be putting notes and updates on currently worked on tickets.|
|**Blocked**|	Tickets in the blocked column can not be worked on for some reason. That reason should be documented on the ticket, and if a ticket exists that fixes that blocker, that ticket should be linked.|
|**Validate**|	This column represents tickets that no longer being actively worked on, but are going through some review process. This review process can be, but not limited to, meetings or code reviews.|
|**Closed**|	These tickets are complete and are confirmed to be completed.|

#### Program Increment Planning
We participate in PI planning with the "classic" My HealtheVet teams doing work for OCC.  These are 3.5 day sessions typically held in March, June, September, and December.  The organizer for that group will send out invitations several weeks prior.  

We have created a [PI Planning board in ZenHub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/mhv-to-vagov-cto-team-pi-10-integration-planning-board-63a31dce3fe3310026840f42/board) on which we list each person's capacity for a given sprint, and use to plan work out for the PI.  This board can filtered by assignee to compare assigned work to capacity.  It can be re-used for each new PI by updating the PI number, dates, sprint numbers, team members, and their capacity.

#### Sprint Planning
Outline work to be done this sprint in order to accomplish the team's goals

- Monday before the start of each sprint @2PM ET
- 1 hour

#### Backlog Refinement
Assess and update workload for remainder of sprint

- 2nd Monday of every sprint @ 2PM ET
- 1 hour
- [Zenhub: MHV on VA.gov Top-Level View](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/mhv-on-vagov-top-level-view-62619a987d74510018ecc546/board?repos=133843125)

##### Issue Estimates

| Point | Task Size | Approx Days/hours | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Easy  | ~1-2 days / ~8-16 hrs | Work is known, can be executed quickly |
| 2 | Small | ~2-3 days / ~16-24 hrs | Work is known, and can be completed with minimal hours |
| 3 | Medium | ~3-4 days / ~24-48 hrs | Work is known, and can be completed in a couple days |
| 5 | Large  | ~5 days / ~40 hrs | Work is known and can be completed in half a sprint | 
| 8 | XLarge | ~6-8 days/ ~40-60 hrs | Work is complex and/or there might be unknown factors that need to be discussed prior to planning. Once further information is known, attempt to brake down into smaller tasks that can be completed in a sprint with certantity. |
| 13 | XXLarge |  | Very complex, needs discovery or prototype before it can be planned for a sprint. |

#### Retro

#### Team Norms
- Team crosses all US time zones so core business/meeting hours are 12-4PM ET.
- When planning meetings, we check others' calendars for availability.  If a time cannot be found, we ask folks to provide their availability using [When2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/), or if there are only a few time slots to choose from, we put it to a [vote in Slack using reaction emojies](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C03ECSBGSKX/p1660768928334879).

#### Slack:
- Slack is the primary form of communication for the team outside meetings.  Please thread replies, and @ the folks you need to provide info to, or need feedback from. [#mhv-on-vagov-portal-home](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C04GDQSHD1R)

#### GitHub
- [products/healthcare/questionnaires/](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/questionnaire)
- [Github/Zenhub labels - my-health-INTEGRATION + my-health](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/mhv-on-vagov-top-level-view-62619a987d74510018ecc546/board?repos=133843125) -- all work related to MHV on VA.gov needs the `my-health` label, and `my-health-INTEGRATION` label denotes the work being done by the CTO Health Team
