# CTO Health Team - Team Charter

## Why we're here

### Executive Summary:
Veterans and their caregivers have a single, trusted, intuitive, and fully accessible place to go to manage their VA health care. The My HealtheVet portal on VA.gov will make it easier for all Veterans to find, understand, and use the tools they need to manage their health, their care, and all their VA benefits. This will lead to increased health outcomes for Veterans—and increased trust in VA.As we consolidate the health experience, we will work closely with the "classic" My HealtheVet / Office of Connected Care (OCC) and with teams throughout OCTO.

### Mission:

... is to deliver personalized experiences that support collaboration and create a seamless health and well-being journey

### Vision

... to meet users where they are and empower them with tools that exceed expectations
  1. accessibility
  2. partner in collaboration
  3. be delightful 

### North Star
Reduce the time it takes for a Veteran to achieve an outcome through self-service means.

## How we work

### Workflow + Cadence
 - 2 week sprints (start every other Thursday)
   
#### Stand-up
- Check in on people and sprint goal progress
- 3 Question Format: What I accomplished yesterday? What will I accomplish today? Any impediments?
- Slack Up every Tuesday, Zoom meeting M/W/Th/F @ 12:00 PM ET

##### Zoom Stand-up 
- 15 minutes with 16 minute discussion after if needed. Folks can drop off after stand up.
- 16 minute immediately following to discuss non-stand up topics, problem solve, etc.

### Sprint board columns

As of 4/1/2024, the current columns on our sprint board columns are:

| Column |Description| 
|:--:| :-- |
|**Icebox**	|Default status when a new issue is created. Low priority Issues that do not need to be addressed in the near future.|
|**Epics**|	Group issues into epics to easily track long-term goals.|
|**Backlog**|	New issues that have not been broken down or estimated. |
|**Ready**|	Issues that have been assigned, estimated, prioritized, and are ready to be worked on.|
|**Current Sprint**	|Issues ready to be worked on in the sprint, prioritized top-to-bottom.|
|**In Progress**|	Issue is being worked on by one or more team members.|
|**Blocked**|	Issues that have dependencies or are otherwise blocked from being completed.|
|**Review/QA**|	Issue is in review - inside and/or outside of the team. The work is complete but undergoing a second set of eyes and/or stakeholder approval.|
|**Closed**| Issue is complete & merged.|

<br/>

#### Program Increment Planning
Since our work is closely related, the DM and PM may attend PI planning with the My HealtheVet National Portal teams doing work for OCC.  These are 3.5 day sessions typically held in March, June, September, and December.  The organizer for that activity will send out invitations several weeks prior.  As our team members shift, the PO or PM should let the organizer know to add/remove people.

- Wednesday before the start of each sprint @ 2PM ET
- 2 hours 

#### Backlog Refinement
Assess and update workload for remainder of sprint

##### Issue Estimates

| Point | Task Size | Complexity | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Easy  | Very Simple | No unknowns, very specific, no dependiencies, can be executed quickly (a day or less) |
| 2 | Small | Simple | Very specific, relatively trivial but may take longer than a day to complete, like a 1 but may have other tasks  or dependencies that take more time.|
| 3 | Medium | Average | May be some unknowns, not easy but we've done this king of work in the past, there may be 2-3 closely related tasks, each of which is simple, and I can fit this task in my head at one time.|
| 5 | Large  | Complex | We have to learn some new things but are confident in how long that would take. May be cognitively demanding work, like synthesis. Small group of closely related tasks that cannot be separated.| 
| 8 | XLarge | Very Complex | Some unknowns, hard to tell how much work will be involved from the start. Large group of related tasks that may be able to be separated.|
| 13 | XXLarge | Very Complex | Cannot be completed in one sprint by one person, needs multiple people. May need discovery before it can be planned for a sprint. Should be broke down unless there is a good reason not to. |

Most of the team's tickets are larger initiatives that include tasks from multiple disciplines (engineering, design, research, QA). When estimating these tickets, typically team members estimate only for their discipline's work. To get the estimate for the entire ticket, add the discipline estimates and assign it the nearest fibonacci value. 

#### Retrospective
Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, what can be improved, what questions people have, and any action/improvement items

- Every other Thursday @ 1:05 PM ET
- 60 minutes

#### Sprint Demo
Review and demonstrate accomplishments and work completed. 

- Every other Wednesday @ 1:05 PM ET
- 45 minutes
- Link to sprint demo recordings: VA network SharePoint site

#### Team Norms
- Team crosses all US time zones so core business/meeting hours are 12-4PM ET.
- We work out in the open with transparency as much as possible
- When planning meetings, we check others' calendars for availability.  

#### Team Values
- We value everyone's wellness and need for a healthy work-life balance.
- Communication and collaboration
- Action over discussion
- Ask for help when needed - from your team members as well as OCTO.
- Making a difference and providing value to veterans.
