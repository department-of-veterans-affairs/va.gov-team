# CTO Health Team - Team Charter

## Why we're here

### Executive Summary:
Veterans and their caregivers have a single, trusted, intuitive, and fully accessible place to go to manage their VA health care. The My HealtheVet portal on VA.gov will make it easier for all Veterans to find, understand, and use the tools they need to manage their health, their care, and all their VA benefits. This will lead to increased health outcomes for Veteransâ€”and increased trust in VA.As we consolidate the health experience, we will work closely with the "classic" My HealtheVet / Office of Connected Care (OCC) and with teams throughout OCTO.

### Mission:

... is to deliver personalized experiences that support collaboration and create a seamless health and well-being journey

### Vision

... to meet users where they are and empower them with tools that exceed expectations
  1. accessibility
  2. partner in collaboration
  3. be delightful 

### North Star
Reduce the time it takes for a Veteran to achieve an outcome through self-service means.

## How we work

### Workflow + Cadence
 - 2 week sprints (start every other Tuesday)
   
#### Stand-up
- Check in on people and sprint goal progress
- 3 Question Format: What I accomplished yesterday? What will I accomplish today? Any impediments?

##### Zoom Stand-up 
- Daily @ 12:00 PM ET
- 15 minutes with parking lot after if needed. Folks can drop off after stand up.
- We sometimes opt to have a Slack-up if most of the team unavailable.
- Parking lot immediately following to discuss non-stand up topics, problem solve, etc.

### Sprint board columns

As of 4/4/2023, the current columns on our sprint board columns are:

| Column |Description| 
|:--:| :-- |
|**Icebox**	|Tasks here are nice to haves, blue sky ideas, or ideas that need more thought. These tasks may or may not be well defined and not estimated. Usually, big idea task will start here|
|**Epics**|	Epics are high-level tasks. These have details, and. are usually well defined. Epics have subtasks that run through the process. An epic is closed when all the subtasks are closed|
|**Backlog**|	The backlog is the holding pen for tasks. This column contains tickets that are a granular task that is well defined, but may or may not be estimated yet. A new task is usually created and stored here. Even if pointed we should use backlog to hold pointed tickets until sprint planning or we are confident that it should go in upcoming sprint. Before being estimated or worked on, all tickets must have tasks and acceptance criteria defined. |
|**Ready**|	Ready tickets are tickets that come from the backlog. Once a Backlog ticket is estimated, it gets moved into the Ready column. These tickets are ready to go (well defined, estimated, approved by the team), but not in any current sprint.|
|**Current Sprint**	|These tickets are taken from the Ready column and are queued to be completed in the current sprint. This is the "to do" column for the current sprint.|
|**In Progress**|	These tickets represent the work that is going on currently. Active work (development, documentation, etc) should be reflected in a ticket in this column. This is one of the few columns that every ticket should be in at one point. A ticket's assignee should be putting notes and updates on currently worked on tickets.|
|**Blocked**|	Tickets in the blocked column can not be worked on for some reason. That reason should be documented on the ticket, and if a ticket exists that fixes that blocker, that ticket should be linked.|
|**Validate**|	This column represents tickets that no longer being actively worked on, but are going through some review process. This review process can be, but not limited to, meetings or code reviews.|
|**Closed**|	These tickets are complete and are confirmed to be completed.|

#### Program Increment Planning
Since our work is closely related, we may attend PI planning with the My HealtheVet National Portal teams doing work for OCC.  These are 3.5 day sessions typically held in March, June, September, and December.  The organizer for that activity will send out invitations several weeks prior.  As our team members shift, the PO or PM should let the organizer know to add/remove people.

We have created a [PI Planning board in ZenHub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/mhv-to-vagov-cto-team-pi-10-integration-planning-board-63a31dce3fe3310026840f42/board) on which we list each person's capacity for a given sprint, then use it to plan work out for the PI.  This board can filtered by assignee to compare assigned work to their capacity.  This board can be re-used for each new PI by updating the PI number, dates, sprint numbers, team members, and their capacity (typically calculated as 8 points per sprint minus one point for each day of planned time off).

#### Sprint Planning
Outline work to be done this sprint in order to accomplish the team's goals.

- Monday before the start of each sprint @ 2PM ET
- 1.25 hours 

#### Backlog Refinement
Assess and update workload for remainder of sprint

- 1st Monday of every sprint @ 2 PM ET
- 1.25 hours
- [Zenhub: MHV on VA.gov Top-Level View](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/mhv-on-vagov-top-level-view-62619a987d74510018ecc546/board?repos=133843125)

##### Refinement Process
1. Thursday before refinement - A list of tickets to be refined will be sent in the team Slack channel. This gives the team time to become familiar with the tickets and develop questions/comments/suggestions for discussion.
2. During refinement - The team will discuss the listed tickets, addressing team members' questions/comments/suggestions.
3. After refinement - Point voting will be opened in the team Slack channel using the Poker Planner app.
   - Team members will vote on any tickets they are comfortable expressing an opinion on.
   - Voting will remain open until EOD the Wednesday follwing refinement to allow the team ample time to process discussion and form an opinion.
4. After voting, each ticket will be assigned the highest non-outlier point value from the voting in order to be conservative on capacity planning.
   - If follow-up discussions are needed for a ticket, those conversations will be done asynchronously in the team Slack channel among all those who voted on the ticket.

##### Issue Estimates

| Point | Task Size | Complexity | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Easy  | Very Simple | Work is known, can be executed quickly |
| 2 | Small | Simple | Work is known, and can be completed with minimal hours |
| 3 | Medium | Average | Work is known, and can be completed in a couple days |
| 5 | Large  | Complex | Work is known and can be completed in half a sprint | 
| 8 | XLarge | Very Complex | Work is complex and/or there might be unknown factors that need to be discussed prior to planning. Once further information is known, break down into smaller tickets that can be completed in a sprint with certantity. |
| 13 | XXLarge |  | Needs discovery or prototype before it can be planned for a sprint. If a story is estimated as 13, it should be broken down into smaller tickets that can be completed in the sprint. |

#### Retrospective
Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, what can be improved, what questions people have, and any action/improvement items

- Every other Tuesday @ 2:30 PM ET
- 60 minutes

#### Team Norms
- Team crosses all US time zones so core business/meeting hours are 12-4PM ET.
- We work out in the open with transparency as much as possible
- When planning meetings, we check others' calendars for availability.  If a time cannot be found, we ask folks to provide their availability using [When2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/), or if there are only a few time slots to choose from, we put it to a vote in Slack using reaction emojies - [example](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C03ECSBGSKX/p1660768928334879).

#### Team Values
- We value everyone's wellness and need for a healthy work-life balance.
- Communication and collaboration
- Action over discussion
- Ask for help when needed - from your team members as well as OCTO.
