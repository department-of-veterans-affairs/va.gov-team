# CTO Health Team - Team Charter

## Why we're here

### Executive Summary:
Veterans and their caregivers have a single, trusted, intuitive, and fully accessible place to go to manage their VA health care. The My HealtheVet portal on VA.gov will make it easier for all Veterans to find, understand, and use the tools they need to manage their health, their care, and all their VA benefits. This will lead to increased health outcomes for Veterans—and increased trust in VA.As we consolidate the health experience, we will work closely with the "classic" My HealtheVet / Office of Connected Care (OCC) and with teams throughout OCTO.

### Mission:

... is to deliver personalized experiences that support collaboration and create a seamless health and well-being journey

### Vision

... to meet users where they are and empower them with tools that exceed expectations
  1. accessibility
  2. partner in collaboration
  3. be delightful 

### North Star
Reduce the time it takes for a Veteran to achieve an outcome through self-service means.

### Sprint board columns

As of 4/4/2023, the current columns on our sprint board columns are:

| Column |Description| 
|:--:| :-- |
|**Icebox**	|Tasks here are nice to haves, blue sky ideas, or ideas that need more thought. These tasks may or may not be well defined and not estimated. Usually, big idea task will start here|
|**Epics**|	Epics are high-level tasks. These have details, and. are usually well defined. Epics have subtasks that run through the process. An epic is closed when all the subtasks are closed|
|**Backlog**|	The backlog is the holding pen for tasks. This column contains tickets that are a granular task that is well defined, but may or may not be estimated yet. A new task is usually created and stored here. Even if pointed we should use backlog to hold pointed tickets until sprint planning or we are confident that it should go in upcoming sprint. Before being estimated or worked on, all tickets must have tasks and acceptance criteria defined. |
|**Ready**|	Ready tickets are tickets that come from the backlog. Once a Backlog ticket is estimated, it gets moved into the Ready column. These tickets are ready to go (well defined, estimated, approved by the team), but not in any current sprint.|
|**Current Sprint**	|These tickets are taken from the Ready column and are queued to be completed in the current sprint. This is the "to do" column for the current sprint.|
|**In Progress**|	These tickets represent the work that is going on currently. Active work (development, documentation, etc) should be reflected in a ticket in this column. This is one of the few columns that every ticket should be in at one point. A ticket's assignee should be putting notes and updates on currently worked on tickets.|
|**Blocked**|	Tickets in the blocked column can not be worked on for some reason. That reason should be documented on the ticket, and if a ticket exists that fixes that blocker, that ticket should be linked.|
|**Validate**|	This column represents tickets that no longer being actively worked on, but are going through some review process. This review process can be, but not limited to, meetings or code reviews.|
|**Closed**|	These tickets are complete and are confirmed to be completed.|

#### Program Increment Planning
Since our work is closely related, we may attend PI planning with the My HealtheVet National Portal teams doing work for OCC.  These are 3.5 day sessions typically held in March, June, September, and December.  The organizer for that activity will send out invitations several weeks prior.  As our team members shift, the PO or PM should let the organizer know to add/remove people.

#### Roadmap

#### Sprint Planning

- Wednesday before the start of each sprint @ 2PM ET
- 2 hours 

#### Backlog Refinement
Assess and update workload for remainder of sprint

##### Issue Estimates

| Point | Task Size | Complexity | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Easy  | Very Simple | Work is known, can be executed quickly |
| 2 | Small | Simple | Work is known, and can be completed with minimal hours |
| 3 | Medium | Average | Work is known, and can be completed in a couple days |
| 5 | Large  | Complex | Work is known and can be completed in half a sprint | 
| 8 | XLarge | Very Complex | Work is complex and/or there might be unknown factors that need to be discussed prior to planning. Once further information is known, break down into smaller tickets that can be completed in a sprint with certantity. |
| 13 | XXLarge |  | Needs discovery before it can be planned for a sprint. If a story is estimated as 13, it should be broken down into smaller tickets that can be completed in the sprint. |

Most of the team's tickets are larger initiatives that include tasks from multiple disciplines (engineering, design, research, QA). When estimating these tickets, typically team members estimate only for their discipline's work. To get the estimate for the entire ticket, add the discipline estimates and assign it the nearest fibonacci value. 

#### Retrospective
Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, what can be improved, what questions people have, and any action/improvement items

- Every other Thursday @ 1:05 PM ET

#### Sprint Demo
Review and demonstrate accomplishments and work completed. 

- Every other Wednesday @ 1:05 PM ET
