# KPI Pre-Workshop Planning

### Product Line
- Facilities

### North Star
- Created and documented a repeatable, scalable VAMC site upgrade process in order for VHA to be able to upgrade 134 legacy VAMC system websites over a 12-month period


### Product
- VA Medical Center - Website Modernization (Upgrade)._


### High Level Objectives
- By the end of this six-month period, we will have 9 additional VAMC websites ready for production on VA.gov.


- All new site content is drafted and published in Drupal Prod (prod.cms.va.gov)
- All legacy content, files, links, etc. have been accounted for on the new sites
- All new sites have been fully QA'd by the team and ready to hand off to the business for UAT
- All processes and procedures are documented in guides, run books, and content creation sheets to be repeatable and scalable

### Pain Points
_VAMC websites are confusing to navigate, have outdated or missing information, and don’t match their VA health care journey.

- To Much information and links
- Language on pages are to long
- Content is to wordy, outdated, and needs to be in plain language
- Web site migration has to be completed in a compressed and scalable fashion

### Desired Outcomes
- Build new VA medical center (VAMC) websites for each location that better meets the needs of Veterans and their families and caregivers.

- Mobile-first design with one-tap access to phone, email, and maps
- Integration of VA’s digital health tools, like online scheduling, prescription refill, and access to medical records[Fill out here]
- Consolidate and compress content from legacy sites to new compressed web design
- Account for all links and document ones that will be moved, changed, or dropped.

### Hypotheses
- VAMC-Upgrade team will create a clear cross matrix and road map to point out the economies of scale where possible, efficiencies in creation of pages, and step-by-step guides for content migration that can be utilized accross the global organization.
