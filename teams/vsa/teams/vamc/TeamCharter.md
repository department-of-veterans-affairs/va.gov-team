# VAMC-Upgrade Team

## Guideposts
### VAMC Mission Statement
Enable Veterans,their family, and caregivers, through use of the VA's VISN Medical Center Websites, to quickly provide access to the tools and information needed in their VA health care journey.  Remove obsticals and promote a streamlined, easy to navigate, and easy to understand digital experience.  Escalate this normalized and standardized methodology accross all VISNs using economies of scale and advanced Agile practices. 

### VAMC Vision
Providing these upgraded and streamlined tools to the ALL VAMC system Office of Public Affairs and adminstrators, so that they can efficently support and continualy enable Veterans, their family, and caregivers in their VAMC journey. 

### VAMC North Star
Systems published to "pre-prod" per quarter. (Q2 Goal - 8 from VISN 4)

### OKRs 

#### Q1 2020
- Objective: "Push-button System creation"
  - Key Result: 100% of system components included in package
    - System components e.g. detail page, facility page, menu
  - Key Result: Reduce time to finalize and incorporate content for 1 system to less than 1 month
  
#### Q2 2020 -  
- Objective: "Push-button System creation"
  - Key Result: Reduce time to finalize and incorporate content for *n* systems to less than 1 month
- Objective: "Automated System & Facility Health Service Load"
  - Key Result: Reduce time to input System and Health Services into each System build per Sprint
- Objective: "Standardize Data Collection and presentation"
  - Key Result: Reduce time to have data validated and returned from PAO/stakeholder
  - Key Result: Data will transform into .csv for automation into Systems
  
#### Q3 2020 - Tentative 
- Objective: "Automate Staff Profile data load"
  - Key Result: Load entire database with all known Staf profiles to reduce time to update related nodes (Caregiver, Leadership).
- Objective: "Create and standardize Content creation road map" 
  - Key Resutl: 
 
#### KPIs
- page scaffolds created in a sprint
- time to receive data/complete validated kick-off package back from PAO
- pages loaded with data in a sprint 
- pages loaded with content in a sprint

#### Bets
- blank package for a system and let that run thru all req checks e.g. 508
- dropping content into components/fields automatically 
- dropping content into a content block (create block + drop content in for that block e.g. accordion for parking info)
- created components + content via a "business-focused" CSV  
- Stub out 2 future VISNs at a time with their scaffold
- Load as much data in playbooks and data gathering as possible to reduce validation time
- Hardening pages will reduce content changes from system to system


## What we work on
Optimization of content, language, and website structure to improve the website journey.  This includes reduction in page count, word count, and increased percentage of plain language throughout the site. While highlighting Veteran specified "Top Tasks", repetative activities, and web site priorities.

### Product Line Focus
_VA Medical Center Website Modernization starting with:_
_VISN 4 web systems consisting of eight remaining Medical Center System Websites and forty-eight facilities.

### Description of Current Work
_Update and Modernize VA.gov-[Medical Center] websites using human-centered design, agile development, and DevOps practices that emphasize continuous integration/continuous delivery to iterate on the best solutions for VA.gov Medical Center website users. Utilize the pilot project website 'www.va.gov/pittsburg-health-care/ as the template and base of continuing and improving our customer experience_

### Github Labels

### Points of Contact 
- Product Management: Stan Gardner / sgardnerPMP

### Workflow + Cadence
<b>Backlog Grooming:</b> Assess and update workload for each sprint and remainder of sprint, Wednesday of every sprint, 1-hour
<b>Stand-up:</b> People / Product check-ins Daily @ [TBD] 15 min 3 Question Format: What I did yesterday? What will I do today? Any impediments?<br>
<b>Sprint Planning:</b> Outline team and member focus, goals for sprint 1st Wednesday of every sprint 2 hours<br>
<b> Retro:</b> Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, areas for improvement, what to start doing 1st Tuesday of every sprint, 30 min <br>

### Issue Etiquette

_For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):_<br>
  - Estimate<br>
  - Title that explains task<br>
  - Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria<br>
  - Labels - vamc-upgrade (and cross functional team labels)<br>
  - User Story, Goal, Acceptance Criteria - please fill out the Goal and any known acceptance criteria. The PM will revise as necessary.<br>
  -	Epic assigned<br><br>
_All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new <b>RED LIGHT URGENT</b> work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint_

### Estimation
_Estimation is not based on how long something will take to complete, but is rather a combined rating encompassing risk, level of effort (LOE), and complexity.<br>
1 - Easy task, work is known, can be executed quickly<br>
2 - Mostly known, doable<br>
3 - Becoming complex<br>
5 - Very complex, may take a full sprint or longer<br>
8 - Needs to be broken down into smaller user stories_<br>

### And some logistics:
_Keep as much Slack conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication. GitHub is the single source of truth. Everybody of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning. Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to an issue or useful to document, copy them into GitHub. Our tickets/issues have an estimated level of effort, clear acceptance criteria, and an individual or team assignee before being put in a sprint. Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub._
