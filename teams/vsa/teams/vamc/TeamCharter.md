### VAMC North Star
Systems completed per quarter

### OKRs - Q1 2020
- Objective: Automate VISN creation
  - Key Result: 100% of system components included in package
    - System components e.g. detail page, facility page, menu
  - Key Result: Reduce time to finalize and incorporate content for a given system to less than 1 month
#### KPIs
- Number of site/system page scaffolds completed in a sprint
- Number of sites/systems completed in a sprint (with 508 + content)

#### Bets
- blank package for a system and let that run thru all req checks e.g. 508
- dropping content into components/fields automatically 
- dropping content into a content block (create block + drop content in for that block e.g. accordion for parking info)
- created components + content via a "business-focused" CSV  


## What we work on
Optimization of content, language, and website structure to improve the website journey.  This includes reduction in page count, word count, and increased percentage of plain language throughout the site. While highlighting Veteran specified "Top Tasks", repetative activities, and web site priorities.

### Workflow + Cadence
<b>Backlog Grooming:</b> Assess and update workload for each sprint and remainder of sprint, Wednesday of every sprint, 1-hour
<b>Stand-up:</b> People / Product check-ins Daily @ [TBD] 15 min 3 Question Format: What I did yesterday? What will I do today? Any impediments?<br>
<b>Sprint Planning:</b> Outline team and member focus, goals for sprint 1st Wednesday of every sprint 2 hours<br>
<b> Retro:</b> Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, areas for improvement, what to start doing 1st Tuesday of every sprint, 30 min <br>

### Issue Etiquette

_For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):_<br>
  - Estimate<br>
  - Title that explains task<br>
  - Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria<br>
  - Labels - vamc-upgrade (and cross functional team labels)<br>
  - User Story, Goal, Acceptance Criteria - please fill out the Goal and any known acceptance criteria. The PM will revise as necessary.<br>
  -	Epic assigned<br><br>
_All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new <b>RED LIGHT URGENT</b> work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint_

### Estimation
_Estimation is not based on how long something will take to complete, but is rather a combined rating encompassing risk, level of effort (LOE), and complexity.<br>
1 - Easy task, work is known, can be executed quickly<br>
2 - Mostly known, doable<br>
3 - Becoming complex<br>
5 - Very complex, may take a full sprint or longer<br>
8 - Needs to be broken down into smaller user stories_<br>

### And some logistics:
_Keep as much Slack conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication. GitHub is the single source of truth. Everybody of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning. Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to an issue or useful to document, copy them into GitHub. Our tickets/issues have an estimated level of effort, clear acceptance criteria, and an individual or team assignee before being put in a sprint. Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub._
