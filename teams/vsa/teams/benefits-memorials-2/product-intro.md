## Product Team Mission 
The Debt Resolution team is focused on making VA.gov the "go-to" resource for Veterans to review all of their real-time debt information easily and reliably. Our mission is to help Veterans understand why they have debt, what the status of their debt is, and what steps they need to take to resolve their debt.

#### General Notes about this project:

- The Denver Logistics Center (DLC) is a warehouse that distributes hearing aid batteries, hearing aid accessories, and prosthetic socks to qualifying Veterans
- An online ordering tool already existed, but only allowed Veterans to order batteries
- A significant amount of Veterans need to order accessories as well, so the online ordering tool had a low usage rate because they'd need to call or mail an order card to order the rest of their items anyway 
- The project was originally slated to include all of those items, but we quickly found out that prosthetic socks only account for ~1% of all orders
- As a result, we decided to focus on bringing hearing aid accessories into the online ordering experience to increase engagement 
- Veterans can order items once every 6 months, so it's entirely possible for items to be on different ordering cadences 
- We only display items that have been ordered within the past 2 years 
- We originally had hearing aid batteries + accessories items on separate pages with a gatekeeping question asking whether or not they needed to order those items, but post-usability we put all items on one page
- Due to the form system's constraints, we're unable to make item selection required; Veterans can theoretically submit an empty order but we show an alert if this happens
- After this tool launched our team pivoted to working on the Debt Portal and have since expanded to focus on the wider VA Debt experience


**FAQs about the Medical Device Reordering Tool** 
 
 - TBD
		    
#### Intended improvements:

- None at this time
- The DLC reached out for us to add prosthetic socks and CPAPs to the online ordering ecosystem, but that work currently isn't captured on the roadmap

 **Relevant Dates:** 
 - Product Launch Date: Late 2020

#### General Notes about this project:

* **This is the MVP product for what has now become the Combined Debt Portal**
* The Debt Portal is a product that responds to the Veteran Fair Debt Notice Act; it shows a subsection of the most common debts and their letters.
* The portal shows the status of a debt through the 'diary code' being sent to us (e.g. "awaiting payment," "your compromise offer was accepted," "on hold," etc.) and tells a Veteran what their next steps are.
* The stakeholder group for this is VBA's Debt Management Center (Jill is our main stakeholder) 
* The types of debts shown in the product currently are the ones whose PDFs that are available through VBMS, but we are able to pull data for those other debts.
* Research during this project uncovered that Veterans expected to find medical copays in the same place as debts, which led to the Combined Debt Portal
* Future state: moving to umbrella project that contains Benefit Debt + Medical Copays  


### **FAQs: about the VBA Debt Portal** 
- ***Q: ~~Debt Letters are sent from VBMS to the Debt Portal. What type of Letters are Veterans able to view and download?~~***
   - A: ~~Examples of [the letters can be found here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/debt-letters-mvp/letter-samples). Additionally, here is a breakdown of the letters that we are sharing:~~  
     - ~~100 - Inactive debtor initial notification~~  
     - ~~101 - Active debtor debt notification~~  
     - ~~117 - Inactive debtor second notification~~  
     - ~~123 - Inactive debtor final notification~~  
     - ~~130 - debt increase letter~~

- ***Q: What types of debts can a Veteran see on the Debt Portal?***
     - A: Veterans can access the following debt types within the portal:
        - Compensation and Pension
        - Ch 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill)
        - CH 34
        - CH 35
 
- ***Q: What are diary codes and how were they grouped for the various debt messages?***
     - A: The Debt Management Center (DMC) has a database containing over 200 diary codes that a debt can sit in. Some of these diary codes might include receiving a Financial Status Report, a second notification letter being sent, or a waiver being reviewed. The diary codes were grouped together with the help of our DMC stakeholders through multiple workshop sessions. 

- ***Q: Is there a list/spreadsheet of diary codes for VBA Debt***
     - A: Both the spreadsheet of original diary codes and our grouped version can be found in the VSA Team Sharepoint: 
        - [Original diary code spreadsheet](https://salientcrgt.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/VSATeam/Shared%20Documents/Design%20%26%20Research/Benefits%20%26%20Memorials%202/Debt%20Letters%20Master%20Codes%20and%20Transactions%20Catalog.xlsx?d=w50365d7002b248828873928f7b6a6c7f&csf=1&web=1&e=8xDirj) 
        - [Grouped diary codes spreadsheet](https://salientcrgt.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/VSATeam/Shared%20Documents/Design%20%26%20Research/Benefits%20%26%20Memorials%202/Debt%20Letters%20MVP/Iteration%203/Debt%20Portal%20Statuses%20V2.0.xlsx?d=web6d9eb5b68e4a89b8efb3b8ecbefc31&csf=1&web=1&e=T6iP8w)
  
- ***Q: What are Post 9/11 GI bills? What are the three parts they include? ***
   - A: The Post-9/11 GI Bill (CH 33) is an education benefit type for Veterans who've served on active duty after Septmeber 10, 2001. [You can read more about this benefit type here](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/). If a Veteran incurs a Post-9/11 GI Bill debt, it's split into **three separate debts** for:
      - Housing
      - Tuition and fees
      - Books and supplies  
  
- ***Q: What are comp and pen debts***
   - A: Veterans who have a service-related injury or illness may be entitled to disability compensation. Compensation and Pension debts are the result of an overpayment in their monthly benefit received for their disability compensation.
		    
#### Intended Improvements/Next Steps:

* Debt history table to replace 'debt letter history' table
* Incorporate payment data / Update 'Next step' cards with new design
* Incorporate all benefit debt types
* Allow for simpler payment pathway by connecting to pay.va.gov
* (Long-term goal) combine portal with medical copayments portal so all money owed is visible
* (Long-term goal) provide sitewide notifications to alert authenticated Veterans of a debt

 - Product Launch Date: November 2021

#### General Notes about this project:

- This is a follow-on feature based on the Debt Portal work 
- Veterans can currently use this form to request a payment plan, waiver, or compromise offer for their VBA debts 
- The form's purpose is to capture a monthly snapshot of the Veteran's financial situation
- Through research we learned that Veterans often incorrectly fill out the paper form
   * They duplicate their expenses in multiple sections 
   * They miscalculate section totals which impact the total of leftover income that DMC reviews to assess whether or not to approve a request
-  It's in the Veteran's best interest to provide all their expenses so the DMC has an accurate view of their finances; we sought to support that through the new list loop component 
   * Veterans struggled to use the component during usability testing; they would type letters to see what appeared in the dropdown, didn't realize the input field was freeform, and would continue to the next page without saving 
- Veterans are anxious about questions in the form related to household assets (homes, cars, additional assets) 
- Veterans are able to download a PDF copy of the form they just completed 

#### **FAQs: about Financial Status Report** 

***Q: Where can I see the hardcopy Form 5655?***
  A: [VA Form 5655](https://www.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/va5655.pdf) which is accessible on the [portal here](https://staging.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-5655/). 
  

- ***Q: Why do the list loops need to be redone? Why didn't they test well? ***
   - A: The list loops were a component created for the Financial Status Report's MVP in an attempt to help Veterans quickly add multiple items of a similar category. For example, adding 10 utilities. However, usability testing found that the component wasn't intuitive. [You can read more about our findings here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/Debt%20Resolution/Financial-Status-Report/research/mar-2021/readout.md#are-veterans-able-to-easily-use-the-new-list-loop-component).   
		    

#### Intended Improvements/Next Steps:

* Combined FSR (bringing in copay debts)
* Improved wizard (one question per page)
* List loop improvements
* Resubmit form / prefill functionality
* Credit card improvement to installment contracts and other debts section
* (Long-term goal) exploring ways to reduce forcing Veterans within certain financial thresholds from filling out the entire form (i.e. unemployed for the past 2 years, cars under a certain value, etc.)

 **Relevant Dates:** 
 - Product Launch Date: January 2022

#### Notes about this project:

* Shows active balances for facilities and allows for downloading statements from the past six months.
* NOT real-time; our balances only update when new statements are generated monthly
* Built out separately for a few reasons, primarily IA/Auth Exp concerns, but would ideally be combined so that all debt is found together.
* Infrastructure / data support is much weaker for copays than benefit debts

#### **FAQs about Medical Copays** 

- ***Q: What are EHRM/ Cerner Statements***
  A: Here is the answer
		    

#### Intended Improvements/Next Steps:
- Charges / payments table (trimmed from MVP)
- Showing facilities with $0 balances and their respective bills from the past 6 months
- Extending data past 6 months
- Improving to (more) real-time data (possibly pulled from CDW
- Payment agreement data / FSR status (also possibly accessible from CDW)
- Status (currently unsupported with their systems)
- (Long-term goal) combine with debt portal so all money owed is visible
