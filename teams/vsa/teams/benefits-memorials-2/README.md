### **Team Norms**

  * Be respectful, both online and off
  * Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
  * Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
  * We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work

**And some logistics:**
Slack conversation: va-bam-2
Use GitHub for documenting, tracking, and capacity planning.
Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to an issue or useful to document, copy them into GitHub.
Our tickets/issues have an estimated level of effort, clear acceptance criteria, and an individual or team assignee before being put in a sprint.
Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
