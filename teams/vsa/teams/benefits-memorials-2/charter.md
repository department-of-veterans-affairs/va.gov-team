## Team Workflow
_[Additional Information](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/benefits-memorials-2/Workflow.md)_
 
 **Norms**
  * Be respectful, both online and off
  * Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
  * Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
  * We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
  * Assume best intentions - especially when in a remote setting
  * Trust one another and ask questions freely and frequently
  * Celebrate the wins - even the small ones
  * Let’s have fun and do great work!

**Communication Best Practices** 
  - Slack is the best communication method - Please use DSVA slack channel [**#benefits-debt-resolution**] as much as possible
  - Slack channels allow us to do our work in the open so that others can learn from the questions asked and the answers provided. Please do the same.
  - VFS teams should use public Slack channels as their first method of communication.
  - Keep as much Slack conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.
  - Don't wait to organize a meeting to ask a question; this will slow our team down. 
  - Email is the least effective communication method
  - Email communications are not easily searchable or archivable. Use this as a last resort for communication.

**Decision Etiquette**

Decisions are part of our daily routine, the below questions can help kickstart the decision making and creative thinking process.
1. Is it my decision to make?
2. Do I have all the information to make the decision?
3. Do I have to make the decision now?

## GitHub Guidelines

- GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to an issue or useful to document, copy them into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Our tickets/issues have an estimated level of effort, clear acceptance criteria, and an individual or team assignee before being put in a sprint.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
-  All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.
- If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

## Issue Estimation
_In an effort to standardize  team estimates the below can act as a reference guide during team planning sessions and Github Issue tracking.  The below chart will be updated as we review the sprint pipeline reflected burndown and velocity estimations of previous sprint performance._  

| Scale  | Days/Weeks (Estimated)  | Story/Feature/Capability/Epic  | Description                                                            |
|--------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Partial Day             | Quick Fix / Very Small Story   | Easy/Trivial task, work is known, can be executed quickly,  minor fixes                                              |
| 2      | 1-3 Days                  | Small Story                    | Easy task, work is mostly known, doable, can be executed quickly                      |                                                |
| 3      | 3-5 days/< a Week                 | Mid-Sized Story                | Becoming complex                                                       |
| 5      | 1.5 Weeks               | Large Story                    | complex task that will take a few days or longer                       |
| 8     | Full Sprint or longer      | Very Large Story / Feature     | Very complex / not all facets known / may take a full sprint / needs to be broken down into smaller user stories  |
                                                    
*NOTE*:  Story points are unitless scales of measurement which are sized in relation to other tasks. This idea of relative sizing is the fundamental driver in Agile estimation and should help keep work effort streamlined and provide scalability forward.
