### **Workflow + Cadence**

**Stand-up**
People / Product check-ins
Daily @ TBD EST
15 min
3 Question Format: What I did yesterday? What will I do today? Any impediments?

**Sprint Planning**
Outline team and member focus, goals for sprint
1st Wednesday of every sprint
2 hours

**Retro**
Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, areas for improvement, what to start doing
1st Tuesday of every sprint, 30 min

**Grooming** 
Assess and update workload for remainder of sprint
2nd Wednesday of every sprint, 1-hour

### **Issue Etiquette**
For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):
  * Estimate
  * Title that explains task
  * Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
  * Labels - vsa-benefits (and cross functional team labels)
  * User Story, Goal, Acceptance Criteria - please fill out the Goal and any known acceptance criteria. The PM will revise as necessary.
  * Epic assigned
  
All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

### **Estimation**
Estimation is not based on how long something will take to complete, but is rather a combined rating encompassing risk, level of effort (LOE), and complexity.

1 - Easy task, work is known, can be executed quickly  
2 - Mostly known, doable   
3 - Becoming complex  
5 - Very complex, may take a full sprint or longer  
8 - Needs to be broken down into smaller user stories  

### **Team Norms**

  * Be respectful, both online and off
  * Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
  * Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
  * We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
  * Let’s have fun and do great work!

**And some logistics:**

Keep as much Slack conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.
GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.
Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to an issue or useful to document, copy them into GitHub.
Our tickets/issues have an estimated level of effort, clear acceptance criteria, and an individual or team assignee before being put in a sprint.
Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
