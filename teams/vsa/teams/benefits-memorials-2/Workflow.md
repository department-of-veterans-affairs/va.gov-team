* What needs to get done to move our product forward? What’s the highest priority? (10 minutes)
* What’s something that could come down the pipeline that would disrupt everything? (5 minutes)

**Github**
⚡️ I would like to have Github open during the meeting to have new bugs, issues and technical debt to help facilitate the meeting.

**Problem Board**
1. Define a business problem you are trying to solve or a goal that you are trying to reach.
