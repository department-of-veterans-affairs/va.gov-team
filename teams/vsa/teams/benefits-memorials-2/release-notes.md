**2022**
|November 29, 2022|**My VA Copay Information:** In conjunction with the MyVA team, we launched updates to how we display payment and debt information on the My VA dashboard. This information had been on the dashboard since May 2022; we made some updates based on user feedback and updated VA.gov functionality. Improvements include adding copay information to MyVA, which did not previously exist. We separated payment information and debt/copy information into two separate sections. Previously, these existed as one section, but this caused some usability issues, as debt information was de-emphasized in favor of payment information, and sometimes people though their payment information was money owed to VA, not money VA had paid to them. |
|July 19, 2022|**Combined Debt Portal:** This is the first step in simplifying the process for Veterans claiming medical debt forgiveness. As a result, Veterans are now able to review their benefit debts and medical copays via one experience on http://va.gov/manage-va-debt. |
|April 20, 2022|**My VA Overpayment Debt Information:** In partnership with the My VA Authenticated Experience team, the Financial Management team helped in launching a new dashboard which shows most recent payment information, debt information, and a link to update people's direct deposit information. This update stemmed from Veteran feedback (it was one of the most asked-for and searched-for information from this page). |
|March 2, 2022|**Presidential Initiative - Reducing Financial Hardship:** President Biden announced on March 2, 2022 that VA is: Simplifying the process for claiming medical debt forgiveness. VA will streamline the request process and set a simple income threshold for receiving medical debt relief. The request process will include an online option for veterans and reduce the effort required by veterans to access relief. These changes will go into effect in the next 90 to 120 days. This change comes on top of the approximately $1 billion in medical debt the VA has already forgiven for veterans under the American Rescue Plan, which eliminated all out-of-pocket medical cost for veterans and provided much needed financial relief to veterans experiencing economic hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also comes on top of a final rule VA issued in February 2022, under which it will virtually cease reporting unfavorable debt, including medical debt, to consumer reporting agencies. |
**2021**
|October 4, 2021|**Retirement of Debtman Site:** Add in info. See press release **[here](https://news.va.gov/press-room/press-statement-va-resumes-overpayment-notifications-medical-copayment-collections-while-continuing-to-offer-veterans-expansive-debt-relief-options/)**|
|January 12, 2021|**Launch of Debt Portal:** Veterans now have unprecedented access to information about debts they may have incurred with VA, along with the information and tools they need to resolve these debts. The Debt Portal provides information on the origin of debts, their current status, to include things like the debt amount and due date, and their options for resolving the debt. This new level of transparency and clarity, along with the fact that for the first time ever, Veterans will be able to access this information digitally, should result in better financial outcomes for Veterans who havve incurred debts with VA.
