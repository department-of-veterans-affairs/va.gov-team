## Overall Usage

Slack is the main form of communication on VSA. as such, everyone is expected to:

* [Download the desktop slack app](https://slack.com/downloads/)
* Check the app multiple times a day
* Respond to DMs and notifications promptly
* Contribute to team discussions

All of slack is subject to the governments’ FOIA (freedom of information act), including DMs, so be smart and polite in all interactions with folks.

### General Usage Tips

Slack provides general tips to help you be more effective and productive on Slack, [which can be found here](https://slack.com/help/categories/360000049063-Tips-Tricks-More).

We recommend usage of the following features:

* ** Stars.** You can “star” a message that you need to come back to. In order to see all starred messages, click on the star icon in the top right corner of Slack
* **Previous/Next arrows** - These arrows are in the top left corner to the right of “jump to.” If Did you read something, then go to another channel, and forget where you read the first original message? You can use the little “back” arrow to go back to where you were. ![img](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/qFkrWxt0NoQtyq0X_CLdIo4a0PgYA2r0EpW_RZ3M_UjMGDeI_vhPBlkV1V-sH1ZmzP576Ym76zZJ49117d-J6BVvHTgGDanhKS6jSZJa-wlNdpVGHJtnH03SQ5qpfNRErSgevMpm)

#### Slack Apps

Slack applications allow content created in other tools to make their way into Slack for greater visibility. Some helpful Slack apps include:

* Google Drive - updates on action items, permission requests
* Google Calendar - event notifications, automatic status updates
* Clockwise - event notifications, automatic status updates

### Contractor Slack channels versus DEPO slack channels

There are two slack instances that you will be invited to (Message Julie Ramirez if you don’t have access to both). 

**The GCIO/Ad Hoc contractor Slack:** There are shared slack channels between the two companies where we chat about our work. This channel is meant mostly for internal conversations that we don’t need to necessarily surface to others working on VA.gov.

**The DSVA Digital Services @ VA Slack:** This Slack instance includes our client (the VA) as well as any other contracting group that works on VA.gov. These channels are useful for any discussions about the product, since we work with the VA and others to build our applications.

## Guidance on Channel Usage

### Channels versus DMs

You should use public channels for discussion about your work whenever possible. If you are about to send a DM, first think if there’s a clear reason you really can’t send it in a public channel. The reasons for trying to keep communication in public channels are:

* **Visibility & documentation for individual contributors** - if you are asking a question about your work, and other team members have the same question, they can read it and later search for it
* **Visibility for leadership** - leadership often follows all the slack channels, and will look at specific team channels to see how things are going and if there are any blockers. 

We know some of you have concerns about posting questions in the team channels. We address some of these concerns in the FAQ section of this document. 

### Team Channels

All of you (except shared resources) have been assigned a team when you first join. Each team has their own team channel in the DSVA/DEPO slack.  Make sure you join your team channel as soon as you can. The team channels are outlined below:

* Authenticated Experience - #vsa-authd-exp

* Benefits & Memorials 1 - #vsa-benefits-memorial

* Benefits & Memorials 2 - #vsa-bam-2

* Caregiver - #vsa-caregiver

* eBenefits - #vsa-ebenefits

* Facility Locator - #vsa-facilities

* Medical Center Sites - #vsa-vamc-upgrade

* Public Websites - #vsa-public-websites

These team channels are where you will be spending the majority of your time. They are meant for communication with your team about the things you’re working on, sprint ceremonies, etc. 

### VSP Channel

VSP runs a channel called #vsf-platform-support. Use this channel to:

* Request PR reviews or design reviews
* Ask questions about processes (first ask practice leads, then ping the channel if they don’t have an answer) 
* Ask questions about environments (e.g. staging, dev)
* Any other questions about the platform as a whole

## Practice Specific Slack Guidance

### Design

You should join all the channels below. Guidance on how to use them is provided.

#### GCIO / Ad Hoc Channels

**#va-vsa-ux** - this is our “home base” for the team, where we all support each other. Use this channel for:

* Asking for feedback / thoughts on designs
* Asking if other members of the team have worked on anything similar
* Sharing resources—blogs, articles, etc.—that others may benefit from
* Shawna letting the team know about any new initiatives / processes / etc.
* Posting kudos about each other
* Posting fun things to lighten things up 

#### DSVA Channels
**#vsa-design** - this channel is for posting about our work that could benefit from larger visibility. Right now we use it for:
* Posting weekly Wednesday updates with links about what each team member is currently working on, and what’s upcoming
* Re-posting links from other DSVA channels that we want to make sure the design team sees.

**#design** - this channel has all designers across VA.gov. It’s nice to ask questions here if you can to help us start thinking about each other as one big design team. This channel is useful for:
* Asking questions about how components are used
* Asking for “past work” done across the site to help you in your process - e.g. something like “Has anyone else worked on a form that does x?”
* Asking process questions - e.g. “how have folks typically done x”

**Flow-specific channels** (e.g. #design-system, #vetsgov-accessibiilty) - these channels are pretty quiet, so may not be the best channel to use if you want to ask the design team a question or let them know about something. I’d mostly use the #design channel for any questions. 

### Product
#### GCIO / Ad Hoc Channels
**#va-vsa-product** - this is our “home base” for the team, where we all support each other. Use this channel for:
* Asking for feedback / thoughts on product questions
* Asking if other members of the team have worked on similar problems
* Sharing lessons learned from product bets and initiatives
* Sharing resources—blogs, articles, etc.—that others may benefit from
* Mickin letting the team know about any new initiatives / processes / etc.
* Posting kudos about each other
* Posting fun things to lighten things up

#### DSVA Channels
**#vsa-product** - this channel is for posting about our work that could benefit from larger visibility. Right now we use it for:
* Coordinating Scrum ceremonies e.g. Sprint Demo, Team of Teams
* Re-posting links from other DSVA channels that we want to make sure the product team sees

### Engineering

#### GCIO / Ad Hoc Channels

**#channel** - This channel

* A

#### DSVA Channels

**#va-vsa-engineering** - this is our “home base” for the team, where we all support each other. Use this channel for:

* Asking if other members of the team have worked on anything similar
* Sharing resources—blogs, articles, etc.—that others may benefit from
* Lou letting the team know about any new initiatives / processes / etc.
* Posting kudos about each other
* Posting fun things to lighten things up 

**#vsa-public-websites** - Most of our content folks are assigned to this team, so many content discussions happen here.  Even if you are assigned to a different team we'd recommend joining this channel and reading discussions there. 

**#cms-general** - use this channel if you have specific drupal-related questions

**#content** -  this channel has all content folks across VA.gov. It’s nice to ask questions here if you can to help us start thinking about each other as one big content team. This channel is useful for:

* Asking questions about how components are used across hte whole site
* Asking for “past work” done across the site to help you in your process - e.g. something like “Has anyone else worked on a page like this?”
* Asking process questions - e.g. “how have folks typically done x”



## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if I’m concerned about posting things to channels instead of DMs?

Below are some common concerns that have come up, and leadership’s answers to them:

**If I post things to channels, things will get “lost” and I won’t get an answer as quickly as if I DM someone.** 

To address this issue, make sure you are notifying people when appropriate, and using threading. For example, if you have an engineering question for Matt, post in your team channel “Hey @matt, [insert eng question here]” Matt can then reply to your post in a thread, so it doesn’t clutter up the team channel. 

**My team channel has a lot of unknown folks in it, as well as the client, I don’t want to “sound stupid” or “publically drag” anyone in front of all these people I may not know**

VA and VA.gov in general has a culture of asking lots of questions in the open. Not asking questions, and having a team channel that’s just crickets actually worries leadership more than seeing a lot of questions in the channel, some of which might not be the most sophisticated.

Of course, there is a line here. If you have specific questions about how to do your job, it is more appropriate to reach out to your practice lead. But if you have a question about the product or the work, please chat in your team channel for the reasons mentioned earlier. 

**When threads in a channel get really long, it’s hard to see everything in the right hand panel**

There is a “threads” channel at the very top of Slack, right under the “All unreads” box. If you click there, you can see all the threads *you’ve participated in*, in a full screen view.
