# Headings Project
## Problems to Solve
* We have one set of headings that was initially build for content pages. These headings are often amended with utility classes for pages that are more that solely content. Ideally, we would have heading stacks that worked for the contexts we have, and use limited utility classes.
* Our headings are not "linked back" to the design system website, so what's showing on that site does not necessarily reflect what's currently on the site
* There are certain design system elements that are not very accessible and sometimes break up the hierarchy of headings (e.g. the anchor link section, notifications).
