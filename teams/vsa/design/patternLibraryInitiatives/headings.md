# Headings Project
## Problems to Solve
* We have one set of headings that was initially build for content pages. These headings are often amended with utility classes for pages that are more that solely content. Ideally, we would have heading stacks that worked for the contexts we have, and use limited utility classes.
* Our headings are not "linked back" to the design system website, so what's showing on that site does not necessarily reflect what's currently on the site
* There are certain design system elements that are not very accessible and sometimes break up the hierarchy of headings (e.g. the anchor link section, notifications).

## Content Header Stack
### Current
#### Issues with current
* Design system typography page displays `h1` and `h5` in Bitter font, with all other heading sizes using Source Sans Pro.  Sketch file has `h1-h6` available in Bitter, and a Source Sans Pro variation for `h4-h6`.
* Many examples of pages across va.gov that are skip `h2` headings (I think due to use of blue promo box), or use an `h3` before an h2.
* Blue callout boxes and notification headers are inserting headings out of order from the rest of the content on the page. 
* Utility classes are being used on a one-off manner 
* Sketch library file has two sizes `h1` headings but doesn't differentiate between mobile + desktop, so it seems to have 2 competing options
* va.gov has different size headings for mobile + desktop but sizes are not specified in design system, nor included Sketch file (e.g. Sketch file has only one size for `h2`)
### Proposed
* Decide on heading stacks that work across pages, with utility classes used rarely and in a consistent, agreed-upon manner
* Determine an accessible solution for managing headings in promo + call out boxes
* Consider heading stacks for different page types (e.g. content, tool, etc); if this is not appropriate, optimize heading stack to work across all page types
