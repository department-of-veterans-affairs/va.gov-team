## VSA UXPin Accounts

There are currently 9 paid UXPin licenses, for a maximum of 10 UXPin accounts under our current plan. Each bolded individual below holds a license.

## Why we're using UXPin
- UXPin allows us to share detailed specs with our engineers and collaborators more easily, without extra licenses
- UXPin allows for quicker content copy/pasting
- UXPin has interactive features like form components that are useful when creating form prototypes for testing

**Note: Sketch is still our primary design tool for VSA members**; Sketch design files should be made available for our DEPO partners and future team members

## Using UXPin

### Primary workflow (for simpler prototypes)
- Install the Sketch to [UXPin plugin](https://www.uxpin.com/docs/getting-started/importing-from-sketch/#exporting-from-sketch)
- Sign in with your assigned shared account 
- Complete designs in Sketch and keep your .sketch files synced in Google Drive with Stream
- Use the plugin to sync up your design files for sharing with your team and stakeholders
- When you’re ready to test, add interactions and cover or replace flattened layers with UXPin DS components as needed (I recommend having one UXPin prototype for sharing specs and another for prototyping)

#### Notes about UXPin syncing with the plugin:
 - The UXPin plugin and import very slowly for large files!  
 - With plugin imports, your layers will be flattened into images, so you will not be able to change text or colors in the UXPin interface. While UXPin flattens all layers individually into images, it still maintains features like styles, css, and content in the Preview’s Spec mode for easy handoff.
 - Interactions will generally be preserved when you sync a new change up from Sketch, as long as layer names do not change. However, any deleted layer will reappear and any UXPin-native additions will remain.
 - Syncing your Sketch files with the plugin will not boot your account partner(s), but logging into the UXPin web interface will.

### Complex prototype workflow:
If you will be needing to do a lot of fast changes to the prototype itself, you can also import your Sketch file to be completely updatable in UXPin. 
- Complete designs in Sketch and keep your .sketch files synced in Google Drive with Stream
- Some symbols will not import correctly into UXPin, so copy over all necessary artboards into a new .sketch file and break all of your symbols at once using a plugin like [Detach All Symbols.](https://github.com/Pausansol/Detach-all-symbols)
- Import your Sketch file directly into the UXPin web interface
- Use the UXPin design system to replace flat interactive components in your Sketch file

## Notes about collaborating
- Logging onto the web app at the same time will log your partner out, be mindful and coordinate when possible!
- If you and your partner need access to the web app at the same time, ask to use Shawna's credentials
- Use the [UXPin plugin](https://www.uxpin.com/docs/getting-started/importing-from-sketch/) to sync up your designs, similar to the Invision workflow. **Note:** logging into and using the plug in should not affect your partner!
- If you're getting too many emails about other projects, you can update your email preferences in UXPin to just cover your and your partner's project(s)
- If your email is being used for the account, set up mail forwarding from hello@uxpin.com to your partner so that they get comment emails

## UXPin design system
Many design system components are currently available in UXPin's design system feature, including form components. Use these as needed to turn your Sketch imports into testable prototypes!

### Requesting Design System fixes / updates
Tag @becca in the #uxpin-shared slack channel and detail what problems you’re facing and what you need!

## Technical troubleshooting
UXPin is a little more advanced than InVision and we may run into problems during testing. 

### IE problems 
UXPin has the most problems with IE, so we will do the following to prevent unsuccessful research sessions:
- If a participant defaults to IE, ask if they have Chrome or Firefox and direct them to that.
- If a participant does not have an alternate browser, direct them to install Chrome or Firefox.
- If a participant does not want to install an alternative browser, allow for the participant to take over your screen to use the prototype

### Reporting technical issues
Post technical issues encountered in the Slack channel so that we can add troubleshooting for each case we find.
