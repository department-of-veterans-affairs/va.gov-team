## <a id="process"></a>VA.gov Base Process
There is a required basic process to follow for planning and executing design research on VA.gov applications under the Veteran-facing Services Applications (VSA) contract. The Digital Experience and Product Office (DEPO, formerly DSVA) updated process document can be found  [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/research-process.md). Please read that process doc first and then read this document for more tips/details.

## <a id="setup"></a>Setup
Create a new folder or folder structure in github under the product and/or application being researched, e.g. “UrgentCare/Research/June-2019-Usability-Test/.” This is where the research plan, conversation guide, notes, and final results should be stored. Read [this naming guide for further details](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/orientation/repo-guidelines.md)

Create a [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/research-plan-template.md) and [Conversation Guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md) and save them in that folder as Markdown files.

Note: after finalizing the conversation guide, consider creating and including in this folder a “note-taking template” in Github to help your note-takers.

Some thoughts about whether or not to include instructions to "think aloud" at the beginning of your conversation guide:
* This can be a helpful instruction in some cases, not as helpful in others.
* A live stream of consciousness style can be great for evaluating content for comprehension, or identifying potential confusing areas, but it's not a one-size-fits-all, belongs in every study kind of instruction.
* If you're evaluating task time, asking someone to think aloud can skew your results.
* If you want to really see what someone would do alone, by asking them to talk aloud, you're changing their behavior. In cases like this, you can better understand what you're looking for by asking specific questions at key moments during the testing.

## <a id="vsp-collaboration-cycle"></a>VSP Collaboration Cycle
* Before running a usability study, request a [Usability Testing Prep collaboration session with VSP](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/vsp-collaboration-cycle/vsp-collaboration-cycle.md#usability-testing-prep)
* VSP should schedule the meeting within 2-3 days
* Once the meeting has happened, take a look at the feedback. If the research plan and guide are good to go, you can send to Lauren that same day, and use the week things are being scheduled to make any requested changes to the prototype

## <a id="recruiting"></a>Recruiting
**Note: The language of our contract stipulates that you do not recruit veterans “on the side” to do informal research on your own. You must use DEPO’s services for all research recruiting. Please contact Lauren Alexanderson if you would like to talk to veterans in support of your work on VSA, and be sure to have her (or your DEPO contact) review and approve your plan.**

VA has an agreement with a recruiting organization that will manage all recruiting operations for you, including:  
* creating a screener to get the right participants, including Veterans, caregivers, service members, and dependents  
* scheduling in-person (only location: Fredericksburg, VA) or remote sessions
* sending reminders to research subjects, and dealing with no-shows

Information about using our recruiter, Pergean to recruit participants for your moderated usability and other research studies  [can be found here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md).

When writing your research plan, and filling out the "Recruiting" portion, seperate your asks into two sections, "must have" and "good to have".  The "must have" section should tell recruiters what you absolutely moust have in order to run the sessions. If you state these as questions to ask veterans in a screener and the answers they need to have, that will help Perigeon. Make sure also to put our [inclusive recommendations for recruiting asks](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/resources/inclusive-research-recommendations.md#inclusive-research-recommendations) in the "good to have" section.  

In order to recruit,
* Before recruiting, send your plan and Guide to Shawna to look over, either via slack or tagging her on a ticket. She will look over your plan and guide the same day you send it when possible.
* When you’re ready to recruit using Perigean, contact Lauren Alexanderson via e-mail or Slack **at least 1 week before you want to start sessions.** Inform her that you intend to do research and include a link to the [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/research-plan-template.md) and [Conversation Guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md). The Conversation Guide must be completed and reviewed prior to recruiting. 
* Once Lauren has approved your plan, please add the line “Reviewed and approved by Lauren Alexanderson on mm/dd/yyyy” on the bottom of the plan in Github.
* Because of the nature of working Veterans, it is common that they will not show up for scheduled sessions. Try to schedule between 1.5 and 2 times more sessions than you need so that you can complete sufficient sessions within your desired schedule. Also, consider early morning or evening sessions for fewer no-shows, as Veterans often have full-time jobs.
* If you'd like buffer time in between user sessions, make sure to state that in your research plan.
* Make sure to list your whole team and any interested stakeholders in the list of folks you want Perigeon to invite to the user sessions in your research plan. 
* If you are recruiting stakeholders or VA employees that are working on the other side of the forms, you do not go through Perigeon to recruit. It’s completely acceptable to casually talk to VA employees about your work as long as they aren’t being paid as research subjects.  
* As soon as you receive your participant roster from Perigean, double check it against your criteria. If they've missed anything important, reach out via the Slack group Lauren starts for your study so they can recruit additional participants.
* At the end of each day of research, schedule a “debrief” session where you invite all the observers to share the key takeaways from the sessions. Keep track of these key takeaways.  You need to schedule these sessions, Perigeon will not do that.

## <a id="pilot-sessions"></a> Pilot / Test Session
Run a pilot/test session before your study, including Perigean’s team, so you rehearse process of logging in, get any conversation guide kinks worked out, understand how to hand off mouse controls, and have a participant show their screen. VSP and/or Perigean can help schedule the pilot.

The recommendation is to recruit one of your developers as a pilot participant, to get them involved early in the process. If that doesn't work, feel free to ask VSP or one of your VSA design colleagues to act as a pilot participant.

[Guidelines have been written about being a pilot participant](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/design/research-pilot-participant-guidelines.md). These should be sent to the participant prior to the test session.

## <a id="taking-notes"></a> Taking Notes

We have to be careful with -- and if possible avoid using -- recordings because of Federal regulations regarding Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Assign a colleague, such as another designer or member of your team, to take verbatim notes during your research sessions. Perigean can also take verbatim notes for your research sessions, but you must request this at the beginning of the study. [Guidance on notetaking can be found here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/how-to-take-session-notes.md)

* Create a “session-notes” folder within your research study Github folder and storing each session as an .md document. Copy the conversation guide over to your .md file before each session so that you have a structured way to capture your notes
* You must scrub all notes of all PII before uploading them to Github.  PII is all content that could be used to identify the participant. Name, age, date of birth, location or specific VA facility (unless that is critical to the study), diagnoses, etc.
* An [example of verbatim notes can be found here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/discovery/research/discovery-aug-2019/notes/p7.md).

## <a id="recording"></a>Recording Sessions
* Get verbal consent from your participant within the recording itself. First ask if it’s ok, press record, then say “can you confirm on this recording that you are ok with this session being recorded?,” or whatever comes naturally to capturing a recording of what they’ve agreed to. 
* Make sure you press “record” yourself in the meeting software if you want your session recorded; they are not automatically recorded
   * In Zoom during a session, check under the Meetings tab and select Recorded
   * If you can’t find them, message your Perigean contact
* Download any recordings you need, but only keep for as long as necessary to complete synthesis. Then securely dispose of them. Older macs with HDDs had a securely empty trash function. Newer macs, you need to use the command line in the folder level. If you still have questions on how to securely delete things, feel free to drop the question in [#vfs-platform-support](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/vfs-platform-support)
* You can make clips of the recordings for sharing/presentations as long as those don’t contain PII. Those clips can be uploaded and included in Github. 
* **Do not upload any original session recordings to the cloud (Github, Dropbox, Google Docs, etc.) or any public or private server. The risk of accidentally disclosing PII outweighs any benefit provided by sharing original session recordings.**   

[Notes about what (not to) do with recordings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/synthesis/what-to-do-with-recordings.md) 

## <a id="running-sessions"></a>Running the Sessions
* Invite your teams to your sessions. Sometimes stakeholders can be invited to view sessions as well. [Read this document on how to invite and issue instructions to observers](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md)
* There is no need to share your video or ask participants to share video. Veterans are not instructed to share or expected to share video because of these reasons:
   * logistics - sometimes getting screensharing up and running is hard enough!
   * bandwidth - Veterans in low bandwidth locations may not be able to share video
   * comfort - we don't want to make any user feel uncomfortable
* Veteran specific moderating tips
   * You will hear hard stories from veterans. It’s OK to sympathize with the participant. Saying something like “I’m so sorry you had to go through that” is perfectly acceptable after hearing a story before moving on to your task or follow-up. It is almost never necessary or relevant to the goals of any VSA or VA.gov study to dig deeply into folks' trauma, however. The best attitude when in doubt is a middle ground where you show compassion but then move on the next task or question in a graceful way. E.g. "that sounds so hard/frustrating/difficult. [Switch back to script or intention of study] Could you tell me a bit more about your experience applying for that benefit?"
   * If someone asks you a question about the legal rules of how a program works, make sure to say "I'm not sure. But you can go to VA.gov and call the support line listed there."  Don't guess or say anything even if you might think you know the answer, because we don't want to get in legal difficulties.
   * Avoid saying "Thank you for your service" to Veterans. Some Veterans have a negative association with that phrase.
* General moderating tips:
   * Remember not to ask questions that are the same wording as what's on your designs. For example if you have a "learn more" dropdown don't ask "how would you learn more about this?"  It's pretty leading if you use the same terminology.  Instead something like "if you're confused, where would you go to get more information?"
   * Ask open-ended questions and avoid Yes/No prompts. 
   * Follow-up questions like with “Why?” and “Tell me more” if the user has given you a short statement or not provided enough information.
   * Avoid using morale/biased language like "good!" or "perfect!" when a user completes a task in the way you'd expect.
   * If someone asks you how something works or what happens when they click on something, respond with "how would you expect it to work?" rather than answering their question
* There is a channel in DSVA Slack called [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel).  Make sure to be in that channel when running your sessions and that your observers know about it.
   * Type “observer instructions” in the channel at the beginning of your day of sessions to give them tips
   * [Observer instructions can also be found here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md)
   * At the end of your session, take a look at the feedback backchannel and see if anyone brought up questions that you can address with your participant
* Before running sessions, it’s nice to provide a means for your team members and/or stakeholders to take notes. Share whatever method you will be using with your observers a day in advance of starting any sessions
   * You can do this in whatever way works for you, some ideas:
      * Have observers slack their notes in the feedback channel or your team channel and then compile in your spreadsheet
      * Create a Mural board and share out.  A [Mural template is available](https://app.mural.co/template/0e63994b-bce9-4b53-8e37-b5293a2b4dac/20381d25-a5d5-4457-9893-eeb2e9cb6ff4) to help observers take notes during your sessions.

## <a id="mobile-testing"></a>Mobile Testing
Many if not most veterans use mobile devices, so we encourage testing designs on mobile as well as desktop.

* Users can install Zoom on their phones or use the ["laptop hugging method"](https://slack-files.com/T03FECE8V-FQAC0QXJN-2904594b3e)
* Perigean can recruit mobile users for you. Be sure to meet with Perigean folks prior to sessions to make sure everyone understands the process and that Perigean knows how to coach users and help solve technical issues. 
* Be prepared to walk through the technical setup for mobile (or any) testing with a Veteran if they haven't figured out proper setup before the call begins. 

## <a id="synthesis"></a>Synthesis
The maximum given to you according to our contract to synthesize research is “6 business days.”  In general, a topline summuary should be produced as soon as possible when everything is fresh in folks' minds. If you think you need more time, talk to Shawna.  

The following process is recommended by the VSA Design Lead:
1. After each user session, if possible take quick notes about the participant. You can use [this spreadsheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ehTDLfv3ucCnj2I0frYo06qoAw6DCUIJU-XrcYuSdGc/edit#gid=0) to put in quick top of mind findings
2. At the end of each day of research, schedule a “debrief” session where you invite all the observers to share the key takeaways from the sessions. 
   * Use the spreadsheet linked above or whatever method works for you to gather observer takeaways. You can also see [an example spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HQErLCeXZVPD9qAausAezUiPiAwd9rAJSo3imxrcMns/edit#gid=0) 
   * If no one attends, simply use this time to fill out your spreadsheet on your own. 
2. Once all the research is done and all debriefs have been conducted, create a [“topline summary”](https://portigal.com/reading-ahead-topline-summary/) that captures key themes discussed coming out of the sessions and debriefs.
   * A template for your topline summary [can be found here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/design/topline-summary-template.md)
   * Examples: [Caregiver summary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JhGb4t8jelGwD-dnjJC533ia0YNuGfo9lKuQ5V6wBUA/edit) and [Facility Locator Search summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/research/user-research/FL-Search-march2020/topline-summary.md) 
3. The day after your last session, share the [topline summary](https://portigal.com/reading-ahead-topline-summary/) with necessary stakeholders that observed sessions and the team and ask if they feel anything was missing based on their observations. Also ask what topics they would like you to focus on when you conduct your detailed synthesis. 
Note: Caveat the topline summary by saying that detailed synthesis has not yet been done, so things may change in the final report.
4. Synthesize your research. 
   * To quickly synthesize, go through all the notes files and recordings files as needed and, using your topline as a base, create a final research results doc that fleshes out your findings in the following way:
      * Grab quotes to support your themes
      * Make sure you didn't miss any themes in your topline summary
   * If there is time and it's needed, you can do a modified [affinity mapping](https://generalassemb.ly/design/user-experience-design/affinity-mapping) activity.  
      *	Create a simple spreadsheet, and pull quotes and behaviors from each participant into the spreadsheet. 
      *	Code or tag each quote or behavior with relevant categories. 
      *	Move through each participant and revise codes as more insights coalesce. 
      *	Here’s an example: [sample of this from my Master’s thesis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ngx67-7vvVPeIZYgjX8pTP8w0aEED6I1lz_wJY6wR5Q/edit#gid=210944681) 
      *	You can also do more standard affinity-mapping style synthesis on a Miro or Mural board by putting quotes/behaviors on stickies and grouping them. 
      *	Here’s another commonly used method called [“the rainbow spreadsheet.”](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/04/rainbow-spreadsheet-collaborative-ux-research-tool/) 
5. Create your final research results. This should be a Github page (markdown file). This should be done within 6 business days after your last session. 
   * You also may want to create a presentation deck if you are going to show your results to stakeholders or at a demo.
   * Templates have been created for VSA for both the [github file](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/design/research-findings-template.md) and the [presentation deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IuycCke--2jL16sMNxtIYvnFku2JmQUzB_15V-9hdqU/edit#slide=id.p1). 
   * Preferred format is to have your results and/or presentation list the “Top 10 findings” from the study, then dig into those findings in the next slides/sections. This allows stakeholders to quickly grasp the findings without reading the whole deck/page.   
      * These top findings should stand on their own. So if a stakeholder *only* reads your list of top findings, and no details, they should think "oh, this research was useful!" Not "Oh these are general statements that I could have just guessed myself."
   * Examples can be found here:  
      * https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/research/user-research/FL-Search-march2020/research-findings.md
      * https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/community-care/urgent-care/research/jun-2019/findings.md
      * https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/login/ds-logon/research/research_brief.md
      * https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/hca-2.0/research/user-testing/dashboard-updates/research-summary.md
      * Results in a deck [starting on slide 18 here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aaKDRSu_pPFCxQKoP0cXeHifkmCgZHlm-ZvtgwW5SsQ/edit)
   * Keep findings separate from recommendations. A finding might be “Users didn’t seem to see the “Next” button on the page,” but discuss what to do about that in a separate, “Recommendations” section
6. Share insights with your team, and brainstorm recommendations. Then add a “recommendations” section/s to your Github page and final presentation deck. Note, if you’d like to add recommendations prior to sharing with your team, that’s fine too but make sure to get their input and ideas as a part of the process.
   * E.g. a recommendation for the above insight might be “Move the button higher on the page” or “Make the button more prominent” or “Remove the button and make it a single page.”
7. Add your research study to the [history of past research page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/research-history.md)
