## <a id="process"></a>VA.gov Base Process
There is a basic process we should use when planning and implementing research within the VSA contract.  DSVA’s updated process document can be found [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/June2019_updated_research_process.md). Please read that process doc first and then read the rest of this one for more tips/details.

## <a id="setup"></a>Setup
Make sure to create a folder in github under whatever “feature/flow” you’re working on E.g. “UrgentCare/Research/June-2019-Usability-Test/”  Where you can store you research plan, conversation guide, notes, and final results.  Read [this naming guide for further details](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/onboarding/repo-guidelines.md)

Create a [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/research_plan_template.md) and [Conversation Guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Request%20or%20Do%20Research/Planning%20and%20Process%20Management/Conversation-guide-template.md).

Note: after creating the final conversation guide, you may want to create a “note-taking template” in gitub as well, which you upload to your project folder, to help your note-takers.   

## <a id="recruiting"></a>Recruiting
**Note: It is not ok to try to recruit veterans “on the side” to do research on your own. You should go through Lauren Alexanderson if you want to talk to veterans in any way and get her approval on your plan.  She has worked hard to get us permission to talk to veterans at all, so we should not side step this process.**

VA has a partner organization (Perigeon) that does all the recruiting and scheduling for us. 
* They can schedule sessions either in person (in Fredericksburg, VA) or remotely. 
* They can find us Veterans, caregivers, service members, and dependents
* Information about using Perigean to recruit participants for your moderated user research studies [can be found here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Request%20or%20Do%20Research/PRA%20and%20Recruiting/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md).

If you want to use Perigean (and we usually do), contact Lauren Alexanderson, tell her you’re going to do research, and send her your [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/research_plan_template.md) and your [Conversation Guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Request%20or%20Do%20Research/Planning%20and%20Process%20Management/Conversation-guide-template.md)(new requirement that the conversation guide must be attached). 

Note: please cc Andre Zwilling of GCIO to your communication to Lauren so he knows a research session is happening.
Once Lauren has approved your plan, please add the line “This plan was reviewed and approved by Lauren Alexanderson on xx/xx/2019” at the bottom of the plan itself on Github

Veterans often will not show up to sessions. Try to schedule 1.5X more people than you need, with the expectation that people will not show.
To talk to stakeholders or VA employees that are working on the other side of the forms, we should go through our stakeholders.  Note that it’s fine to go casually talk to VA employees as long as we aren’t paying them.  

## <a id="pilot-sessions"></a> Pilot / Test Session
You should run a pilot/test session before your study. This session should be done with Perigeon so you go through the process of logging in for the first (or fortieth) time, get any kinks worked out, and understand how to hand off mouse controls or have a participant show their screen in the practice run.  Reach out to VSP to help coordinate the pilot.

## <a id="taking-notes"></a> Taking Notes
* Since we have to be so careful with recordings, we expect you to have a colleague that is taking verbatim notes during the session. This can be another designer, or another member of your team. Perigean will also take verbatim notes for your project, if requested.
* [Guidance on notetaking can be found here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Request%20or%20Do%20Research/Scheduling%20and%20Running%20Sessions/How-to-take-session-notes.md)
* We recommend creating a “notes” file within your github folder and storing each session as an .md document.  We recommend copying the conversation guide over to your .md file beforehand  so it’s easier to take notes.
* Make sure to scrub your notes of all PII before uploading to Github
* An [example of verbatim notes can be found here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/research/discovery-aug-2019/notes/px.md).

## <a id="recording"></a>Recorded Interviews
* You must get verbal consent from your participant in the recording itself. What this means is you ask if it’s ok, press record, then say something like “confirming on the recording that you are ok with this session being recorded.”
* You must press “record” yourself in the meeting software if you want your session recorded
* In Zoom during a session, check under the Meetings tab and select Recorded
* If you can’t find them, message your Perigean contact
* Download any recordings you need, but only keep for as long as necessary to complete synthesis. Then securely dispose of them.
* You can make clips of the recordings for sharing/presentations as long as those don’t contain PII
* **DO NOT upload any recordings on the cloud or anywhere else. There is probably PII disclosed in the recordings.**   

[Notes about what (not to) do with recordings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Request%20or%20Do%20Research/Synthesis/what-to-do-with-recordings.md) 

## <a id="running-sessions"></a>Running the Sessions
* You may hear hard stories from veterans.  It’s OK to sympathize with the participant. Saying something like “I’m so sorry you had to go through that” is perfectly acceptable after hearing a story before moving on to your task or follow-up.
* Make sure to ask open-ended questions and avoid Yes/No prompts. 
* Follow-up with “Why?” and “Tell me more” if the user has given you a short statement / not enough information
* Avoid saying "Thank you for your service" to Veterans, as some have a negative association with that phrase
* There is a channel in DSVA Slack called #feedback-backchannel.  Make sure to be in that channel when running your sessions and that your observers know about it.
   * Type “observer instructions” in the channel at the beginning of your day of sessions to give them tips
   * [Observer instructions can also be found here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Request%20or%20Do%20Research/Scheduling%20and%20Running%20Sessions/howto-observer-instructions.md)
   * At the end of your session, take a look at the feedback backchannel and see if anyone brought up questions that you can address with your participant


## <a id="synthesis"></a>Synthesis
Note that we expect synthesis to take about a week or “6 business days.”  If you think you need more time, talk to Shawna.  

I would recommend the following process, although you can modify if you like:
1. At the end of each day of research, schedule a “debrief” session where you invite all the observers to share the key takeaways from the sessions. Keep track of these key takeaways.
2. Once all the research is done and all debriefs have been conducted, create a [“topline summary”](https://portigal.com/reading-ahead-topline-summary/) that captures all the key themes people mentioned coming out of the sessions.
3. Share the [topline summary](https://portigal.com/reading-ahead-topline-summary/) with necessary stakeholders / the team and ask if they feel anything was missing based on their observations, and what they would like you to dig into when you conduct your detailed synthesis.
Note: Make sure to caveat the topline summary by saying that detailed synthesis has not yet been done, so things might morph and change a bit once it’s done.
4. Synthesize your research. I typically will do this with a modified [affinity mapping](https://generalassemb.ly/design/user-experience-design/affinity-mapping) activity.  I will create a simple spreadsheet, and pull quotes and behaviors from each participant into the spreadsheet. I then will “code” the quote or behavior with a relevant category.  I’ll move through each participant and revise codes as more insights start coalescing. You can look at a [sample of this from my Master’s thesis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ngx67-7vvVPeIZYgjX8pTP8w0aEED6I1lz_wJY6wR5Q/edit#gid=210944681) long long ago :) . You can also do a more standard affinity-mapping style synthesis on a Miro or Mural board, by putting quotes/behaviors on stickies and grouping them.
5. Take those themes and turn them into a research results document. This should typically be a github page as well as a presentation. You can see examples [if you scroll down to the “resources” section here] (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Health%20care/UrgentCare/Research/June-2019/readme.md).  You can also see some research results [starting on slide 8 here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aaKDRSu_pPFCxQKoP0cXeHifkmCgZHlm-ZvtgwW5SsQ/edit)
   * Note the Github page with results should be up 6 business days after your last session.  Some more examples of that page:
      * https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/login/ds-logon/research/research_brief.md
      * https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Health%20care/UrgentCare/Research/June-2019/findings.md
      * https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Health%20care/HealthApplication/HCA%20Duplicate%20Submissions%20Updates/Discovery%20and%20Research/User%20Testing/Dashboard%20updates/Research%20summary.md
   * I typically like to have my results and/or presentation list the “Top 10 insights” from the study, then dig into those insights in the next slides/sections.  
      * I like to keep “insights” separate from recommendations. So an insight might be “Users didn’t seem to see the “Next” button on the page”
6. Share the insights with your team, and brainstorm recommendations. At that point you can add a “recommendations” section/s to your github page and final presentation. Note, if you’d like to add the recommendations prior to sharing with your team, that’s fine too. Just make sure to get their input and ideas as well.
   * E.g. a recommendation for the above insight might be “Move the button up the page” or “Make the button more prominent” or “Remove the button and make it a single page”
7. Make sure to let Andre Zwilling of GCIO know when the results are posted
