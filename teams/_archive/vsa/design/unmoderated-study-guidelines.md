# Planning and Conducting Unmoderated Studies
**Prepared by:** Aricka Lewis, aricka@adhocteam.us

## What I Did
- Reached out to Lauren Alexanderson
  - There is no current documented process for conducting unmoderated research on the VSA contract and there have only been a couple of unmoderated studies performed
  - Unmoderated studies are not in our Perigean contract, so they are not a regular part of the VSA research process
- Create Research Plan
  - Followed the template as provided in the VSA Research documentation
- Create the Card Sort in OptimalSort
  - Included a short questionnaire at the end asking demographic questions relevant to the study
  - Included one short answer question for participants to provide a code given to them by Perigean 
- Draft Recruitment Email
  - Be clear about what the participant should expect and what sort of study it is
  
## Recruitment Process
1. Draft recruitment email
2. Perigean will send out an interest email to Veterans
3. Veterans respond to the email and receive a link to the sort and code
4. After the sort, Veteran provides the code in the questionnaire after the sort
5. Send codes to Perigean every few days
6. Perigean sends another recruitment email (if needed)

## Tips & Recommendations
- Write thorough instructions for the sort
  - Many participants mentioned that the OptimalSort instructions were difficult to understand
  - Potentially do a hybrid sort in order to give participants a better understanding of what to do
- Donâ€™t create more than 30 cards
  - The cognitive load for sorting more than 30 cards is heavy and may also result in low esteem from participants and abandonment of the exercise
- Plan ahead to optimize time
  - Leave the sort open for 14 days if possible (one sprint) and use the time to work on other initiative while the study is open
- Recruit for double the number of participants you want
  - Abandonment numbers were high for our study
  - We sent multiple recruitment emails to reach our goal
