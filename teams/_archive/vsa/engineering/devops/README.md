*Last updated: [11/18/2019](#document-history)*

The VSA team is committed to provide the best service available so our Veterans can enjoy fast and reliable access to our state-of-the-art applications and services.

VSA will accomplish this by integrating their resources to the current VSP Triage and DevOps process therefore reducing the cost by reusing the current set process and enhancing the collaboration between VSP and VSA.
