# QA Capacity & Tasks

---

**Update 2022-11-28**: We're onboarding a new Shared-Support QA Specialist right now.  Our support offerings will be expanding soon, so **watch this page**!

Shared-Support-QA capacity limitations preclude handling all the QA testing concerns outlined by Platform.

## Who should read this?

- Product Managers
- Front-end engineers
- Back-end engineers

## Testing-types & assignments/deputizations
The matrix below illustrates the current reality of what Shared-Support QA can consistently handle, and what VA Application Teams are unavoidability "deputized" to perform themselves:

| Task | Shared-Support QA\* | App Teams |
| ------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| [Manual testing](manual-ui-testing-process.md) [for Platform Staging Reviews] | :heavy_check_mark: | |
| Unit testing | | :heavy_check_mark: |
| [E2E testing](ptems-qa-e2e-testing.md) (incl. [Regression](ptems-qa-regression.md)) |  | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Load testing | | :heavy_check_mark: |

\*This matrix will be updated if/when staffing increases.

## QA Shift-Left initiatives

Although earlier QA-involvment in Build phase is currently as-capacity-permits, you're encouraged to include Shared-Support QA for the following development aspects:

- Design Intent -- invite a QA Specialist as Optional to your DI meetings w/ Platform
- E2E tests -- ping QA Specialist for advice and/or hands-on help

Shared-Support QA will make all reasonable efforts to accommodate your requests, as capacity permits.
