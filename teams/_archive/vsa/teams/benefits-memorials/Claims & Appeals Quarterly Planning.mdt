Goals
1. Release MVP - NOD 
2. Original claims form 526ez - Iteration 3 (research and design work first, while Anna (and new engineer) tackle bugs). We prioritize from there.
   1. Enhancements (based on Kevin’s data, research starting now)
   2. Look for errors
   3. Error remediation
      1. Bugs in sentry
      2. Veteran survey (research?)
      3. Call center feedback (we need to establish methodology for handling call center issues)
   4. 2 forms that aren’t launched
   5. PTSD issue implementation
   6. Form changes
   7. Accessibility issues
3. Claims Status Tool (3rd quarter) (mobile team working on this for mobile devices)
   1. Another team working on metrics
   2. Research has revealed some bugs and issues we want to address
   3. Data integrity
   4. Content / messaging
   5. Improving user experience (full redesign or additional data availability)
   6. We need good test users
   7. Data sources / discovery
      1. We pull from 2 APIs and only 1 is documented
      2. Take sample of prod data
      3. Have Matt lean on EVSS to document API (Anna providing url)
      4. End to end test systems - Cypress transition
4. Letters
   1. Assess errors
5. Burials
   1. Assess errors
6. Documentation (at the end of NOD and post to GitHub)
   1. Why we made decisions
7. Outliers: 
   1. HLR iteration 2
      1. Test users, make decision dates dynamic (currently set to expire in a year)
      2. Accessibility issues
      3. Supporting Legacy Appeal Opt-ins
   2. NOD iteration 2
      1. Uploading supporting evidence after the fact
8. Celebrate releases!!!! 




Constraints
* Staffing
* Contact center support
   * Initially, dedicate a month to addressing issues and hopefully this will reduce
   * Anna can train other engineers and we will then rotate support
   * Have contact center add labels to tickets (1 ticket per issue)
