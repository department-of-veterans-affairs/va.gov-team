# Goal
When we set up the [App Name] page we built the Redux code so that it would be able to be connected to the API endpoint set up by back end. We need to connect Redux on [App Name] to the endpoint that has been set up.

## Considerations
- [Swagger docs]()


## Tasks
- [] Adjust Redux action so that it hits a real URL and returns the data
- [] Adjust Redux reducer so that it accesses the correct data
- [] Submit a PR for review

## Acceptance criteria
- [] Data for [App Name] is now being pulled from the back end instead of a static file in the front end
- [] A PR has been submitted for review
