# Potential Research for Unauth
Cindy Merrill, Senior Researcher, Mar 2021
## Research Questions
### Overall
* Why do Veterans come to VA.gov? With what goals/tasks in mind?
* Do Veterans read/notice/click on the banner content on the home page?
* How do Veterans currently try to find what they’re looking for on VA.gov?
  * What have they looked for recently and how? 
    * Search and/or browse?
    * Where do they start typically? Google? Facebook?
    * 4 white quadrants? Topics below the photos? Footer? Header (mega-menus/dropdowns for benefit hubs)?
    * Any differences when using desktop vs. mobile?
    * Any differences between people who have used VA.gov before and those you have not? (recruit for both)
  * Do they find what they need? If not, what were they looking for? 
* What are the biggest pain points?
* What are the most-asked questions at the VA call center? 
### Search
- Which of the multiple search boxes on VA.gov do Veterans use? (global site search in header, Resources and Support, Find a Form, Find a Location, Find Yellow Ribbon school)
  - What Veterans think about searching on VA.gov?
  - Are Veterans aware of any of the search tools besides Global search? (all the others are pretty new and haven’t really been advertised)
  - What feedback do Veterans have on the search tools? Too many? Confused about which to use, or do they only use one? If only one, which one?
  - What do analytics tell us? Are all of these search methods being used?
  - *My hypothesis: Veterans just want to find what they’re looking for, and don’t want to choose from multiple ways to search unless it helps them get better results.*
- Get feedback on usability of search--findability, usage, pain points
- Get feedback on usability of search results
- (new) Get feedback on typeahead suggestions when typing search queries (understandable as suggestions, not options that you have to select from?)
### Resources & Support
- Do Veterans use this search interface? Check analytics data and ask Veterans
- Do Veterans use the browsing interface (below the search box)? Check analytics data
- What is the coverage of the browsing interface vs. the browsing topics on VA.gov?
- Get feedback on usability--findability, usage, mobile experience, pain points (only way to get to is thru search results or link in footer)
- How do Veterans view this page or content? Its own site? Never seen before? Content same or different from VA.gov home page?
  - Any feedback on the name "Resources & Support"?
  - What do Veterans think about a "subscription or RSS feed" model where they could subscribe to content types and get notification when new content is added? 
- See if Veterans want to share content with others. Try out the new sharing link to see if Veterans understand it and how to paste the link (Cassandra 4/2021)
- On mobile, the search box and radio buttons are currently hidden to save screen real estate (per Ryan). Do users click on "Search resources and support" to uncover them? (Brian will check analytics) If we had them always visible like on desktop, will users scroll down to see the browsing topics below? (Cassandra 4/2021)
### Benefit Hubs 
(focused on the following dropdown links under "VA Benefits and Health Care" at the top of va.gov: Health care, Disability, Education and training, Careers and employment, Pension, Housing assistance, Life insurance, Burials and memorials)
- Do Veterans use this? Check analytics data and ask Veterans
- How do Veterans use this? (get info and leave? stay and browse?)
- Get feedback on usability--findability, usage, pain points
### Find a Form
- Do Veterans use this? Check analytics data and ask Veterans
- Get feedback on usability--findability, usage, pain points
### Find Yellow Ribbon school
- Do Veterans use this? Check analytics data and ask Veterans
- Get feedback on usability--findability, usage, pain points
- Any confusion with the GI Bill Comparison Tool? Do Veterans know which to use when?
## Next Steps
- Check analytics data to compare usage across unauth products 
- Talk to people to learn what the biggest pain points are
  - Call centers (Chante Lantos-Swett)--ask re question topics/themes
    - Review resources provided, reach out for intro to call center contacts, get report VA.gov topics/q's
  - Meg Peters (IA lead)
  - Danielle and Beth (content leads)
- Gather the most important unauth user tasks from journey map & other sources
  - Talk to Meg Peters and Shawna + John re top tasks
  - Review reports from Jeff Barnes, Elissa Frankle Olinsky
- Determine what unauth research would be the most impactful in the near term
  - **How do Veterans navigate to find what they need on the VA.gov home page?** (i.e., search at top, browse dropdowns (top), 4 quadrants, topics below, CTAs below, links in footer (including Resources and support), google search)
  - **Test top tasks on VA.gov** (Meg wants to get top tasks from analytics, research how well Veterans do these tasks, ask about their top tasks) 
    - Include tasks that may involve Unauth products including Benefit hubs, Resources & support, Find a form, Find Yellow Ribbon school
    - What works well? What pain points are there? Opportunities for improvement?
  - **Baseline research across new products that haven’t been tested**
  - Research on products that support the most important user tasks 
  - Research on mobile as well as desktop
  - Research on Pittsburgh facilities nav vs. current VA.gov nav per Meg
  - Research on detailed content questions from Beth and Danielle (after incremental changes are done; they'll put compile a list), including possible confusion when jump into different content with different navigation/search
