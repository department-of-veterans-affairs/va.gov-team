# Content Brief Explained

See the [Content Brief template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/content-brief-template.md) we use.

## What’s the purpose of a content brief?

A content brief is a support document that guides designers and PMs in content creation as a product is in development. It helps to create a consistent experience for the user—within the  product and across VA.gov as a whole. This consistency builds trust with our Veterans, their dependents, and their caregivers.

## What’s in a content brief?

It captures everything from the big-picture decisions about messaging and VA partner requirements to the smaller details such as word choice and how to define terms that aren’t plain language. It summarizes how we want to talk to Veterans or dependents about a benefit or tool. It also documents the words or phrases we intentionally don’t want to use.

The guidance in a content brief is based on research findings, the VA.gov style guide, and VA partner/business requirements for the product in question.

## Who creates the content brief and who uses it?

The sitewide content team creates the content brief. After handoff to the product team, all team members may add to it and update it. This document tracks content decisions made throughout the course of the project. It’s a living document. It should be referred to regularly and amended as needed. The guidance contained in this document is specific to the product and also covers the basic style and voice guidelines from the VA.gov style guide.
