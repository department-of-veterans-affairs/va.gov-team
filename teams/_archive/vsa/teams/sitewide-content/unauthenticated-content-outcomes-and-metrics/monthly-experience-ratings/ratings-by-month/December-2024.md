## Analysis
[Resources and support ratings spreadsheet](https://dvagov-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/randi_hecht_va_gov/Documents/Documents/Analytics/Resources%20and%20supoort%20ratings%20tracking%20December%202024.xlsx?d=w0b91c19721d645148701b95ef454a22b&csf=1&web=1&e=rgf5yf)
- This is the fourth month in a row R&S didn't meet our goal of 75% or higher "good" ratings, with a 65% "good" average rating. This can be attributed to large numbers of "bad" ratings for sign-in related pages. This will most likely continue during the sign-in transition process but we will continue to monitor it.
- - Performance isn't as high when broken down to individual pages:
  - 32% of pages are scoring at 90% or higher "good"
  - 56% of pages are meeting our goal of 75% or higher "good," while 59% of pages are scoring 70% or higher
  - 21% of pages are scoring at less than 50% "good," with 3% scoring at less than 10% "good" 
- All of the lowest rated R&S pages (by lowest "good" rating percentage and highest volume of total responses with <50% "good" rating" were connected to sign-in. We'll continue to review Medallia feedback to determine if this has to do with the process or the content on the pages.
- Three of the 5 top rated pages were about burials and memorials.
- The PACT Act page continues to score high with a high number of views.
