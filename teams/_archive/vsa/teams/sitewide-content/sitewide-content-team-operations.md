# Sitewide Content operations

This document outlines the work Sitewide Content does and has links to various helpful documentation and standards for team members. 

## Standards and training

These are the basic quality and style standards that team members need to be familiar with:

## Incoming requests 
### Stakeholder requests
Stakeholders from the different VA benefit offices will reach out via VA email for changes or updates they want made to pages on VA.gov. 
[Review the list of VBA stakeholders](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/VBA%20Stakeholders.md)

Sometimes the stakeholder needs a phone number updated, a link or dollar amount changed on the page, or some other small fix. Other times, they're asking to add new information or rework content that's currently on the page. Within a day of the email, a Sitewide Content team member will reply to the stakeholder that we've received the email and will review the information and get back to them with further questions. The PM will create a ticket for the work and the content team will use the assessment criteria for updating existing pages to determine how best to proceed. <br>
[Read the assessment criteria for updating current VA.gov pages](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/processes/assessment-criteria-for-SME-requests.md)

**Note:** If the stakeholder is requesting a simple or small change (updating a link, changing a phone number or address, etc.) we don't need to send a preview link to the stakeholder before we publish. We can publish the change and then send the stakeholder a link to the live page once the update appears. 

We've shared with stakeholders our editorial process and how Sitewide Content collaborates with benefit offices to update VA.gov pages.

### Product team requests
Product teams request support from Sitewide Content. They may need help writing or editing an alert in their app or creating a brand-new landing page for the tool they'll be launching. They open a Sitewide Content and IA intake request form and may come to office hours to discuss what's needed. The Sitewide Content PM reviews this request and determines next steps. Beth and Danielle sometimes fulfill these requests with only copyediting input from the team. We use the intake request as the start of an epic and create individual tickets to track the content and IA work.<br>

## Work Sitewide Content is responsible for
Besides stakeholder requests and product team help, the content team works regularly on a few tasks:
- **We update different benefit rates annually.** [Read about our process for updating rates pages](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/how-to-do-different-tasks/how-to-update-rates-pages.md)
- **We update the number of days to complete disability claims monthly.** [Read about our process for updating the number of days to complete disability-related claims](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/how-to-do-different-tasks/updating-number-of-days-to-complete-disability-related-claims.md)
- **We update the COVID-19 pages (in English, Spanish, and Tagalog) and the COVID-19 chatbot.** COVID-19 changes always take priority over other work so we can get changes published quickly. [Read about our process for updating COVID-19 pages](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/translation-work/covid-translation-work-process.md)
- **We maintain the style guide.** Sometimes we find important rules missing from the style guide or we want to clarify or update information that's already there. [Read about our process for updating the style guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/how-to-do-different-tasks/how-to-update-the-style-guide.md)
- **We add entry points and update the left nav for new tools and forms added to VA.gov.** When a product team launches a new tool on VA.gov, the Sitewide Content team needs to add the entry points to the Drupal nodes (our existing pages). We often also update the left nav and top nav if there's a new static landing page. [Learn how to update the left nav](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/how-to-do-different-tasks/adding-left-nav-and-url.md)
- **We complete audits for specific content or components on VA.gov.** For example, if we need to update certain components for accessibility or we need to change a phone number or link across many pages, we need to audit the site to find every instance. Depending on whether we're auditing only static pages or we also need to include authenticated pages, we reach out to the CMS team or Public Websites to request their help.
