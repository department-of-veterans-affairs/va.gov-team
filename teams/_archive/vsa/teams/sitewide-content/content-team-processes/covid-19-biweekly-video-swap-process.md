## Process
1. Sign into Drupal.
2. Click on **Content**.
3. In the filter search field, type **Have questions before you get your COVID-19 vaccine?**.
4. Open the page and click on the **Edit** tab.
5. Scroll down to the **Stories** section.
6. For the first story, delete the **name**, **video link**, and remove **image**. (**Note:** You don’t have to delete “Air Force Veteran.”)
7. Search for image based on last name (ex: Victor for Patricia Victor). Select image to add.
8. Replace name and video link. (**Note:** You’ll alternate between two names. For example, if Patrica Victor was the featured Veteran for the last 2 weeks, Robert Bonner is the featured Veteran for the next 2 weeks.).
9. Repeat steps 6-8 for the Marine Corps Veteran. (**Note:** For Ronald Pipkins, search for his image using “Pipkin”).
