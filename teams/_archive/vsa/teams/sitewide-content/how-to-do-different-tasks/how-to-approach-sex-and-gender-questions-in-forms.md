If you're working on an online VA form that collects information about the Veteran's sex or gender, follow this guidance to help the form team approach this sensitive content.

1. First, ask SMEs if we actually need to collect this information. How does the business line use this information? Is it necessary to collect this in order to give the Veteran the benefit or service they're requesting? If not, suggest not collecting this information.
2. Next, confirm with SMEs whether the form intends to collect sex or gender. (Many older PDF forms ask for gender when they actually mean sex assigned at birth or sex listed on a legal document.)
    - **If it’s collecting gender,** use this [VADS pattern](https://design.va.gov/patterns/ask-users-for/gender).
    - **If it’s collecting sex,** use this [USWDS pattern](https://designsystem.digital.gov/patterns/create-a-user-profile/gender-identity-and-sex/). Confirm whether they need sex assigned at birth or sex listed on a legal document.
3. Ask form team to confirm how the answer options work in the backend system. If the backend system can't accomodate the answer options suggested in the VADS or USWDS pattern, adjust to follow the pattern as closely as possible while aligning with the backend system.

**Note:** If it's collecting sex, include a “why we need this information” or "how we use this information" additional info component **only if** the SMEs can provide a specific and valid answer. Don't invent or inflate reasons if none exist.
