## Situation

We scale the VA's digital services through VA.gov. New experiences are prioritized and existing experiences improved. <br>
Products are built and improved in part through various VA.gov teams, including VSA.<br><br>
We prioritize initiatives that support VA.gov’s role as the VA’s digital front door. 
These initiatives help Veterans and others to find, apply, track, and manage VA benefits. <br><br>
And, we know how critical feedback loops and regular reflection are in building a successful product organization.

## Opportunity 

We have an opportunity to share the impact of the things we work on more often.
Right now, it might be localized to a few people or a given team. 
That means we may not take advantage of quantitative results to drive future decision-making. 
And we it means we may not celebrate the impact we have on Veterans beyond the launch of a particular feature.

## Questions
- How do we intentionally reflect on the measurable impact of our work? How do we use these lessons to inform our path forward?

## Hypotheses
### First Fridays - Initiative Impact Review: 

Every initiative—a new feature, a product launch, technical improvements—wraps up with a) a look-back at the results of our hypotheses and b) recommendations for how we might proceed moving forward.

- Who attends? 
  - DEPO leads, VSA Practice leads, DEPO team leads, VSA PMs
- What happens?
  - The VSA PM debriefs the team on a launched initiative:
      - Problem
      - Solution Approach / Hypotheses
      - Results for Veteran, Business, Technology
      - Recommendations
- When will this happen?
    - First Friday of each month
- How do we get started?
    - [VSA Initiative Impact Review Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yq7dPPf65qHCJaD6e6bWdTyl1VoCC0gnLdcyOhgaSuM/edit#slide=id.p1)
    - The [VSA Product Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jvhpBgG-MtHFKoCW3WnEhsE-5oPoQxcj0gDOYFwBBL8/edit?folder=1YkkOe5w3sVA0KaW0DtgCFvQy6oVfycng#gid=1522365621) should contain the data you need to present
    
 
    
 ## Narrative
 ### Launch our first Impact Review on 5/1 

   * Presenters
     - Facilities (Urgent Care MVP), Authenticated Experience (Direct Deposit, Address Validation), eBenefits (Rated Disabilities) teams
   * What we hope to learn:
     - KPIs - Survey scores
     - Did we influence future decision-making?
     - whether this should be a combined VSA/DEPO PM/PO exercise or just VSA PM
   * Results
     - On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend Impact Reviews to your teammates/colleagues/others?:
       - Avg. 8.75
     - Anecdotes
       - "...bigger screenshots or switching between the presentation/actual VA.gov next time would be helpful so everyone has better context of the work!"
       - "We might need to invite more people...but at the same time, I don't want it to be too enormous"
       - "...would be beneficial to add questions that are asked/commentary to the questions slide..."
       - "...felt some relief at finally seeing initiatives highlighted and talked about in a way that was more about the "overall veteran experience" and not discrete "features""

 ### Subsequent iterations
 
 * Delegated to Michelle
 * Grew attendees list
 * Impact Review "Style Guide"
 * Promote more critical questions re: our insights and conclusions
