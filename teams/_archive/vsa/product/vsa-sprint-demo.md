# Sprint Demo Guide
Each VSA product team has the opportunity to share things they’re most excited about from the past sprint with OCTO-DE, Platform, VSA Leads, and other VSA teams. The goal—greater awareness of each other’s work to foster collaboration and shared learnings.

## Format
Sprint Demo is scheduled for Tuesday, 1-2:30pm ET on the last day of each sprint. Teams have a few minutes depending on the agenda to share things they’re most excited about— less can be more!​ We wrap up with any announcements from VSA leadership or OCTO-DE. 

## Facilitator Guide

Faciliators serve as MC and should be mindful of keeping the pace of Demo moving. That does not mean rushing participants. It does mean keeping an eye on time and how overelaborate (or not) a particular share is and using judgment to prompt folks with questions and thoughts as appropriate.

### Rotations
We rotate facilitators between VSA PMs each month. [Facilitation Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f4Ld-zXFrTyYv8o2mc1x7CNIc4VEmhCwNOUxoVFW6r4/edit#gid=0)

_:information_source: the next PM on the schedule is backup if the facilitator can’t make it to a particular Demo_

### Pre-Demo
- Make sure we have a new slide deck created (see [Appendix](#Appendix) for instructions)
- Check with VSA Leads (Shawna, Yana, Andre, Jeff, Mickin) for any announcements they (or OCTO-DE) may have
- Confirm the deck is updated by teams with items they’re demoing
  - If teams don’t have any items, _they_ should remove their slides/update the agenda
  - The Platform Design System team attends and occasionally shares at Demo. 
    - They’ll typically reach out with any topic/presenter (via DM or #vsa, #vsa-product) which you can add to their slide.
    - If not, remove their slide and name from the agenda.

_:information_source: The Sprint Demo is auto-recorded. You don’t need to do anything._

#### Demo Tempo
Sprint Demo is scheduled for 1.5 hrs. With ~15 teams and ~10 min of opening/closing buffer, that leaves ~5 minutes per team if **every** team demos. Not every team demos each sprint. Regardless, ~6-7 minutes ends up being a reasonable allotment. 

### During Demo
- Open up Demo with welcoming remarks and remind folks of the format including the focus, the time limit, and to take any questions to #vsa in DSVA Slack.  
- Introduce each team, their participants, and their topic before turning it over to the respective team
- Prompt attendees for any questions they may have 
- Move on to remaining teams before wrapping up with closing remarks and announcements

### Post-Demo
All set! Yana will post the recording in #vsa

## Participant Guide

### Pre-demo
- Confirm with your team what you’d like to share and update your team’s slide accordingly 
- If you don’t have anything to demo, remove your team’s slide and update the agenda **by end-of-day Monday** before Demo
- Get ready for Demo with any artifacts, etc. you may want to share

### During Demo
- Share your Demo item including context about how your work fits into larger product objectives/direction
- Be mindful of the time limit
  - Certain topics like research shares should focus on the objectives and top findings/recommendations whereas engineering shares should have machines prepped

_:bulb: Consider a slide deck for research shares, mockups/prototypes for design shares, a video recording for engineering shares, analytics or documentation for product shares._
