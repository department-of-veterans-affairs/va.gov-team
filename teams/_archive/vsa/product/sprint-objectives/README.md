# VSA Sprint Objectives Guide
[_Adapted from VSP Sprint Objectives Rules of Engagement_](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/rroueche-patch-2/teams/vsp/sprint-objectives/sprint-objectives-roe.md)

There are a handful of goals for VSA Sprint Objectives:

`1.` By developing and publishing them, Sprint Objectives serve as a gut check that your prioritizations and the evolution of your products are in line with VSA's strategic objectives.

`2.` Give DSVA an idea of what each product team is focused on and why (i.e. the impact you hope to achieve with that work) so they can provide feedback based on their priorities and based on other VA-wide info they may be aware of.

`3.` Surface opportunities for cross-collaboration, and spur cross-team discussion where needed.

## How to brainstorm Sprint Objectives

1. Review VSA's Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and your own team's OKRs to think about how you want to align to the overall strategy. These OKRs should be consistent with those found on your respective roadmaps. 
1. Review DSVA recommendations to see if there’s anything your product team wants to contribute
1. Review your product team's Backlog to see if there’s anything high priority to start pulling in
1. Review prior sprint to see if any work needs to continue, or if you need to change course to align per above
1. Check your team’s upcoming PTO to see if you need to cut back accordingly
1. Check anticipated support needs, and when high volume is expected, cut back on commitments accordingly

## How to write Sprint Objectives
- Orient your Sprint Objectives under an appropriate initiative-specific sub-header e.g. "Direct Deposit" or "View Rated Disabilities".
- In *plain language*, state an intended outcome and value proposition, *not* an individual task (like you'd find in GitHub).
- They should usually be small enough that they won't stay the same every sprint for the next 3 sprints.
- Don't be _too_ ambitious in the volume and scope for the sprint, leave about 20% space for unexpected work or challenges.
- Move any good ideas that you want to keep track of but won't be focusing on this sprint to your ZenHub backlog to evaluate in the future.

_Note: if your objectives map 1:1 to GitHub issues, that's an indicator that the objectives are not correct._

## Cadence
- Have regular scheduled meetings to evaluate your backlog and groom epics/initiatives, so you're not grooming during Sprint Planning later.

- In days leading up to the end of the Sprint:
  - Friday: start brainstorming potential sprint objectives
  - Monday: Draft your objectives for internal and DSVA review
  - Tuesday: review DSVA's feedback and share with your product team (if not already shared)
  - Wednesday: do Sprint Planning, using the objectives as your guide for which GitHub issues should be in the Current Sprint.
  - Wednesday (post-Sprint Planning): Submit finalized objectives for DSVA and team awareness

## How to update Sprint Objectives for the Report
- Add a status symbol in front of each objective for your team
- Link each objective to an artifact (a VA.gov page in staging or prod, a mockup, etc.) or to a GH issue (if "artifact" doesn't make sense)
- For any objectives that you think might not be complete this sprint, in italics below it, describe why and what you've done about it (deprioritize and put in your backlog? continue next sprint? pivot to different approach? pass to another team?)
