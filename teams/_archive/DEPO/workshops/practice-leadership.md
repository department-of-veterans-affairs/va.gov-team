# Practice leadership workshop brief

The purpose of this workshop is not to _resolve_ the problem space described below, but rather to pinpoint the gaps (in people, skills, policy, etc) that OCTO-DE / OCTO needs to figure out how to fill in order to start improving this problem space.

## Problem space brief

We have a handful of highly skilled individuals at OCTO-DE who are experts in a given field (notably content, accessibility, IA, design, and research) and to whom we look as the protectors of those practices on VA.gov. The term "practice lead" came about organically, grassroots-style, as a way to describe and wrap heads around these people and their role here, however there was never an intentional OCTO-DE creation of this role nor a conscious accepting of this role by these individuals. There's never been any explicit definition of what it means to have this role - what the expectations and responsibilities are, what the needs are for success, and really whether it's indeed these peoples' role at all. All of this results in mismatched understandings of what practice leads and Collab Cycle members or VFS Teams or VA.gov members at large expect of each other, and has been the source of much confusion and frustration.

## How might we...
...define what responsibilities we need covered by the practice leadership space, and where we have gaps, so OCTO and DE leadership have the context they need to define roles and org structure?

## Workshop goals
- Understand the full gamut of what our VA.gov ecosystem needs from practice leadership
- Understand what the current individuals in these roles _want_ to be spending their time on (and what they don't want to be spending their time on)
- Understand some preliminary prioritization from the OCTO-DE viewpoint of those responsibilities
- Understand what gaps we need to fill

## Questions the workshop should answer
- What are VFS teams asking of practice leads today?
- What are Collab Cycle members asking of practice leads today?
- What are OCTO-DE folks asking of practice leads today?
- What work do the practice leads do today that they weren't expecting to?
- What things are practice leads doing today that they believe should be done by someone else? (and is that a different existing entity, or a net new role?)
- In what ways do the current practice leads feel blocked?
- What would practice leads like to be doing that they don't have bandwidth for today?
- What does support look like for the current people in the practice lead roles to be able to execute on their visions / plans / initiatives?

## Desired post-workshop outcomes
- Inform ideation around how to fill those gaps
- Inform role definitions and hiring decisions
- Inform how practice area roles should fit into the crew structure and OCTO / OCTO-DE organizational structure
- Set expectations across the ecosystem about this role, and thusly reduce frustration, swirl, and burnout.

## How this workshop intersects with other efforts happening at OCTO
There's work being done to stand up Community of Practice Leads within OCTO, and those individuals are meant to be people managers. The information from this workshop should act as background context to help those individuals best support the needs of practice-leadership-related roles, and craft an org structure that empowers those types of roles well to do the responsibilities that get defined.

There's also work being done around the concept of practice area operations roles: folks to consult with VFS teams on their work in the given practice area, and to maintain our process and say "ok we've grown, let's rethink how we do xyz method or process or task." This will be incorporated into the _understanding the full gamut_ and _gaps_ parts of the workshop as things that current practice leads in some areas have already identified, and already have started ideating around.

There's also a new 3-bucket design strategy being worked on focused on process improvements and process clarity for design collaboration, thus reducing some pain for the design practice lead.

## More detail on why this is a problem that needs solving

### Practice leads are feeling pain

**What are they supposed to be doing? There's too much!**
- The lack of clarity around what OCTO wants them to be spending their time on feels debilitating sometimes
- They find themselves often in an arbitration position that they didn't ask for: a VFS team builds a thing that doesn't meet our standards, the collab cycle points it out, but escalates to the practice lead to be the ultimate enforcer if there's disagreement from the VFS side. These are often complex things on which they have no background, yet are expected to make recommendations.
- They often get roped into taking on actual implementation work for VFS teams, as opposed to focusing on overall strategy and providing best practices guidance.
- They get pulled into this or that high priority OCTO-DE initiative, but should they be prioritizing that? Or should they be prioritizing catching off-the-rails stuff happening on VA.gov work? Or supporting VFS teams with implementation?

**They don't have the support they need, and their work sometimes feels at odds with OCTO-DE culture**
- It's frustrating that it seems like OCTO-DE is still just building new stuff all over the place making the site more and more fragmented -- feels like feature bloat instead of strategic evolution. As practice leads, it feels like our _ship ship ship_ culture is at odds with what they're here to do, and it's frustrating.
- Thought the new crews concept would make this better, but it hasn't.
- Mantra has been "ship ship ship, deliver deliver deliver, because the _worst_ thing we deliver will be better than anything Veterans currently have." But that's not true anymore since we have a critical mass of things that work well.
- It seems really hard to get funding for the "boring" shit (they've proposed ideas for ways to improve the culture of their craft across the organization, but haven't been able to get $ or people to actually implement.)
- It feels degrading to get asked "what do you think should be a priortiy and what do you need to do that?" and then never hear anything back about it, yet get asked to report on progress. If OCTO-DE thinks the proposed priorities are wrong, then say that. But to be asked monthly about the progress that you're making on things for which you were never given the supported needed to execute on, it's making people feel totally burned out.
- Some are VA employees now (instead of USDS / PIF) and they're visioning for the longer term. Meanwhile, USDSers or PIFs want to make a big bang in their short amount of time here, but that can harm the longer term vision and work -- and they don't have as much of a stake in the long term as VA employees do

**The "goodness" of the things being built here seems tenuous, but it's overwhelming for one person to oversee all of it**
- We've officially stated that the OCTO-DE Product Owner has final say, and in disagreement cases it gets escalated to Crew Chief. But practice leads are scared to let go of keeping tabs on all the work happening across VA.gov and sticking up for their practices, because it seems there are bad things squeaking through too frequently. These single individuals scrubbing in to "fix" bad stuff isn't scalable though.
- Does OCTO / OCTO-DE want practice leads to be more lording over the contract / VFS progress and raising more flags about what's not going well? If so, it needs to be communicated strongly and widely. Not one little post a long time ago in a channel that not everyone's in.

### Collab cycle members are feeling pain
- They often fill in the gap in implementation help when a VFS team doesn't have the appropriate skills, or when the practice lead doesn't have the bandwidth. It's taxing to have to either pick up that extra work because they want to be helpful, or alternatively explain that essentially there's no one to help and the team's out of luck.
- They sometimes spend time and energy providing reviews of VFS work, when unbeknownst to them the practice lead has either already given a separate OK, or is still working with the VFS team on their strategy - this leads to wasted collab cycle member efforts and they have limited bandwidth already so can be pretty frustrating.

### VFS team members are feeling pain
- Have to redo work on their feature/product (sometimes kind of late in the game) if they get different feedback from practice leads than what they're getting in collab cycle. This is on top of the normal iterations/changes made based on usability findings and VA business stakeholder reviews.
- It's a bit of a blocker for teams to have just one person reviewing all their research plans.
- There are no IA people on any VFS team, yet we ask those teams to do their own IA strategy and definition. They don't have the skillsets or global knowledge necessary to be able to really make well-informed IA decisions.
