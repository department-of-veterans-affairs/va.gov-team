VA's Campaign Landing Pages (CLP) don't really fit what we think of as a VFS. They're more of a marketing tool that VA uses to drive awareness of various programs or messages. OCTO-DE is taking that work on in order to help out some important partners inside VA. As such, John H and Rachael R have made a decision on what the scope of Platform's involvement should be:

The only support the Platform will provide for CLP is basic analytics dashboarding and accommodation of UTM for the campaigns. Aside from that, all other platform support is out of scope (including collab cycle).
