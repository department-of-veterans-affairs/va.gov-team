## Who should be responsible for training editors?
- Public websites? CMS Product Support? Platform Product Support? VFS Accessibility folks?
- Martha is a domain expert, but has no team to do anything (though it sounds like there may be some a11y experts coming on board through a vendor soon?)
- Is anyone at CMS Product Support expert enough to actually train people in a11y? We think no.
- How are they getting trained in how to write in plain language etc? We think they're not today.
- Dave has talked about setting up a whole system: requiring that folks get certified etc before they get access to Drupal. But there's no one (leadership or team) to build that vision. 
- Platform crew has creating trainings on our roadmap for June 2020, we could collab with Dave around that time to optimize our trainings to suit the needs of VA Editors.
- Platform crew has an axe core training we do that we oculd offer to VA Editors if that would suit their need
- If neither of the above 2 options are ok, we'll need to figure something else out -- maybe chat with Jen to see if a short term training stopgap would be something she'd be interested in leading and launching?

## What do we need to do in order to support the needs of the Tier 3 initiative?
- Jen is exploring the current Editors experience, what they're used to, their mental model, and the delta between that and our model
- We'll likely have to have trainings of some kind across all practice areas (content, IA, a11y, human-centered design, etc)
- If our strategy is to bring all web users to Drupal CMS so they can retire TeamSite in a year, that is a huge thing. Is that what we're going to become? The Enterprise CMS for VA?
    - We need to talk with Chris and Jeff about the relative priority of this.
    - Are we comfortable directing teams away from current work to support this? Because it needs dedicated strategic leadership team + implementation teams and it has neither of those today.
    - Need to map out the priority user stories, the features needed, rough timelines, and change management plan.
