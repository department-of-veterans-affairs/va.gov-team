# CMS Accelerated Publishing

## How does this fit into Platform Crew strategy
- Fits in the Autonomous Deployment objective (aka big rock)
    - Could be a CMS Core App KR and an initiative on their roadmap
    - One goal of discovery is to determine what people and skills are needed

## Strategic concerns
- Starting discovery without a team hired to own the CMS build seems like we're just repeating the CMS discovery spike from last year that led us here
    - CMS is leading discovery now (as opposed to VSP leading it last time).
    - Before there wasn’t clear ownership, this time there is.
- Nervous about having implementation on the roadmap
    - Don’t want to unintentionally make a promise to stakeholders when we don't know yet what the LOE will be, and don't yet have the people we need to do the work (i.e. node.js developers) on the contract
- Don't like that we have an arbitrary date for this.
    - Aribtrary dates aren't helpful when we use them as the keystone that determines whether or not we launch a thing.
    - But dates _are_ helpful in providing clarity around the size/scope of solution we’re hoping for, and for driving a group toward a clear goal together.

## What are we asking CMS Core App to do?
- Want to get concrete value out of discovery
    - Example: even clear documentation current build process would be a win
- Discovery seems fine now, but what’s our post-discovery plan (knowing it’ll be largely informed by discovery)?
- VA is expecting 3-5 min publishing time in 6 months, but focusing on _that_ singularly for discovery could be a disservice
    - The natural pressures of the client - vendor relationship are such that, if we ask for that, we will get a plan for that. No one wants to say to the client "we can't do that" or "yes but this other thing would be better," because it doesn't often go over well. So how can we reframe what we're asking for to allow for alternative solutions to the underlying problems to be explored, and for realistic understanding of what 3-5 min publishing LOE would _really_ be? 
    - Example: there are some good ideas out there for 15 min publishing time, but we throw them out bc it’s not 5 min.
    - Want to make sure this option is on the table for post-discovery: we take on little improvements to current infra, instead of focusing 100% on a months-away big bang launch
    - Given the actual problem (per Jenny H-L feedback), it seems like we could make their lives a lot easier with shorter-term, lower-risk work that's not the 3-5 min publishing time work. Want to make sure we explore that.

## Actions
- Write up our vision for post-discovery, so it can be incorporated into discovery and socialize with the discovery team.
-	Consider integrating something into prioritization frameworks used in discovery like “would this also help in the short term?” so we can see what things would be only helpful for the long term big bang 3-5 min solution, vs things that would incrementally provide value wile also getting us toward the long term goal.
-	Review Mike’s updates around integrating foundational research w/Jenny H-L and similar stakeholders into discovery.
