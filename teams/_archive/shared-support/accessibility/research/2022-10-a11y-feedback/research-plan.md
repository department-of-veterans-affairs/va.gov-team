## Background
One of the key goals of the modernized VA.gov a11y strategy document is to center and include disabled Veterans (and by extension their caregivers and family members and/or disabled caregivers and disabled family members). Two barriers come to mind:

1. We currently only recruit disabled Veterans for usability testing research, for which the primary purpose is evaluating products as they are being worked on. 
2. We are unclear about the degree to which disabled Veterans participate in the VA's existing feedback methods; it is possible that disabled Veterans find these feedback methods to be inaccessible, thereby limiting their ability to provide feedback that can inform our understanding of their broader needs, gaps in products, and issues with the VA.gov website. 

To address that gap, we would like to establish a process to collect accessibility (a11y) feedback from the public.

## Research Goals
Our goal is to establish a process to collect a11y feedback from the public. In order to accomplish this goal, we need to…
- determine whether disabled Veterans are providing feedback through existing feedback mechanisms (and if not, why not?), and
- start to gain preliminary insight or determine next steps on how to gain insights into disabled Veteran's behaviors, feelings, perspectives, and expectations on providing a11y feedback

## Focus areas
- How accessible (and to a degree usable) are current feedback methods on VA.gov? 
- Where do disabled Veterans currently provide or expect to be able to provide a11y feedback on VA.gov (if at all)?
- What are all the current existing mechanisms (accessible or not)?
- What kind of a11y feedback do disabled Veterans provide (or want to provide) on VA.gov? 
- Do some subgroups (or individuals) among disabled Veterans have a greater need (if at all) for providing and resolving accessibility feedback more than others?
- How is a11y feedback for VA.gov currently processed?
- What mental models do disabled Veterans have of the a11y feedback process on VA.gov?

## Constraints, Assumptions, and Risks
This is bootstrapped research with little to no formal funding (yet), we currently cannot conduct an independent qualitative study. We can however add on or append to existing studies with disabled Veterans, interview key informants (who aren’t Veterans from the public), and investigate existing processes.
As we can only append to existing studies or rely on secondary research and key informants, we are limited in who and how we sample. In other words, any insights from this research cannot be established as broader, representative patterns. They can only be interpreted as localized events. For example, if we hear that several Veterans are using the Medallia feedback button, we cannot assume that it is representative of all disabled Veterans, but we can conclude that some Veterans are using it and fund more time into investigating it further.

### Assumptions
- Disabled Veterans have an interest in providing feedback in the first place (we’ll look to prove/disprove this) 
- Disabled Veterans are actively accessing and using VA.gov 

#### Disabled Veterans are a big tent, so we’ll need to be strategic with sampling
- When we refer to “disabled” in disabled Veteran, we are referring to any Veteran that either identifies with or has been diagnosed with a disability. This may range from Veterans with minor temporary disabilities like migraines, to Veterans with acquired permanent disabilities like TBI or blindness, and Veterans with congenital (from birth) disabilities.
- As a starting point, we may be interested in determining through secondary research (e.g., SME interview with Tim Hornik from the Blinded Veterans Association) if there are any particular subgroups (if at all) that are more likely to provide or need a response from accessibility feedback.
- We’ll want to pay close attention to patterns and differences between different types of disabilities while also acknowledging that no one disabled person is alike. 

## Methodology
We intend on using mixed methods to begin to investigate the research focus areas including:

### Desk research 
- Contact center surveys, extracting survey responses from Veterans based on keywords related to accessibility).
- Page analytics, use google analytics to explore quantitative data related to accessibility searchers, use of Section 508 page, and more.

### Accessibility audits 
Identifying known existing methods of providing feedback and auditing them based on VA.gov platform standards.

### Interviews with Veterans
Append questions to the end of interviews with disabled Veterans to retrieve some qualitative data.

### Key informant interviews
Connect with and interview groups and people involved in existing feedback mechanisms including the contact center panel, a BVA representative, the Section 508 office, and more.

## Research Questions

- **How accessible (and to a degree, usable) are current feedback methods on VA.gov?**
  - From secondary research, is a11y feedback being received at all?
  - Have prior audits been conducted? When were they conducted? Were they maintained?
  - If not, can we determine how legally compliant and usable existing tools are (to a subjective degree)?
- **Where do disabled Veterans currently provide or expect to provide a11y feedback on VA.gov (if at all)?**
  - What were failed attempts at providing feedback like? (if any)
  - Where do Veterans go first to provide feedback?
  - Is their feedback active or reactive?
- **What kind of a11y feedback do disabled Veterans provide (or want to provide) on VA.gov?**
  - Are there gaps in the issues we’ve identified and the feedback Veterans want to provide?
  - Which issues would make the most impact if they were remediated? 
- **Do some subgroups (or individuals) among disabled Veterans have a greater need (if at all) for providing and resolving accessibility feedback more than others?**
- **How is a11y feedback for VA.gov currently processed?**
  - Are there any existing processes in place? Are they mapped out?
  - How does a11y feedback travel from different parts of the organization?
  - How do we respond back to Veterans?
- **What mental models do disabled Veterans have of the a11y feedback process on VA.gov?**
  - Do their mental models cohesively align with the actual process? 
  - Are there any unintended mismatches?
