# Initiative Stand Up

Meeting objective: create awareness around the progress of our initiatives across VSP, celebrate wins, see where cross-team collaboration is needed, and unblock blockers.

---

## How it works

This is a 30 min meeting, in which we go through each initiative from the NOW section of [the VSP roadmap](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t7LEsiyq2NCJeqKTgoixHJ9MPEIsQMK3NHbIaEQoHr8/edit#gid=38328890), starting with the initiatives under Objective 1, and moving on to Objective 2, 3, 4, 5 in order. A series of quick questions will be asked about each initiative, and the PM for the team that owns that initiative is responsible for providing answers. It should take < 1 min per initiative, unless there are blockers to discuss.

1) What phase is this work in? (Define, Discover, Build, or Validate)
2) How will you know you're "done" with this iteration of the work?
3) What dependencies are impacting your progress?
4) When are you planning to start your rollout?

## How do you know what phase your work is in?

**Define:** this is the time when you're honing in on the problem are you solving, and what impact you hope to have as a result.

**Discover:** this is when you're exploring options, validating assumptions, and creating a more detailed solution approach.

**Build:** this is when you are getting your solution to a release-ready state, and testing it with users.

**Validate:** this is when your initial rollout steps have begun and you're learning what's working/not working about your solution, and how it's doing with regard to the impact you hoped it would have
