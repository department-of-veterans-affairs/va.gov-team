# VSP DEPO points of contact

This is an evolving list of the appropriate VSP DEPO point of contact across various VSP initiatives and teams.

PMs, please make sure you have at least a bi-weekly meeting set up with the indicated DEPO VSP Lead, and make sure they’re looped into strategic meetings about the indicated initiatives and services.

--

**Note 1:** *This list isn’t comprehensive! For things that aren’t listed below, or for things that feel like a gray area, please @ mention one of us when you need air cover, decision-making, strategy, or awareness and we’ll tackle on a case by case basis.*

**Note 2:** *If a different person emerges as a better point of contact as these things evolve over time, then we will adjust. This doc is meant to simply be an easy reference for people, not a mandate set in stone.*

**Note 3:** *It might make sense at some point to consolidate this information into the [List of VSP Services](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fn2lD419WE3sTZJtN2Ensrjqaz0jH3WvLaBtn812Wjo/edit#gid=0).*

## Escalation Path

**When you need a DEPO decision to be made**
@ mention the appropriate point of contact in the thread where the decision is needed. If it’s time-sensitive and you don’t get a response within 30 minutes, or if it’s outside that person’s normal working hours, @ mention `depo-vsp-leads` which is a Slack group comprised of Dror, Kevin, and Rachael, and whichever one of us is available will step in.

In rare emergencies when none of us are responding in Slack, find our phone numbers in our Slack profiles and text and/or call us.

**If you see unhappy-path behaviors or patterns as you work with VFS teams**

Discuss with the appropriate point of contact to figure out how to change those patterns. Perhaps it will warrant some DEPO- or VFS-facing messaging, or perhaps a change to a process or template.
