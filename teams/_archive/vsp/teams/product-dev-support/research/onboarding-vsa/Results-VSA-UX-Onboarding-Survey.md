# Results: VSA UX Onboarding Survey

### Do you know what to do next?
2/2 participants answered "Yes."

### What information do you need to move forward?
* I need to know calendars so I can appropriately schedule 1:1 with UX Research Design, Content, IA and accessibility. Can't wait! Do you guys use Calendly?
* Need to know what my team lead needs me to do to get started on the work.

### Rate the helpfulness of this kickoff meeting.
2/2 rated it "Extremely helpful."

### The content of the kickoff meeting felt ___.

* Very informational. I like that you're providing these as PDF deliverables here after. I think you guys could do more of overview in presenting instead of compelling oneself to articulate bullet for bullet.
* A little rushed because there was a lot of information in a short amount of time. Also, not everything pertained to me but it was interesting to learn about other areas.

### I felt like all of my questions were addressed.
* 1 - Yes
* 1 - No

### What did we miss?
* The Link to the Sketch Design System. Does it use Abstract for Version Control for designers? Do we use Invision for Developer Deliverables to use Inspect for code snippets?
* In-Person Moderated Sessions in San Diego. We have a large Veteran Population here, and it seems silly to isolate to DC only. How can I go about this process?

### Whatâ€™s your level of confidence for finding answers to questions on your own?
2/2 participants answered "Somewhat confident."
