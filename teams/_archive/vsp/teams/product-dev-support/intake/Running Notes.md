### How does it work today?

**Intake**

- Monthly funders/stakeholders meeting to learn about upcoming priorities
- Recommend follow-up research w/Marcy to sort out how these things come in
- Political black box probably
- New laws, new policies often throw wrenches in existing plans
- Have started DSVA issue template enables DSVA to gather more info about projects to determine if they'r a good fit for VSP
  - Sometimes send this back to folks when their requests come out of "nowhere" to get more info
  - Someone at VA wants USDS to build a thing
  - Now being uses as someone at VA wants something on VA.gov or wants something changed, and this is for DSVA to figure out how to make it happen
  - Saying "no" is not realistic, so more "how to get to yes" in a way that benefits Veterans
  - Next 3-6 months mostly Leah, David, Marcy, DEPO coordination.
  - If need + money + team exist, hard for VSP to say "no".
  - DSVA has priority, and goes out to find money + teams available to do it, then bring them to VSP
- Some teams want to get on VA.gov, and end up finding VSP by referral
- Scenario of teams having something in different tech stack and wanting to get on VA.gov has not happened yet, but it is a thought for the future

**Onboarding**

- Make sure they have a product owner
- First contact happens w/Product Owner, Matt Self has pointed team leads to Ryan Luu to finish getting access
- Recently w/BAH, Matt Self had the new team post in Platform Support channel when they were ready to start
- Most recently w/Insignia, Patrick Bateman had a couple of meetings w/them. One with Chris J did a handoff to talk about scope, then a second one w/Leah + Patrick to discuss capabilities and experience working in stacks likt his and in modern product development to get a sense of do they have a good chance here. Probability evaluated, then handed off to Jeff and Andrea who'll be running the stream of work. They've been trying to figure out kickoff dates from there. Insignia is now figuring out how they can fit this work into their existing contract.
- When they're ready, that's when we'll pop back up and give them stuff to start on.
