# Historical GA Properties

Prior to September 2017, Vets.gov used "per product" properties in Google Analytics. As Vets.gov grew, this strategy did not scale and prevented us from easily answering questions about behavior across the whole site.

As of 1 September 2017, all data is reported into the `Vets.gov All` property. From that point forward, the unified property is the definitive answer on data.

Because GA does not transfer data, the old properties were not deleted. Instead, they were left in GA but marked with a `HISTORICAL-` prefix.

Key counts for transactions are documented in the scorecard repo with a cutoff date of 1 September.
