### Maslow's Hierarchy of Insights Needs

Start the MVP focused on the bolded items

1. Data: performance
2. Data: usability data
3. `*` Easy Access
4. `*` Insights
5. Data: outcomes data
6. `*` Adoption
7. Advocacy

## MVP Approach:

Focus on Easy Access, drawing out Insights, and driving Adoption in the MVP -- w/the goal of enabling Product Owners to use the data in their workflow to make product decisions.

Things to update from the existing prototype:

- Test initial MVP in Google Sheets
- (Access) Do design pass so it adheres to design best practices
- (Access) Iterate to ensure 508 Accessibility
- (Insights) What are the thresholds we use for color coding?
- (Insights) Add initial microcopy / glossary / content to explain what these things are
- (Insights) Add Weekly view (since Monthly is probably too long to go w/o knowledge on how something is doing)
- (Insights) pre-populate suggested outcomes data to track that will be blank until known
- Stretch: realtime
- Stretch: populate weekly performance automatically
- Stretch: populate monthly performance automatically
- (Adoption) Do usability research to test for:
  - (Insights) Legend to understand how to turn color indicators into actions
  - (Access) link things up to their source
  - Among a lot of other things captured in Layla's research plan

### Post MVP:
- (Adoption) Set up alerts
- (Insights) Measuring iterative development should require baselines + intentional tracking to see if they improve w/iteration
