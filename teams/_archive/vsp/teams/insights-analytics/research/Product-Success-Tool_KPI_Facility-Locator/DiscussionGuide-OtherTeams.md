## Moderator logistics

*Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.*

*Before the session, send out the [observer instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).*

*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Amy and I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the Product Success Tool for the Facility Locator KPIs. I know this isn’t your team or you’re KPIs. We’re asking to you to look at this, because we are evaluating creating something similar for your team.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the tool to better meet your needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record your screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start screen recording using Zoom.*

## Warm Up Questions - 5-10 minutes
* Before we start, I want to take a few minutes to ask you some questions.
* Can you tell me a little bit about what your role is? 

#### General product health questions
- What decisions would analytics data help you make?
- Once you had the data, what sort of action would you take?
- How often would you ideally look at analytics data? Monthly? Weekly? Daily?
- How do you collect data for you KPIs currently? What does that process look like?

## First task: React to Product Success Tool - Facility Locator KPI tracking
Okay, I am going to send you a link to look at the tool in Domo. Can you open that link and share your screen so I can see what you see?

Take a moment to scan this page, and walk me through this page and what you're looking at. 
Would a tool like this be useful to you for collecting KPI metrics? 
How would a tool like this help you to report metrics?

* Are there any metrics or wording that is unclear?
* Are there anything that’s missing or anything that you would want added?

* Do you have any questions?


## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the dashboard and make sure it really works for users.
