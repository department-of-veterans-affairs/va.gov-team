## Notes:

- Tell me about your role
    - "Product lead for VSA. One of the programs building veteran facing applications on VA.gov"
- Do teams report KPIs to you
    - "Yes
- What does that usually look like
    - "It starts with a product outline...There they begin to think about what success looks like as it relates to that particular initiative"
    - Once work begins in earnest "I add it to a manual tracker that I use"
        - Adds KRs with before & after values
- How often do you look at the data for that?
    - "Twice a week"
    - "It's tricky because gathering those baselines has been an issue for a lot of product teams"
        - "Maybe because the data is hard to retrieve, or they haven't done it before"
        - Or it's the first time tracking digital data, and prior process was a legacy paper proces
- How do you use that information?
    - "Used to evaluate the success of that initiative" after it launches..."That's the ideal"
    - Haven't had many complete feedback loops for initiatives yet.
    - "Hopefully we can do a bit better job analyzing the feedback loop there"
- How do you know something is successful?
    - "Our main indicator is improved KPI movement...that's how we indicate success"
- What is successful? The team? The product?
    - "I'd say to be honest, if I had to pick one, the initiative would be successful or not"
    - "Sometimes we have feature teams that are handed an initiative rather than a product team that has a portfolio that they maintain for a longer period of time"
- Opening up Domo and sharing screen...
- Talk me through what you're seeing and how you interpret it? From your perspective.
    - "I'm extremely glad that there is an anchor around the product that we're actually talking about" (the headers"
        - "Not some jargony term that's very esoteric"
    - "Same with the KPIs at the top" (very clear at a glance)
    - "Interesting that we're linking to the actual work that may or may not impact that KPI directly"
        - "We can't just do the objectives, we need to do that traceability"
    - "It's tough to know if this chart (KPI #2) relates to this KPI (KPI#1)" Confusion around the labels not being 100% in alignment
    - "I'm interested in how much UI tweaking Domo lets you do...horizontal rules & such"
    - "This is great, I really like KPI 3 because it grounds me in what the objective was, the scale is appropriate...It tells me that there is some sort of floor on what has transpired"
        - "Would be cool if I can change the timeframe" Struggling to find how do to that
        - Specifically wants to zoom out: "I want to rule out that this is a seasonality trend"
- How much data would you want to zoom out to see?
    - "This is a year already as it is. Ideally we'd see maybe two years worth of data to confirm seasonality. I wouldn't think going beyond 2 years would be super helpful."
- Looking at KPI 4 Limitations & Data Updates
    - "Super helpful" to understand where it comes from and how to interpret it even though it's followed up with a chart
- KPI 3 & 4 graphs...
    - "If somehow satisfaction is correlated with the type of refinement that a user is doing
- Objective 2
    - Wants a synopsis of what this objective means and why it would be helpful
    - "It'd be cool to see the new state of the world after this objective is achieved"
- O2 KPI 1
    - "I'm not sure what parity is"
- O2 KPI 2
    - "This is cool, telling me when certain things hit Prod so that we can line it up with what's actually happening [in the chart]"
    - eg. New Relic feature, once something goes to Prod it adds a vertical line to the chart so that you can see the potential discontinuity
- Would that mean refining to change your KPIs to better match what data is available?
    - "I feel like it's a chicken or the egg"
    - "Should we be strict about what success looks like vs rely on what's available...I'd rather be strict about it"
    - "I think I would opt for not necessarily adjusting the KPIs we care about because the KPIs we care about we know are really indicative of success. Can we track it, that's a second question"
- O2 KPI 3
- Objective 3
    - Notes absence of data
- "I think [limitations/data updates] is really important because someone has noticed that this is a missing link and really called it out"
- Is this something you'd like to see more of?
    - "yes, absolutely"
    - "GA very often gets flooded with too many metrics" that cloud the data. In contrast to here.
- Would you be able to tell whether this product is successful or not using this dashboard?
    - "Yes, (search refinements and CSAT) are the quintessential metric for that"
- Would you use this dash to help teams and PMs to refine KPIs?
    - "Yes, I think the seasonality question may come into play, and there may be mitigating factors on what we see in the KPI"
- Would you want to share this with anyone and how would you do that?
    - "Absolutely. I would love to share this out"
    - "The manual tracker, I was going to just publish that with DEPO leadership and team leads. Right now it's an open tracker out in the world"
        - "The idea for that was just to put it out in the universe and start a conversation that way. But that can get messy very fast where this (Domo) is cleaner"
    - Lack of export seems "glaringly missing"
- Would you want to give other people access it Domo, or share it as a flat file?
    - "Um, as we were talking through the limitations, I was thinkitng I could take screenshots and use it wherever I wanted to, such as in a feedback deck..."
    - "I wouldn't mind. No, not at all. Especially with how contextual these KPIs are"
    - "I feel very comfortable sharing this out as a deep link"
- Is there anything you'd want to add to it that's not already here?
    - re: traceability — "each team has a northstar for their products...including that in there would be helpful" (beneath the page header)
    - "If we could use consistent language like 'bets' or 'initiatives' beneath the KPI that would be useful to reinforce how we are thinking about these things"
- Do you have any other questions?
    - "What scope or scale is the dashboard limited to? A given product? A portfolio of products? Objectives change over time. Would that mean there should be a static KPI dashboard separate from an OKR dashboard?"
        - "What happens if a given KR...is achieved and then it would make it not as important to focus on"
- Would you want to see both a dash for team success and another for metrics?
    - "As long as we're consistent in saying that when we look at this dashboard it's the health of a given product in perpetuity, rather than being scoped to a given quarter as this objective (1) leads you to believe...." tails off
- Would you use these dashboards for the VSA scorecard?
    - "I mean my goal, and I hope we're referring to the same scorecard meaning the product tracker, (yes), if I could retire that, that would be fantastic"
        - "I wouldn't want it to be duplicated because we are manually entering data points into there"
