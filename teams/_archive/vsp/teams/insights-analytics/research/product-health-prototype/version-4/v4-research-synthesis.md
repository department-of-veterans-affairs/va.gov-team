# Results Summary
A "next step" from the Google Sheets MVP, we created a prototype with the Education products on the BI Tool, Domo. We wanted to test the prototype with product owners and stakeholders to identify gaps, areas that need improvement, and viability of this data cut.

## Research Questions
1. Did the Product Success Tool in Domo help you evaluate the success of VA education products?
1. What is your role?
1. Does the dashboard with historical trends in Domo give you different insights than the Google Sheets MVP?
1. With access to the Product Success Tool in Domo, would you still want or need to use the Google Sheets MVP?
1. Which of the charts are useful or not useful?
1. What would you improve?
1. What interval of time would be most helpful to have data for?
1. How would you use this data?
1. If youâ€™re sharing this data, who would you share it with?

## Hypothesis
Product owners and stakeholders are able to understand the health status of their products. They are able to drill down to find deeper insights so that they can address issues.

## Method
Shared on DSVA Slack with a corresponding survey. Shared in an Education team meeting and sent corresponding survey.

## Insights & Recommendations

### Usefulness
* Users found the dashboard moderately helpful
* Liked the narrowed scope of available data (to understand what to actually look at)

#### Which data was most helpful
* Successful submissions
* CSAT

#### Which data was not helpful
* Call Center (this may be due to the lack of data on the chart)

#### Who is it shared to
* VA Product Stakeholders (i.e. VBA)
* Team members

#### Data Time Frame
* Almost split between monthly & weekly

### User Challenges
* Not understanding how to use the data to follow up
* Labeling from GA isn't readable

### Difference from Google Sheets MVP
* Moderately to definitely different from the information on the Google Sheets MVP

## Overall Insights Recommendation & Follow Up: 
**Design**:
- Show weekly & annotate monthly
- *Should be on all dashboards moving forward* We need to further humanize data labels, particularly Google Analytics. It allows for more readability and doing a 1 for 1 on GA labeling causes users to believe they should just go directly to the source for data.

**Usefulness & Moving Forward**:
Results of the survey were generally positive and indicated that the Domo version of the original Product Health Tool was helpful and provided differing information than the Google Sheets MVP. The Insights team should continue research on the Facility Locator KPI Dashboard to compare results and compare with quantitive data (are folks actually using it).
