# Form Patterns Library 

## Overview
The Design System Team mission statement is to provide simple, scalable, high quality tools and guidelines that enable teams to rapidly build and improve the Veteran facing digital applications provided by VA. One of the tools is the form patterns library which is used by VFS team to use to design, test and build a form for an application. 

## Problem Statement
We believe that VFS teams are not designing and building forms efficiently because there isn't a "source of truth" which results in wasted time spent on designing and building a form that already exists.  


## Personas
VFS teams 

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Number of form patterns used by VFS teams vs Number of newly built forms 
- Number of customer support requests related to the form patterns library 


#### Baseline KPI Values
- Number of form patterns in use
- Number of customer support requests related to form patterns usage

---

## Assumptions
- Developers and designers are not finding and using established forms because there is either no or scant documentation.
- VFS Teams are building new applications with forms that are in the forms library.

## Solution Approach

- Identify which form patterns are missing documentation or have inadequate documentation
- Add documentation to the form patterns
- Simplify forms library usability
