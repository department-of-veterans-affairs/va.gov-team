Capturing pain points and ideas for us to consider as we figure out where we want to put small nudges or other features in place to improve the e2e VFS Team user journey.

From Chris V:

As I give support, I already sometimes have no idea what team a person is on, what they're working on, and what their ultimate goals are. This makes supporting them kind of fuzzy as I figure those things out. When we get more teams on board, it's only going to get more complicated.
I propose we have a few things (some of this might already exist in some capacity, but I have no idea where to find it):

1) Have VSA team members put their team in their Slack profile (only way I can tell what team somebody is on is by their email, but what if we have two BAH teams?)
2) Have a team -> project map -> ultimate goal map
3) Either in this map or somewhere else, have a contract lifespan section that records when a team starts and when a team's contract is up (this would help us figure out if they're vomiting a bunch of code because their contract is running out, for example; we could then respond more appropriately)

This idea came from this request. My knee-jerk reaction was, "Why are they trying to take over the home page? Is that a thing they're supposed to be doing, or did they just decide internally that it was for the best? How can I know?"
I figured it's probably kosher or he wouldn't be asking, but it wasn't until I asked Nick about it and he said that the goal was by the end of their contract in a month, we can retire vagov-content. That cleared the whole thing up for me. That's the ultimate goal.

@Rian Fowler @chris.valarida We'll be migrating the home page to Drupal in the next week or so. I'm building the GraphQL queries, but there looks like there will need to be some additions to /src/site/stages/build/drupal/metalsmith-drupal.js as well. I'm comfortable with making these changes, but am ok handing it off to you all if you would prefer. Any thoughts?
