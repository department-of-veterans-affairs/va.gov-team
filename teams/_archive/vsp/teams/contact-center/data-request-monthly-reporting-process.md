# Monthly Reporting Request Process

This document includes the history, current state, and future goals of how VSP Contact Center POCs interact with and retrieve information from external contact centers.  

This process will be clearly outlined and updated once confirmation is received from each of the contact centers that we are reaching out to.

Currenlty, many contact centers that we work with either do not provide any data at all or the data is provided intermittently.  Reporting has been requested in the past, however, there has been little to no progress.

Information is received from NCC (National Call Center) only after a POC (Chante or Kimberley) reaches out to the appropriate contact to obtain the reporting for that particular month.

The goal is to have all contact centers provide data to us that may be affected by a tool that we help support.  Retrieving reports in either CSVs, Excel, or through an API.

It has been established that the following contact centers will be contacted initially in an attempt to establish a relationship and obtain reporting on a monthly basis.  Depending on the responses, the process may be different for each center, but the goal is to have one streamlined way of receiving information from each contact center.

- NCC: National Call Center

- Education

- NCA: National Cemetery Administration

- HEC: Health Eligibility Center

- HRC: Health Resource Center

- VEO: Veterans Experience Office

- IRIS: Inquiry Routing and Information System

## Process
The process to obtain this information will be to reach out to each of the call center POCs independently and request this information via email.  Depending on the previous relationship that the call center had with VA.gov, this information may not be easy to obtain (if at all). 

The email will include why we are requesting this data, how it will be used, who it will be shared with.  Moving forward, any requests for data from contact centers will have to include this information so that it can accurately be relayed to the appropriate call center.  Reporting will be requested in any format however (CSV or API), the preferred method would be Excel so that it is easy uploaded into DOMO.

If the call center agrees to provide the requested data then we will inquire if there is currently a distribution list that receives the reporting.  If not, a request can be submitted via email on a monthly basis by one of the VA.gov Contact Center POCs.  

For VEO, we can pull data directly from Salesforce. We shall have agreement and understanding on what data we are using and how it will be used.

For IRIS, we have a closer working relationship and partial ownership of this web form contact product/process. For now, we still need to request data from direct owners. 

### DOMO Reporting
Once data is received and formatting verified or updated, we upload to DOMO for reporting; currently on a monthly basis.
