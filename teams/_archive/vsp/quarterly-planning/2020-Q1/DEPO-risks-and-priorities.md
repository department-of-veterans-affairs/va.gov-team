# Q1 2020 Planning: DEPO risks and priorities

**bolded items** = things that could be addressed through VSP team initiatives on the roadmap, but no initiatives exist today

## Risks
- We don't (continue to ) socialize/communicate platform's meaning and impact across DEPO leadership and larger VA stakeholders
- We don't see the forest for the trees: losing sight of how efforts ladder up to larger impacts because of the target rich environment
- We are too nice: being good people who want to help out without thinking in terms of multiplication factors
- We can't agree on good: objective definitions of quality (design, code)
- Ongoing support tasks taking up too much time, and we don't know how much time it takes
- Lots of leadership changes
- Integrating the CMS as a platform offering
- Transition to second period of performance / optional tasks
- Team health survey responses from underrepresented ppl in tech
- VFS Team DEPO Lead role definition / awareness of their role and responsibilities
- Teammate burnout from workload
- Our ability to empower our teammates to push back on VFS teams, w/o burning ppl out, w/o pitting contractor against contractor
- **Growing pains of being an open repo. So that we can defend the “default to open” approach if/when we encounter aversion to this model.**

## Priorities
- Design system continued evolution, documentation, and processes
- Evolution of inclusive engineering culture evolution (similar to design)
- Defining the design vision for the platform - what are we designing in service of? What design principles do we follow? What is the evidence that we are following those design principles?
- Normalizing tools and documentation behaviors for greater VFS team permeability
- Separation of concerns b/w VA.gov, Appeals, and Lighthouse infrastructure and applications
- **Includes a long term ownership / architectural plan for vets-api**
- Successful launch of VAOS and one more health care tool
- Highly used analytics tool
- Role-based users / delegations / identity
