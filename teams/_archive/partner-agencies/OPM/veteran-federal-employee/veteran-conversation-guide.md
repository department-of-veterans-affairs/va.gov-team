## Introduction - 5 minutes

Hi, thanks for agreeing to talk to me today! My name is [NAME] and I work at [COMPANY] on behalf of OPM. I also have some colleagues on the line listening and taking notes.

You might already know why we are here, but I’ll go over it again. We’re currently conducting research on the end-to-end federal employee experience, especially as it relates to your experience as a Veteran seeking and receiving services from your HR and OPM. Our goal during today’s interview is to understand your unique experience as a Veteran, and identify what’s worked well and what could be improved. It is valuable for us to have feedback and perspectives such as yours, in order for us to learn more and make better decisions. I want to learn from your experience, and there are no right or wrong answers. Do you have any questions before we begin?

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
- This entire session should take about an hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We look to you to learn from your personal experience. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- Nothing you tell me will affect your benefits or personnel data. No one on this call is personally involved in your benefits or has any information about them. Additionally, in our role as researchers, we are unable to assist with specific HR or VA-related questions.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. Likewise, if there are any questions you prefer not to answer, for any or no reason, you can just tell me so.
- Are you comfortable if I record audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. You may also turn off your video.
- If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
[Start recording] I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today? [Await participant’s verbal consent]

## Thank You and Closing - 2 minutes
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today! Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to improve the way OPM serves its customers.

Do you have a few colleagues who are also federal employees that might be interested in speaking with us? They don’t have to be Veterans. Do you have 2-3 people that we could reach out to?

Lastly, would you be willing to participate in a future research workshop? We are planning a few interactive workshops with other Veterans who are federal employees to further explore some of the things we talked about today. 

[If Yes]: Thank you! I'll have our team follow-up with you as we schedule the workshop.

Great, thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
