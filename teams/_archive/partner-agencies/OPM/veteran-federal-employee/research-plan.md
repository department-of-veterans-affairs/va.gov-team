# Research Plan for OPM Fed CX, Veteran Federal Employee User Research, 8/4/21
As the OPM Fed CX Design Research Lead I have created this research plan to share with my team.
## Goals	
**_1. What product & team are you doing this research for?_**

This research is for the OPM Federal Employee Customer Experience (CX) Research Project, or OPM Fed CX.

**_2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?_**	

The OPM Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) has been conducting IT systems reviews, audits, market research, product, and customer research to help inform its digital modernization strategy to find ways to better direct human resources and employee management services. As part of this program, OCIO has been conducting research with current federal employees, retirees, family members as well as federal agencies and HR specialists to better understand their customers' unique needs and wants. 

OCIO is now undertaking a focused deep dive into specific Federal Employee and federal agency customer experiences to further refine and develop the OPM digital modernization strategy. OCIO is working with Coforma to conduct specific customer experience (CX) research and discovery, and develop service and product recommendations, with a goal to provide a federated delivery model between OPM and external agency HRs for a more unified customer experience.

We seek to understand wants and needs of Federal Employees as related to OPM services, focusing on current Federal Employees (where approx. ⅓ are Veterans), and federal agencies with a focus on the needs of human resource (HR) specialists. Based on research findings, we will provide recommendations for the end-to-end Veteran and Federal Employee customer journey for OPM and federal agencies.

**_3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?_**

These key questions will guide generative research:
- What are the service touchpoints between Federal Employees (including Veterans), agency HR, and OPM? 
- What is the current service experience from the Federal Employee perspective? How do HR officers & OPM map to this perspective?
- What are the needs, bright spots, pain points, and moments that matter relevant to OPM services? Where are the gaps?
- What is desired in the ideal service experience? What is the vision that OPM stakeholders and agency partners align on and support?
- What are the opportunities where OPM and agency partners can better serve its customers?

_**4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?**_ 

We believe that Federal Employees, including Veterans, mostly interact with their agency’s HR representative for the majority of OPM related services, and only become aware of OPM as a service provider at key moments along their employee journey, e.g., onboarding, or when filing a claim to contest a job level or pay grade.
In understanding the wants and needs of Federal Employees as they relate to OPM services, and providing recommendations for the end-to-end Federal Employee customer journey for OPM and federal agencies, we hope to lay the groundwork for a federated delivery model between OPM and external agency HRs for a more unified customer experience.

## Method	
**_1.	What method of research are you planning?_**

We plan to conduct remote moderated 60 minute 1:1 interviews with participants. Interviews will consist of a guided conversation along predefined topic areas.
Secondary research methods with participants who additionally volunteer their time may include collaborative workshops for information gathering and validation of research findings. 

**_2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?_**

Direct interviews will allow us to understand the experiences, wants, needs, and expectations that Federal Employees and Veterans have while interacting with government services during their federal career, and the experiences of HR staff who support them.
Any optional, follow-on workshops will help us understand the landscape from the Federal Employee perspective, including the actors, roles, systems/tools and the relationships between them as it relates to the service experience. Workshops will also provide an opportunity for end users to validate findings. 

_**3.	Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)***_

We are planning to conduct user interviews through Zoom. For optional, follow-on workshops we plan to use Zoom in combination with Mural.  

_**4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)***_ 	

We will be conducting generative user research.

_**5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)**_

We plan to use Zoom. For any optional, follow-on workshops we plan to use Zoom in combination with Mural. 

## Participants and Recruitment	
**_1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?_** 

Primary criteria: We seek 8-10 current Federal Employees that are Veterans, excluding employees of the VA or OPM. These employees may be brand new to federal service, transfers, or have a long tenure in federal service. Employees must have access to a computer and internet connection for remote interviews. 

Secondary criteria: We seek Veterans with a blend of characteristics across:
- Various agencies and executive departments -- What agency do you currently work for?
- Fully separated Veterans with different ranks during their active duty service, along with 1-2 reservists -- What was your rank? Did you remain in the reserves for a time, or fully separate? 
- Job function -- Which category BEST describes your current job function?
- Different federal employment types (e.g. Competitive service (GS, FWS), Senior Executive Service (SES), excepted service) -- What is your federal employment classification?
- Tenure and date of entry into federal service -- How many years have you served with the federal government (excluding military service)?
- Age, gender, race/ethnicity, disability -- What age group do you belong to? What race/ethnicity do you identify as? What gender do you identify as? Are you an individual with a disability?

_**2.	What is your recruitment strategy?**_

Our recruiting strategy for Veterans is to rely on Perigean. As a fallback, we also have a recruitment screener survey for screening all current Federal Employees through Optimal Workshop at: https://20372ziq.optimalworkshop.com/questions/166xkv21-0-0. 

## When? 	
**_1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research?_**
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 	

We plan to conduct Veteran specific user research from August 23 - September 3, 2021. As a fallback, the latest we may conduct the research is September 7-17, 2021.

**_2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)_** 	

As we are not testing anything, but conducting generative user research, we will be ready to conduct interviews at any time within the two week sprint window.

_**3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.**_

Each session will last approximately 45-60 min. We request a buffer time of 15 min between sessions if possible. 

**_4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**._**

If conducted during the August 23 - September 3, 2021 research sprint, we request the following dates and times:
- Aug 24, Tuesday, 9am-8pm ET
- Aug 25, Wednesday, 9am-8pm ET
- Aug 26, Thursday, 9am-8pm ET
- Aug 31, Tuesday, 9am-8pm ET
- Sept 1, Wednesday, 12pm-8pm ET
- Sept 2, Thursday, 9am-11am ET or 12pm-4pm ET

If conducted during the September 7-17, 2021 sprint, we can provide additional dates and times.

_**5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with?**_
