# Topic Dives

## Purpose/background
The VA CMS and Sitewide program live in a vast system with many moving part. These topic dives are meant to be shorter presentations on a specific topic within that ecosystem, that simplifies onboarding or work in a specific area. If there is a topic you want covered, ask about it! Someone else is probably curious too. Candidates for Topic Dives include: CMS / Drupal engineering topics, environmental information, process workflows, Front-end ecosystem topics / data handling, or intricate UX topics.

## How to sign up to present
Add your preferred date and topic to the Topic Dives list below. This acts as both agenda for upcoming sessions, as well as an archive of previous sessions.

## Requested future topics
Please add any potential future topics you would like covered below:
- Overview of the CMS Dashboard for Vet Center editors (and - if possible - the research for how the cards and tasks were determined)
- How does the help desk work?
- content api / accelerated publishing (when it is available)
- How do CMS teams use Task files?
- Sections: How do they work for subsections? How to they interact with roles? ([Slack convo as basis](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CT4GZBM8F/p1723505580525429))
- Cypress

### 3/5/24 - ECA module / use for Aging content notifications 
   - Daniel Sasser
   - Primarily Drupal: Use of ECA module, how we are configuring it on Public Websites for use to send aging content notifications for Full Width Banners. This was a team-internal primer / demo before the feature shipped. Future topic dive may go into greater detail.

### 10/30/23 - How to make your Content Model Documentation ride with your code.
   - Steve Wirt
   - This is primarily for developers.  Prior to now, Content Model Documents had to be created on prod **AFTER** the code adding a new field/paragraph/content-type/taxon made it to prod.  This is to cover a new process to have it ride with the code.

### 10/23/23 - VA Service Taxonomy
- Dave Pickett
- The [VA Service Taxonomy](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/facilities/va-service-taxonomy) is a confusing part of the Facilities product portfolio. It is simultaneuously the simplest of our products (very little dedicated code, mostly powered by out of the box Drupal functionality, content updates are infrequent, no dedicated front end to maintain, etc.) and the most complex (source of truth for fields on lots of other content types, governance spans all our stakeholders, small changes can have large downstream impacts, etc.). Tune in to learn about how the VA Service Taxonomy works and how it is key to the long-term vision of the Facilities team.

### 6/12/23 - Cerner/KISS
- Ryan Koch
- Cerner: VA health systems are undergoing a years-long transition of their Electronic Health Records systems, moving away from VistA in favor of Cerner. The Public Websites team has been tasked with managing the piece of that puzzle that involves linking an authenticated veteran to the appropriate system based on whether that veteran's health care facility has transitioned or not. KISS (Keep It Simply Static): We have a system in place to generate arbitrary static data files from CMS data. The Cerner/EHR data points making their way from Drupal to the browser is one example of this system being used.
