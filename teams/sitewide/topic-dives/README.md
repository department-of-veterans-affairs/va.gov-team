# Topic Dives

## Purpose/background
The VA CMS and Sitewide program live in a vast system with many moving part. These topic dives are meant to be shorter presentations on a specific topic within that ecosystem, that simplifies onboarding or work in a specific area. If there is a topic you want covered, ask about it! Someone else is probably curious too. Candidates for Topic Dives include: CMS / Drupal engineering topics, environmental information, process workflows, Front-end ecosystem topics / data handling, or intricate UX topics.

## How to sign up to present
Add your preferred date and topic to the Topic Dives list below. This acts as both agenda for upcoming sessions, as well as an archive of previous sessions.

## Requested future topics
Please add any potential future topics you would like covered below:
- Overview of the CMS Dashboard for Vet Center editors (and - if possible - the research for how the cards and tasks were determined)
- How does the help desk work?
- content api / accelerated publishing (when it is available)
- How do CMS teams use Task files?
- Sections: How do they work for subsections? How to they interact with roles?
- Cypress

### 6/12/23 - Cerner/KISS
- Ryan Koch
- Cerner: VA health systems are undergoing a years-long transition of their Electronic Health Records systems, moving away from VistA in favor of Cerner. The Public Websites team has been tasked with managing the piece of that puzzle that involves linking an authenticated veteran to the appropriate system based on whether that veteran's health care facility has transitioned or not. KISS (Keep It Simply Static): We have a system in place to generate arbitrary static data files from CMS data. The Cerner/EHR data points making their way from Drupal to the browser is one example of this system being used.
