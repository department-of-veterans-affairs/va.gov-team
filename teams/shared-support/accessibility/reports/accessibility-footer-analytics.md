# Shared Support: Accessibility footer link data insights
## Interesting data pulled from January 1 - November 17, 2022

- Drafted December 2022

Working with Martha Wilkes and accessibility-ops, Shared Support pulled together the following document. The intention of this document is to provide insight into the usage of the accessibility link in the footer of va.gov. This document pairs with [data pulled from Google Analytics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S-W82L_GraSF5S96tdcYMqdj4eQ1QqXbOY775dstz8c/edit?usp=sharing).

We were provided with the following information about the [508 accessibility page](https://www.section508.va.gov/) itself, where the footer link takes folks who’ve clicked it. 

> This year (January 1, 2022, to November 17, 2022) the Section 508 page had…
> 
> - 56,290 page views
> - 51,230 unique page views
> - 1:17 average time on page
> - 69.28% bounce rate (nearly 70% of users did not interact with anything on this page)
> - 47.09% exit

To flesh the above out, we pulled the following data: 

Between January 1 and November 17, 2022, the **accessibility link in the footer of modernized va.gov pages was clicked 26,005.**

Of those clicks, **18,123 of them were triggered from a mobile device.**

The 508 page received 56,290 page views, this means that **about 46% of all traffic to the 508 accessibility page came through the footer link.**

*** 

Google Analytics data for the event triggered when folks click on the "Analytics" link in the footer. The data on here and in the linked sheet was pulled using a custom report in Google Analytics named "accessibility-ops accessibility footer link report."
