# How disabled Veterans provide accessibility feedback [DRAFT]
`[DISCOVERY]` `[RESEARCH FINDINGS]`

These findings were checked by the following participants:
- Tim Hornik (Chief of Staff BVA)
- Michael, Ian, and Aubrey (Contact Center and Medallia Team)

They have yet to be checked by:
- The Section 508 office (we will bring this up in a future sync)
- VEO (we emailed them and confirmed receipt, but no feedback has been provided yet)
- Brea and Cindy (we have contacted them, and expect possible feedback before the end of July)

## Goals
Our goal is to establish a process to collect a11y feedback from the public. In order to accomplish this goal, we need to…
- what is known about if and how Veterans provide feedback through existing feedback mechanisms
- start to gain preliminary insight or determine next steps on how to gain insights into disabled Veteran's behaviors, feelings, perspectives, and expectations on providing a11y feedback

## Key insights

### A note on this research's limitations ⚠
As we can only append to existing studies or rely on secondary research and key informants, we are limited in who and how we sample. In other words, any insights from this research cannot be established as broader, representative patterns. They can only be interpreted as localized events. For example, if we hear that several Veterans are using the Medallia feedback button, we cannot assume that it is representative of all disabled Veterans, but we can conclude that some Veterans are using it and fund more time into investigating it further.

Furthermore, this research critically _does not_ include caretakers and family members of disabled Veterans (who may have disabilities themselves). As we note in our next steps, we strongly recommend including them in future iterations of this research.

> [Read more on risk, assumptions, and constraints of this study here.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/shared-support/accessibility/research/2022-feedback/a11y-feedback-research-findings.md#constraints-assumptions-and-risks) We further break down risk for each method used in the full details below.

### Inaccessibility of online digital feedback mechanisms may be preventing some disabled Veterans from using them  
- 100% (5/5) of the digital methods of providing feedback to VA.gov that we audited had major accessibility issues <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/shared-support/accessibility/research/2022-feedback/a11y-feedback-research-findings.md#key-insights--2)</sup>
- Notably, both of the screen magnification users Cindy Merrill ran usability testing with were unable to find the feedback button at the bottom right corner of the page. <sup>[[2]](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/shared-support/accessibility/research/2022-feedback/a11y-feedback-research-findings.md#key-insights--3)</sup>
- Out of 4000+ responses from Medallia feedback surveys procured through over 50+ keywords , only 10 responses pertained to accessibility. However, they were too broad and inspecific to take action on. As noted in our goal, absence of accessibility feedback could indicate a barrier to contributing feedback, which aligns with the inaccessibility of those tools.<sup>[[3]](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/shared-support/accessibility/research/2022-feedback/a11y-feedback-research-findings.md#key-insights-)</sup>

### Some disabled Veterans using assistive technologies may prefer analog or service based methods to get support or provide feedback
- Some would default to either calling the VA, going to a physical location, or finding support through the Blinded Veterans Association.<sup>[[4]](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/shared-support/accessibility/research/2022-feedback/a11y-feedback-research-findings.md#key-insights--3)</sup>
- Others noted they prefered analog methods, and felt excluded by tech-centered approaches. <sup>[[5]](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/shared-support/accessibility/research/2022-feedback/a11y-feedback-research-findings.md#section-508-office)</sup>
- Feedback may also be directed through caregivers and social care workers on behalf of disabled Veterans. <sup>[[6]](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/shared-support/accessibility/research/2022-feedback/a11y-feedback-research-findings.md#tim-hornik-blinded-veterans-association-chief-of-staff)</sup>

### A mental model mismatch may exist between how Veterans _think_ submitting accessibility feedback will work vs. how it is actually processed by the Section 508 office, which may discourage feedback from them in the long term

> "That's another thing. When you call the VA on a11y issues. Nobody picks up the phone. What is it, section 508? You go to call them, leave a message, nobody gets back to you. Sorry I'm throwing them under the bus. I've made certain recommendations on certain things... you can talk to anyone at the BVA... there's... we know there's been issues for years with this website. Even USA jobs... to try and get a JOB at the VA... it is not accessible for the blind user." - Disabled Veteran

In the above quote, the participant did not hear anything back from the VA Section 508 office about their feedback for a Veterans Affairs job posting on USA Jobs. They may not have known that the Veterans Affairs Section 508 office is only able to audit and inform other agencies of reported issues. 

A pain point here is that when they forward tickets to other agencies (like USA jobs), there’s no guarantee that team will provide a response back confirming a fix. <sup>[[7]](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/shared-support/accessibility/research/2022-feedback/a11y-feedback-research-findings.md#section-508-office)</sup>

> "Even if they do, it’s often too late for the Veteran who may have to sit on an unresolved issue for 6+ weeks." - Section 508 office employee

In our monthly call with the Section 508 office, they acknowledged this, and noted 
> "Biggest complaint from peers is when they do complain they don’t ever hear anything. So someone needs to respond with details so they know they’re heard. Veterans feel like they complained but I never heard anything. So why should I mess with it."

## Actionable recommendations

### Conduct more open-ended qualitative research with disabled Veterans who use assistive technologies and their caregivers / family members.
There isn't enough available research now on how disabled Veterans using assistive technologies are (or are not) getting access to their benefits using VA.gov.
- Tim hypothesizes that many more Veterans may be sitting with inaccessible products without providing the feedback needed to improve them. During member checking of our analysis, Tim added "caregivers are facing barriers accessing VA digital tools often due to complexities or information not designed for their populations." <sup>[[8]](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/shared-support/accessibility/research/2022-feedback/a11y-feedback-research-findings.md#tim-hornik-blinded-veterans-association-chief-of-staff)</sup>
- VEO (Veterans Experience Office) may not have considered disabled Veterans who use assistive technologies in their research and generated artifacts. In our conversation with a VEO employee, we learned that although survey templates are being developed and tested for 508 compliance-- they are uncertain if any projects have specifically addressed accessibility or disabled Veterans yet. <sup>[[9]](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/shared-support/accessibility/research/2022-feedback/a11y-feedback-research-findings.md#djilan-yao-veo)</sup>
- VA.gov mostly conducts closed usability testing, which can point out local issues, but often can't address larger systemic issues beyond the lens of any particular product.

An immediate opportunity may exist to collaborate with VEO to conduct more open ended qualitative research and output artifacts that more clearly identify disabled Veteran's top  accessibility issues and concerns. Ideally these could better inform future priorities and actions taken by our accessibility practice and the Section 508 office. 

### Prioritize the resolution of open, unresolved accessibility issues.
- The contact center team has been fantastic, and is already working to address identified issues from this study.
- We created the modernized VA.gov accessibility statement to address accessibility issues on the Section 508 page where the Section 508 email was originally housed.
- For teams with blockers related to underlying technology, we recommend submitting bug tickets directly to those vendors (e.g. Microsoft, Medallia).
- We also might suggest conducting regular maintenance audits and/or exploring the use of the [accessibility dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lgzMiZZ-0rBPDuB2gRupBAjsyF0WTe005VvEHYrMxww/edit?usp=sharing) to keep track of issues.

### Teams working on feedback mechanisms should prioritize including disabled Veterans using assistive technologies in their research.

Given recent improvements through research ops, the inclusive research practice, and Perigean-- we are better equipped than ever to included disabled Veterans using assistive technologies into our studies. 

The following teams working on feedback mechanisms may be particularly interested in prioritizing this research to take an accessibility-first approach to their design work and reduce accessibility issues downstream experienced by the Veteran.

#### Contact center team
- The contact center team has not yet been able to include disabled Veterans using assistive technology in their research. <sup>[[10]](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/shared-support/accessibility/research/2022-feedback/a11y-feedback-research-findings.md#contact-center-panel-interview)</sup>
- This was due to Perigean wanting more specific guidance on what "assistive technology" meant. <sup>[[11]](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/shared-support/accessibility/research/2022-feedback/a11y-feedback-research-findings.md#mike-manalo-contact-center-researcher-interview)</sup>
- Since then, the research ops team has made substantial improvements to how we recruit assistive tech users. The contact center team will now have access to support from the CAIA (content, accessibility, IA) team too.
- Research may unveil alternative methods for improving Medallia feedback for disabled Veterans. <sup>[[12]](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/shared-support/accessibility/research/2022-feedback/a11y-feedback-research-findings.md#tim-hornik-blinded-veterans-association-chief-of-staff)</sup>

#### Sitewide content team and accessibility practice
- Based on feedback from the Section 508 office and Tim Hornik from BVA, the VA.gov team launched a new Veteran-centered accessibility page to replace the Section 508 feedback page in the footer.
- The launch did not include research with disabled Veterans beyond the Section 508 office team and Tim Hornik.
- For a lengthier content page like this, it may be valuable to conduct iterative [content usability testing like a highlighter test (or equivalent)](https://dscout.com/people-nerds/content-testing) to better understand what is helpful or confusing to disabled Veterans.
- Research on this page should include triangulated perspectives between disabled Veterans, their caregivers, VSOs (like BVA), and the Section 508 office in order to write clear content that bridges across various mental models.

#### Ask VA team
- The new Ask VA team should look to collaborate with disabled Veterans groups as early and often as possible.
- For example, connecting with Tim Hornik (Blinded Veterans Association's Chief of Staff) or Chris Walker from the 508 office could be a valuable starting point.
- As this discovery research focused on a small subset of assistive technology users, we recommend anticipating and exploring more disabled communities who may use this feature. For example, consulting VSO groups and medical staff with experience asking questions related to MST (military sexual trauma) and PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder). 

   
## OCTO Objectives

### This research will directly support all of the OCTO north stars:

- Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
- Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

### As well as the following 2023 objectives:

#### 1. Increase the accessibility, reliability, and security of Veteran's digital services
Establishing an effective (and accessible) process to collect accessibility feedback from the public would create a more connected line of communication between our Veterans, caregivers, and family members and VFS teams. VFS teams would be able to prioritize accessibility work beyond the bounds of launch and maintenance through more reactive, public responsive efforts. 

In the same way teams use and rely on feedback through VSignal surveys, we vision similar outcomes through:
- Improving the accessibility and usability of existing feedback channels (All of the methods of providing feedback to VA.gov that we audited have confirmed major accessibility issues which may prevent disabled people from submitting accessibility feedback.)
- Envisioning new feedback methods centered and designed around the _disabled_ Veteran experience

#### 2. Reduce the time it takes for Veterans to find, use, and receive Veteran services
Disabled Veterans using assitive technologies may not be able to use Section 508 compliant products if they are not easy to use. We hypothesize due to the historical absence of usability testing with disabled Veterans using assistive technologies, a significant percentage of them may not be able to access their benefits without a steep time cost due to:
- having to rely on accommodations or VSOs to complete their applications
- failing to log in to access their personal information and pre-filled form features
- and more

Establishing accessible and usable methods for disabled Veterans to provide accessibility feedback to the VA may help address or uncover key issues and ultimately, upon fixing them, significantly reduce the time it takes for disabled Veterans to find, use, and receive Veteran services.

### This research also supports the [VA.gov a11y vision statement](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/modernized-va-gov-accessibility-strategy)

> Every disabled Veteran and caregiver has guaranteed access to equitable, easy to use, self-service tools without needing to request accommodations.

## Focus areas
- How accessible (and to a degree usable) are current feedback methods on VA.gov? 
- Where do disabled Veterans currently provide or expect to be able to provide a11y feedback on VA.gov (if at all)?
- What are all the current existing mechanisms (accessible or not)?
- What kind of a11y feedback do disabled Veterans provide (or want to provide) on VA.gov? 
- Do some subgroups (or individuals) among disabled Veterans have a greater need (if at all) for providing and resolving accessibility feedback more than others?
- How is a11y feedback for VA.gov currently processed?
- What mental models do disabled Veterans have of the a11y feedback process on VA.gov?

## Constraints, Assumptions, and Risks
This is bootstrapped research with little to no formal funding (yet), we currently cannot conduct an independent qualitative study. We can however add on or append to existing studies with disabled Veterans, interview key informants (who aren’t Veterans from the public), and investigate existing processes.
As we can only append to existing studies or rely on secondary research and key informants, we are limited in who and how we sample. In other words, any insights from this research cannot be established as broader, representative patterns. They can only be interpreted as localized events. For example, if we hear that several Veterans are using the Medallia feedback button, we cannot assume that it is representative of all disabled Veterans, but we can conclude that some Veterans are using it and fund more time into investigating it further.

### Assumptions
- Disabled Veterans have an interest in providing feedback in the first place (we’ll look to prove/disprove this) 
- Disabled Veterans are actively accessing and using VA.gov 

#### Disabled Veterans are a big tent, so we’ll need to be strategic with sampling
- When we refer to “disabled” in disabled Veteran, we are referring to any Veteran that either identifies with or has been diagnosed with a disability. This may range from Veterans with minor temporary disabilities like migraines, to Veterans with acquired permanent disabilities like TBI or blindness, and Veterans with congenital (from birth) disabilities.
- As a starting point, we may be interested in determining through secondary research (e.g., SME interview with Tim Hornik from the Blinded Veterans Association) if there are any particular subgroups (if at all) that are more likely to provide or need a response from accessibility feedback.
- We’ll want to pay close attention to patterns and differences between different types of disabilities while also acknowledging that no one disabled person is alike.

### Key insights 🧭
- The majority of the data we parsed through was noise, with little key signals that could answer or relate to our research questions
- Out of 4000+ lines of potential keyword matches, we were only able to extract ~10-20 lines of potentially relevant feedback, but they were either too broad, were inspecific, or lacked context to extract any confidence from
- This could be a symptom of the inaccessibility or discoverability of the feedback button and feedback survey for disabled Veterans, and may be a topic for future research

## [Page Analytics](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/shared-support/accessibility/reports/accessibility-footer-analytics.md)

Eli Mellen conducted research into the page analytics of the “Accessibility” link in the footer.

### Key insights 🧭
- Between January 1 and November 17, 2022, the accessibility link in the footer of modernized va.gov pages was clicked 26,005.
- Of those clicks, 18,123 of them were triggered from a mobile device.
- The 508 page received 56,290 page views, this means that about 46% of all traffic to the 508 accessibility page came through the footer link.

### Unknowns, risks, and limitations 🤔
- This data was analyzed at a very preliminary level; there is an opportunity to do a deeper analysis with a more longitudinal set of data.

### Outstanding tasks and questions ⁉️
- A goal of follow up data analysis could be to develop a user journey map that converges on providing feedback.
- This data analysis revealed that a high percentage of folks who clicked on the accessibility link were using mobile devices, this suggests there is an opportunity to do more focused studies on the va.gov experience from mobile devices.
- We have determined that there is traffic from the footer to the 508 page – a follow up analysis should be done to determine why folks are going to the 508 page and if they are able to find what they are looking for there.   

## [Accessibility Audits](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sQ0qNE9Ne_cU1kjnyw29whXLiqAJI9b9VydHlPqWiWg/edit?usp=sharing)
As an extension of secondary research, we plan on also conducting an accessibility audit depending on the existence and quality of prior accessibility audits for the following tools:

### What our audits covered
- VA.gov Feedback Button 
  - Some major issues with magnification devices.
  - Informed ian.mccullough@oddball.io of these defects.
- VA.gov Intercept Survey 
  - Some major issues with magnification devices. Repetitive and verbose on a screen reader.
  - Informed ian.mccullough@oddball.io of these defects.
- Section 508 Page 
  - 5 major accessibility issues. 15 year old page.
  - Created a new accessibility statement to address this. Replaces old link under “accessibility” in the footer. New a11y statement analytics can be tracked on google analytics.
  - Need to inform Section 508 team of a11y issues on the Section 508 page.
- Virtual Agent (chatbot) 
  - Major issues were left unresolved as they could only be fixed by Microsoft.
  - Need to inform chatbot team of issues. 
- Ask.va.gov 
  - Noted as inaccessible in interview with contact center panel. Poor usability on mobile devices.
  - Connected Section 508 office with ask.va.gov team.
  - The latest update is there's nothing the 508 Office can do until April-ish timeframe. That is the earliest opportunity there may be an AskVA dev team funded to make design changes. Chris Walker is aware.

### What our audits did not cover
- My VA 411 (800-698-2411) 
  - Anecdotally accessible. Phone number with TTY. Unsure if wait times, customer support, and more create invisible barriers to callers with disabilities.
- IVR Survey 
  - Anecdotally accessible, but similar to My VA 411, needs additional research. Users can use button presses on their phone to submit responses. Those responses are then captured and input into VSignals Medallia dashboard.
- Facility QR Codes 
  - Some facilities will have QR codes Veterans can scan and provide feedback to. Veterans can submit through these as many times as they like.
- Email 
  - VEO will sample a selected group of Veterans and send them a link to an online survey through email. Unclear if this is similar to the surveys on VA.gov; but we believe they share the same base format. Differences may emerge if they are housed in a modal or exist on their own page.
Known unknowns 
- We know there are other surveys e.g. by paper, in-person, etc. Dan and Evan from VSignals measurement team would know for sure the full scope.

### Key insights 🧭
- All of the methods of providing feedback to VA.gov that we audited have confirmed major accessibility issues which may prevent disabled people from submitting accessibility feedback.
- 2 of the methods we audited have confirmed severe accessibility issues which likely completely blocks access to providing feedback.
- Many of these methods were audited in the past based on Section 508 standards (as opposed to WCAG 2.1 AA) which does not cover responsive, mobile, and cognitive considerations). Maintenance historically has not often been conducted post-audit, even with the introduction of updated standards.

### Unknowns, risks, and limitations 🤔
- Audits were cursory in nature. They will likely not capture all potential accessibility or usability issues for disabled Veterans. We should consider the existence of issues as a sign that further testing and usability testing with disabled Veterans should be strongly considered.
- We still don’t know what the full landscape of collecting feedback from Veterans looks like. Connecting with Dan and Evan from the measurements team should give more insight into this.

### Outstanding tasks and questions ⁉️
- WCAG 2.1+ (not 508) accessibility audits and usability testing with disabled Veterans using a variety of assistive technology should be conducted for methods we still don’t have access to (or are unaware of) including the IVR survey, facility QR codes, email, and more.
- More research is needed to understand the disabled Veteran experience of calling My VA 411 as it is currently the only known usable method for disabled Veterans to provide accessibility feedback beyond the Section 508 email.

## Appended interview questions with Veterans
Although we couldn’t conduct an independent study, we aimed to append questions to existing studies with disabled Veterans. Cindy Merrill and Brea Blackwelder piloted this by asking disabled participants the following questions at the end of their studies (homepage usability study and mobile app screen reader user research):
- If you wanted to share your thoughts on this web page with the VA, how would you do it?
- Have you ever done this before?
- If so, how and when?

### Key insights 🧭
- In Brea's mobile study, out of 6 participants who responded:
  - One participant did not know how to provide feedback, one would look for a "contact us" area, one would attempt to call the VA, and another would self-advocate through the Blinded Veterans Association (BVA)
  - Going to a physical location, like a VAMC, was a common fallback should preferred methods not work for 4 out of the 6 participants 
- Screen magnification users on desktop (2/2 in total) didn’t notice the VA.gov feedback button. This is likely due to screen magnification showing only part of the screen at any given time. As there’s no indication that the feedback exists on the bottom right side of the page, it may be missed by magnification users who scan the page left to right with a limited view. For example, consider the simulated image below.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14154792/233375218-e8291f1e-aabc-4b71-842c-3699ea140c2c.mov


### Unknowns, risks, and limitations 🤔
- Insights are based on a significantly limited convenience sample of data. Given these were appended onto interviews with different facilitators, the manner in which questions were posed were inconsistent. As such, the above insights should be interpreted as a strong call to do more research instead of a factual or permanent representation of all disabled Veterans.
- This research only covered the needs of Veterans with low vision or blindness with zoomtext and screen readers; it does not address the needs of Veterans using other types of assistive technologies

### Outstanding tasks and questions ⁉️
- [x] Inform ian.mccullough@oddball.io of issues to be resolved
- [ ] We recommend conducting generative research to explore the full _service_ experience for blinded Veterans; given the limited scope of this research, there may be larger unanswered priorities beyond the reach of the digital VA.gov experience itself


## Key informant interviews
We conducted several key informant interviews with folks who may have expert knowledge or lived experience with this topic. This was not meant to act as a substitute for actual research with disabled Veterans but as a starting point for finding signals of interest to dig deeper into.

### Contact Center Panel Interview 

**Ask.va.gov** receives a11y tickets from folks communicating on behalf of someone else. It’s likely inaccessible as it doesn’t follow the VA design system and Aubrey’s team’s recommendations were unresolved due to platform limitations with the dynamic 365 portal. It was likely not tested for Section 508 compliance.

**Medallia feedback button and intercept survey** [were tested last year](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/platform/medallia/research/CY21-Q1), but screen reader users did not participate despite Ian making a request to Perigean. This may be easier this year with new partnerships with blinded Veteran organizations.

**The primary call center is My VA 411 (800-698-2411).** There’s also a White House national hotline. When a Veteran calls the number and reaches an operator, they’ve reached tier 1 support. If their issue cannot be resolved, it is escalated to tier 2 which is the contact center team. If it cannot be resolved there, it becomes tier 3 which is often for technical issues like editing the markup of the website.
- We’re not sure how the TTY number is handled nor how accessibility issues are triaged.
- Tier 1 agents can log calls in salesforce, but the interface is difficult to search.
Many issues found within salesforce at a glance appear to be home related accessibility issues (as opposed to digital website issues). 
- jkwon@thesocompany.com noted there’s a possibility a11y feedback may stop at a tier 1 agent as the surface level problem may be addressed over call (reading out a data table) while still leaving the source of the issue unresolved (the data table itself is still inaccessible). Jae also asked…
  - How far (if at all) do disabled Veterans go to solve accessibility issues more permanently?
  - What is VA.gov doing to make it easy for users to submit issues?
  - Do agents try to investigate the reason for the user’s issues or do calls end at the point assistance is rendered complete?
  - Ian thought about what kind of training or processes could help call center agents.

**[Medallia feedback has not yet been tested with disabled Veterans using assistive technology](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/platform/medallia/research).** Previous usability testing focused on (1) the initial feedback button and (2) an updated version of that feedback button which demonstrated significant usability improvements for able-bodied Veterans. Conducting research in the future with assistive tech users may unveil key usability insights related to more complex cases and lead to data-driven inclusive enhancements.

#### Action items
- [ ] Josh to follow back with the contact center team about insights (if any) from the Medallia survey data
- [ ] ian.mccullough@oddball.io to reach out to Kimberly to see how she handles and works with tier 3 escalation. Specifically if she’s encountered any a11y issues which have come through.

#### Completed ✅ 
- [x] ian.mccullough@oddball.io to follow up to see if anyone has conducted accessibility testing for ask.va.gov
- [x] ian.mccullough@oddball.io to share any usability studies conducted with ask.va.gov
- [x] Josh KIM to request shared support a11y team to do a cursory audit of ask.va.gov, the medallia feedback button, and the medallia intercept survey to determine if they meet or don’t meet Section 508 compliance
- [x] Ian to send Josh code and instructions for intercept survey testing
- [x] ian.mccullough@oddball.io to dig into salesforce data to examine for digital accessibility complaints or feedback regarding VA.gov.

#### Blocked ❌
- [ ] Josh KIM to reach out to Laura to connect with Marlee (who trains call center agents) to ask about a11y, training docs, and if call center agents know how to reply to a11y requests.
- [ ] Waiting for response from Laura to set up a call with Marlee

### Mike Manalo (Contact Center Researcher) Interview
**No interviews were conducted with disabled Veterans using assistive technology.** This was due to Perigean wanting more specific guidance on what “assistive technology” meant. In this case, they got older Veterans using iPads (as opposed to technologies explicitly used for a disability like a screen reader or keyboard). 

**The more complex the issue, the more likely Veterans will call.** There were forming patterns of older Veterans being associated with doctor appointments and facilities which could generally be resolved via tier 1 support, but any issue requiring more complex topics like verifying a GI Bill payment often went to tier 2 support. There’s an open question of what is effective communication: SMS? Phone? Etc?

**Unsure if there are any particular groups using or not using 411.** Reviewing Salesforce data of Tier 1 (T1) calls may help understand this use case. The vast majority of T1 issues are related to authentication. The contact center team is working with T1 call centers on monthly cadences to review escalation processes for T1 issues to Tier 2.

### Section 508 Office 
**VA.gov team to draft modernized accessibility statement.** Team acknowledged that the Section 508 page was 15 years old and that a modernized accessibility statement in Veteran-facing plain language would be a welcome improvement in hopes of gathering more feedback through the Section 508 email address. 
- “Shouldn’t be a commercial for OCTO”
- Should provide clear expectations and transparency on how feedback is handled and responded to (if ever)
- Should be accessibility focused, not usability focused (part of setting expectations on what the Section 508 email can handle vs. say the Medallia feedback button)

**Veterans are frustrated they don’t hear back when they provide feedback.** “Biggest complaint from peers is when they do complain they don’t ever hear anything. So someone needs to respond with details so they know they’re heard. Veterans feel like they complained but I never heard anything. So why should I mess with it.”

**Managing who tickets go to and how they’re resolved is a complex process.** When the Section 508 office receives feedback from Veterans through their email, they first determine if it is (or isn’t) an issue they can address. If they can address it, they create a servicenow ticket for their team. If they can’t, they find the appropriate team to forward it to. A pain point here is that when they forward tickets, there’s no guarantee the team it is forwarded to will provide a response back confirming a fix. Even if they do, it’s often too late for the Veteran who may have to sit on an unresolved issue for 6+ weeks.

**Section 508 office is interested in the potential of ask.va.gov, but haven’t been included yet.** The office is looking for a way to reduce the number of feedback ticketing systems and looking into ways to follow up on tickets with Veterans. Ask.va.gov may fill in that gap, but it’s inaccessible and the Section 508 office (to their knowledge) has not been included in auditing it.

**It may be difficult to track data on usage of the Section 508 email.** Currently, there are no analytics, and it may be a manual intensive process.

**Veterans who prefer analog methods feel excluded.** “I don’t use tech. Everything you do pushes guys like me further and further out. My wife is good with tech but she’s not a Veteran. Never seems to get anywhere. I don’t do it.” “What Pat said, someone on the phone. Neither AIRA or BeMyEyes is accessible through a regular phone. For me, logging into VA.gov, not a Veteran, they can’t get to the things Brad needs to get to.”

#### Action Items
- [x] martha.wilkes@va.gov to connect Chris with the ask.va.gov team
- [x] Josh KIM to work with Danielle to kickstart drafting a modernized VA.gov accessibility statement
- [x] Josh KIM and martha.wilkes@va.gov to reach out to laura.fortner-monegan@va.gov to talk about the opportunity to kickstart a VEO project around better understanding the disabled Veteran experience.

#### Outcomes
Based on feedback from the Section 508 office and Tim Hornik from BVA, the [VA.gov team launched a new Veteran-centered accessibility page](https://www.va.gov/accessibility-at-va/) to replace the Section 508 feedback page in the footer.

<img width="1199" alt="The new VA accessibility statement provides more direct access to the Section 508 email" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14154792/233379476-14ceb744-8e27-444a-a011-568213c2cd4d.png">

Further research and maintenance should be conducted to adjust based on Veteran feedback. In a recent conversation with a BVA representative, we heard the following:

> "That's another thing. When you call the VA on a11y issues. Nobody picks up the phone. What is it, section 508? You go to call them, leave a message, nobody gets back to you. Sorry I'm throwing them under the bus. I've made certain recommendations on certain things... you can talk to anyone at the BVA... there's... we know there's been issues for years with this website. Even USA jobs... to try and get a JOB at the VA... it is not accessible for the blind user."

> *audible laughter while reading the disclaimer* "'We're commited to providing access to our websites and digital applications' Yea that's all find and dandy what Section 508 is... but nothing ever gets accomplished. I probably called and sent emails a dozen times. Especially after I was trying to get employment on USA jobs... I have to have someone sighted to insert documentation there."

Future research and work should explore:
- Mismatches between the Veteran's mental model and the Section 508 office. For example, in the above case, the participant did not hear back about feedback related to an issue related to USA Jobs. From our conversation with the Section 508 office, we know that they can audit and inform other agencies of issues, but they aren't equipped to implement those fixes. 
- What might the now, next, later look like to mediate this gulf in expectations, provide plain language transparency, or explore service level solutions?

### Tim Hornik (Blinded Veterans Association Chief of Staff)
**Some disabled Veterans are providing feedback, but Tim hypothesizes many more may be sitting with inaccessible products.** Tim shared an anecdote of a social care worker who sent an email to the Section 508 office about the cerner patient portal. Without that social care worker’s relationship with the disabled Veteran and their intervention, the issue may have never been highlighted.

**VEO historically has not considered the disabled Veteran experience**, despite being critical to collecting feedback. As an advocate, Tim requested VEO to have mechanisms and pathways for feedback both virtually and physically at VA centers in the past. This doesn’t appear to have been implemented.
411 may be too overwhelmed to help. Tim noted that 411 call center employees may not have the time, training, and space to record accessibility feedback and forward it to the appropriate places to be fixed.

**The Section 508 page needs an update and more research.** The page has existed for 15 years and includes content on both internal department information and Veteran facing services. It’s linked to from the footer on all VA.gov pages as “Accessibility” which may be misleading. Tim is worried that it won’t be discoverable as a footer item. He knows that people use it (including VA staffers) because we direct them to go there from this external site. 

**We should explore paths of least resistance for improving Medallia feedback.** Tim noted it may be easier to just include a link that acts as an offramp to another form for accessibility feedback within the Medallia feedback options.
- SSA has a plain language a11y page we can reference. We should find other pages as well to make a case for modernizing VA.gov’s accessibility page (currently Section 508 page).

**In past work with rehab centers, people didn’t deliver feedback.** Tim noted that people would complain about accessibility issues in meetings, but wouldn’t formally report on it.

#### Action Items
- [ ] Josh to reach out to blind rehab service centers to learn more about how they handle and respond to accessibility issues (if at all).
- [ ] Josh to interview more Veterans from BVA
- [ ] Josh to continue conversations with contact center team to explore ways of reducing friction for disabled Veterans to provide accessibility specific feedback based on Tim's ideas

#### Completed ✅ 
- [x] Josh to reach out to Danielle to discuss the Section 508 page, its current experience, its purpose, and strategies to modernize it.
- [x] danielle.thierry@va.gov to place the Section 508 page on the content migration roadmap for prioritization
Josh to explore analytics on interaction with the accessibility link in the footer.

### Djilan Yao (VEO)
**Uncertain if any VEO projects have specifically addressed accessibility or disabled Veterans.** It doesn’t seem to be something the measurement team has investigated yet, but could be an area of interest. Evan and Dan may be the next people to talk to (if possible).

**There are 4 main methods of sending out surveys.** Most (if not all) are powered by Medallia. This includes (1) surveys on VA.gov (feedback button and intercept survey), (2) QR codes in facilities that link to surveys, (3) IVR surveys over phone which are then input into Medallia, and (4) surveys sent out to sampled individuals by email which link to surveys. 

**We know some of those surveys (on VA.gov) have accessibility issues documented in Tiffany’s audit.** But we’re uncertain if those issues exist on other Medallia surveys too. For example, if other surveys aren’t within a modal, they likely won’t share the same major issues related to magnification.

**The base survey template is 508 compliant (WCAG 2.0), but may not cover issues beyond that scope.** Surveys are developed for 508 compliance and tested internally through the 508 office. If a survey taker is using a software or technology outside of the 508 boundaries, we are not able to ensure it will work properly. 

#### Action Items
- [ ] Djilan or Laura (if possible) to forward accessibility issues documented in Tiffany’s audit to Medallia (or whoever can address them).
- [ ] Laura to connect with Erin to discuss a short term research effort on the disabled Veteran experience and how they provide feedback to the VA. 
- [ ] Djilan or Laura (if possible) to send Josh sample surveys sent through email. I’d love to test them to determine what issues are consistent with VA.gov. Ideally, we would be able to test these with Veterans with disabilities, but we likely lack the budget/time to do so. 
- [ ] Josh to introduce Tim Hornik to Laura. I think this connection may help accelerate our efforts.
