# VA Design System Focus Styles: Questions and Assumptions

## Questions

- Do teams use custom components outside of the design system that may require a more custom approach to focus styles?
- With the move to v3 of the USWDS Design System, would our link colors or other prominent colors change on the site in a way that would make us rethink focus style colors?

## Assumptions

- We'll need to use another focus style method other than the double box shadow for:
  - wrapping text links 
  - And some other possible use cases:
    - [Checkbox component](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/checkbox/)
    - [Combo box (focus within selection items)](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/combo-box/)
    - E.g. Search
    - [Radio buttons](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/radio-buttons/)
    - Banners
- We're designing for the whole site, not just the design system components.
  - Header (not in design system)
  - Footer (not in design system)

## Requirements

- We're working from using the [double box shadow](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/issues/654) as a starting point.
-  We'll need to select [colors from the USWDS Design System, V3](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/color/system-tokens/).
- We need to consider the following states in combination with the focus state:
  - Resting
  - Hover
  - Active
  - Disabled
  - On both light and dark backgrounds

## Supporting documentation

- [Use double box-shadow for focus styling #654](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/issues/654)
- A11y maturity plan [DRAFT] Double box-shadow focus styling (in progress, coming soon)
