# What's Needed to Start an Accessibility Audit?

Before starting an accessibility audit with the Shared Support team, it can be helpful for your team to think through some key questions that need answers so the accessibility specialists can best help you.

Those questions include:

## How many screens need to be tested?

**Why do we ask this?** Often accessibility audits encompass many different screens, testing an entire flow of a product. However, an audit doesn't have to be many different screens. It can be one or two screens as well. In fact, we prefer this because it usually speeds up the feedback loop between product teams and accessibility specialists.

## Which parts of the application/product are custom, meaning there may be components used that don't exist in the design system?

**Why do we ask this?** This helps accessibility specialists know where the boundaries are between the design system and the product itself. It can help in determining where to create issues, and which team is responsible for fixing them.

## What conditional content or pages exist?

**Why do we ask this?** It's important to test all the functionality of the product. If conditional content gets triggered by selecting certain choices, it's good to know where those choices are and how the conditional content gets activated. This makes auditing more efficient and ensures that we're evaluating everything a Veteran would encounter.
What errors can occur and how can those be triggered?
Why do we ask this? Errors create an important part of the user experience, and often are critical to get right. Knowing what errors can occur will help accessibility specialists test the product more efficiently and make sure we evaluate everything a Veteran would encounter.

## If this is a logged in experience, what testing accounts are needed?

**Why do we ask this?** This helps accessibility specialists test with the right information so all of the appropriate functionality can be triggered.
Should user accounts be kept in their existing states? How should they be reset, if changed?
Why do we ask this? During the process of testing, it's common to change data in fields to trigger errors and explore functionality. If data needs to be in specific states, it's good to know that ahead of time.

## Where should tickets get filed?

**Why do we ask this?** We want the tickets to go to a place where you can find them easily. Also, it's helpful if it's an epic rather than a repository alone since epics group tickets together easier.
