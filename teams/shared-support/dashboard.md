We have a tiny feature (adding a question to our form) and it has it’s own page. I would love it if someone could run through it with a screenreader, if anyone has a moment, we would be very appreciative. I ran NVDA and it seems to do OK, but I am not experienced in using it. I don’t want to miss something just because I don’t really know how to use the screenreader. | Small    | Tiffany Pender    | Accessibility | 2022-07-19      |                | 7/22/2022      | 1010                                    | Heather Justice                    | Message came in to Eli over Slack.
