Our designer, Nick Osmanski, has been doing initial research and audits of other forms to get ideas. There is page for Dependents that we know is not very accessible and he has been looking into better options. Nick will be presenting to us next week                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |             |                   | Accessibility | 07/06/2022         | 2022-07-13     |                | 1010                                    | Heather Justice; Nicholas Osmanski |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Done        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

We have a tiny feature (adding a question to our form) and it has it’s own page. I would love it if someone could run through it with a screenreader, if anyone has a moment, we would be very appreciative. I ran NVDA and it seems to do OK, but I am not experienced in using it. I don’t want to miss something just because I don’t really know how to use the screenreader. | Small       | Tiffany Pender    | Accessibility | 2022-07-19         |                | 7/22/2022      | 1010                                    | Heather Justice                    | Message came in to Eli over Slack. Feature completed over 6 months ago, but hasn't been ready for deploy until now. Heather wanted to double check accessibility before going live.
