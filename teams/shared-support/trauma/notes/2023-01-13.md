`Small Group` `Shared Learning`

---

- Purpose: Share stories on _intuition_
- Attendees: Private

## Key Summary

### Don’t ignore the uncomfortable 🙈
A practitioner asked about scenarios where a researcher may incorrectly (or be unable to) read the room OR come across circumstances that are hard to anticipate. They brought up an example of where a participant was distracted by “amputation care” being listed as the first item in a dropdown list.
- Rachael validated how this practitioner (a) acknowledged the issue and (b) moved on. 
- She noted, “there’s something nice in not ignoring [the uncomfortable]. It’s so simple and quick, but there’s so much compassion in the act of doing it.

### Marinating our instincts 🤌
A practitioner wasn’t sure if they had good instincts and was worried if they would be able to pick up on cues during a live research session. Another practitioner agreed. They gave an example (outside of a research session) where they struggled to articulate to their team why they preferred minimizing observers (based on intuition and their past experience)... and how they felt anxiety and anger.
- Rachael noted that our fight or flight responses can sometimes blur... and how it can be hard to make a quick comeback or decision in the moment. “It needs marination time”-- as she puts it.
- How might we work through wicked, complex, systems-based issues together? To take time to talk it out? To validate it? To acknowledge it’s happening? 

### Focus on the Veteran... and the best next thing we can do 🦶
Several of us shared stories about clashes of intuition, often where a lack of representation or experience resulted in un-triangulated decision making (often by those with power/privilege). How do we push back, educate, or improve systems bound by leadership that could use more diverse perspectives?
- Rachael, from her past experiences, recommended to focus in on the Veteran. While we can’t completely overturn a system overnight, we can “try to the best of [our] abilities to do something good and turn off all that other noise.” To do the next best thing we can do.
- Rachael suggested exploring ways to impact contracts... and possibly conducting research more with the homeless VA program which she noted had such a diversity of age, gender, race, and more.
- Another practitioner noted the possibility of procuring payment from her team’s own contracts to have more control over the research process.

### Maybe we need an airing of grievances 💢
You bet this group had beef to share. Rachael noted this isn’t a case against positivity, but a way of sharing things we wish we could change (which could springboard into those next best things we can take on together).
