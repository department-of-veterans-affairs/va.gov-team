`Small Group` `Shared Learning`

---

- Purpose: Share stories on _intuition_
- Attendees: Private

## Key Summary

### Did ya know? 🐼 
Giant pandas vocalize how they’re feeling through various sounds. Chirps and honks indicate distress. Squeals indicate pain. Bleats are a friendly gesture. And barks are used to scare off perceived enemies. [For more random science facts, check out the daily atom](https://www.thedailyatom.com/).

Rachael started us off with pandas to ask... what are our thoughts on our intuition in research? Do we have good instincts? Why or why not?

### How do we unlearn? 🤔 
A practitioner shared a little of their journey on learning to unlearn their gut and how they approach research. As they learned more about responsible and justice-based practices, they’ve changed their mind on a number of things and started questioning their senses more.
- So how do we unlearn? How do we keep our intuition in check? 

### Navigating cloudy, coded language ☁️ 
A practitioner shared their experience working with a Veteran in person who they felt was hinting at suicide without explicitly mentioning it. They didn’t want to guess wrong, because it felt like such high stakes.
- Rachael asked if a potential future topic could center around what people do when participants share information that we’re uncomfortable with. 
- What do we do when we feel like it needs to go to another level? What does that look like at our organizations? 
- What resources are available to provide to participants? The VA has support systems in place, while it can be overwhelming, at least it is under the umbrella of one system. 

### Realizing you have to do a difficult, unplanned for thing 😰 
Another practitioner shared their past experiences as a teacher where they would feel a spidey sense that something was wrong, but internally tried to suppress it at times. When they felt a gut feeling that something may turn into a difficult conversation, they would ask... “is my spidey sense way off? Or dead on... and then what? How do I deal with this in the moment?”
- How do we strengthen our response muscle when moments like these occur? 

### How do we build up reps? Standards? 💪 
Rachael shared her experiences managing at the VA-- and how over 1000s of reps it got a bit easier (even though she still hated doing it). She asked the group...
- How do we, as a community, explore the conversation of standards? 
- How can we talk about how we show up when we do the work?
- Can we create scenario-based plans or schematics and document them?

### Matching energies 🪞 
A practitioner shared their experiences doing research work with participants who casually talked about suicide. Their intuition as a researcher at the time was to match people’s energy. They recalled how social workers who worked there advised them that “this is pretty normal, you gotta get used to it.” For the practitioner, it was a moment of realizing that their intuition wasn’t helpful.
- Is “rolling with discomfort” a way to go? If something is uncomfortable to me but not uncomfortable with others, can we roll with that?

### “I don’t know what to say” is ok y’all 🤐
Rachael asked us... have any of you just verbalized “I don’t know what to say” in research? Maybe that’s the starting point. Admitting that we don’t know what to do or doing the next best thing that can be done, especially when we won’t have answers to everything.
- How might we remember our scope of practice and communicate that clearly to our participants... and to ourselves?
- How might we define how we can help, and how we can’t? How might we find the right people or resources to recommend participants when we don’t know how to help?

### Have grace for yourself ❤️
Rachael shared her experiences grappling with past regrets as something that emerges frequently in this work. She shared that moving out of a “why didn’t I do something” mindset and towards a “I did the best that I can in the moment” may be a healthier way to process our various histories in this field.
- How might we treat ourselves with more kindness? How might we reflect on how far we’ve come too?

### Contracting is key y’all 🔑
Rachael asked if there’s any way for us to connect with participants ahead of the interview to talk about the research... but another practitioner kindly reminded us that a contractor still handles most of the recruiting. It may be difficult to build trust with participants when a 3rd party sets up the remote usability sessions and acts as the broker of information.
How might we contribute to contracting language and requirements to nudge towards trauma-responsive outcomes?

### Time to reflect? 💤
Rachael asked if we should use the last 12 minutes for quiet, individual reflection. We all agreed. The day was long, our brains were tired, and the thought of some time to just process it all or rest was amazing.
- How might we build in moments of rest during future small group sessions? How might that be flexible to the participants in the room? To the vibe?
