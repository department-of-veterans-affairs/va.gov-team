`Practice meeting` `Strategy`

---

- Purpose: We followed up on our strategy conversation, but this time as an open circle!
- Facilitator: Martha Wilkes
- [Unabbreviated notes for the full scoop 🍦 ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z5OsfMtlnVp-ntPUi3zPUzw__1mwECqR9bMJygN04h0/edit#heading=h.m75uef8h0ryr)

## Key Summary

### Researchers want a space to share and discuss learnings, debrief on heavier research sessions, and ask for help 🆘
For example, having a space to discuss how we can apply what we've heard in other research sessions or making room for folk to say, "I'm in over my head and I need help."

### We want a space to actively practice skills, preferably with folk with more experience 👟
Folk feel like they need more hands-on experience to be better prepared and responsive. For example, being able to practice through scenarios which provide a foundational framework for response both during and after a session.

### We want to vision and work towards a multi-disciplinary, procurement/staffing driven, trauma-responsive future ✊
That means imagining what it means to go upstream beyond just research (Eli asked what trauma-responsive engineering might look like, Martha and Rachael are getting involved in procurement), having tough conversations about power dynamics (who is more/less safe and empowered?), and taking on a systems mindset.

## Action items 🔥
- [ ] We're going to start piloting possible training sessions this week with Rachael Dietkus in hopes of having scenarios for folk to actively practice and learn from in the future 🙆
- [ ] It may be valuable to draft a vision, mission, and basic maturity model for our growing practice. Lydia suggested referencing the Missouri model for inspiration. I wonder if it would be better to spin up a focused team to work on this so we can reserve our group-wide syncs as spaces to share and learn? If you're interested in helping with this effort, please let me know! 💗
