## Key summary

### Recap: Victor Udoewa was a guest in our last practice circle 🌱

- Victor Udoewa joined our practice circle meeting on April 26.
- Victor practices and advocates for radical participatory design. Liz and Rachael invited Victor to join us. We had an open-ended conversation where we all soaked up as much of his wisdom as we could.

### Being motivated by doing the right thing, not the end goal 🌏

- Christine asked Victor about how you stay hopeful in the behemoth of government bureaucracy and how challenging it is.
> "His answer really struck a chord. Which was basically, I don’t focus on the solution. Like, the solution needs to look like this or be this. He said something along the lines of, I keep showing up because it’s the right thing to do."
- Tyler echoed that this really resonated with her. And Victor talked about how this helps with burnout. If you're motivated by doing the work, you're less likely to burnout. Your motivation is separated from the outcome.
- Martha also shared this quote, from Tracy Ruble's newsletter:
> "Yesterday, on the Livestream that Sidewalk Talk is doing for May’s Mental Health Awareness Month, [El Chen](https://www.youtube.com/live/OuvZVozKIb8?si=zfxliMrOB4aPwNWq&t=243) said, 'We do useless things with people we love.' And that made me happy. Because, in a way, we want listening to be useless. We don’t want to count the number of people who sit and share their stories. We want to be humans with big hearts 'listening' and connecting just because."

### Are we close to doing radical participatory design? 🗯️

- Julie pointed out that what we're doing is far from radical participatory design.
> "For us, we’re so far from that. We do extractive research. We do a good job of really focusing on how we can support Veterans' experiences in those sessions, given the parameters we have. How do we change our script to cede more power back to the participant and to make sure they know where they have choice? And all of the work we do here to explore how we can improve that."
- Rachael highlighted that Victor really shines a light on participatory work that's being done outside the U.S. federal government.
> "[In other contexts] it’s almost effortless, or, unspoken... That that’s how they will actually work. So there's hopeful nods towards the possibility of it."
- Rachael then shared [Sherry Arnstein's Ladder of Citizen Participation](https://www.citizenshandbook.org/arnsteinsladder.html). Sherry called the first two rungs on the ladder: non-participation. And within this, there's manipulation and therapy.
- Prompted by Evelyn's question, Karen shared some of her experiences working with different administrations to do more participatory design. And the constraints that come with it.
- Julie closed by urging us to consider other types of design, besides human-centered (which we do) and radical participatory design (which we're far from), that may be within our grasp.

## Actions, or ideas for future conversations
- [ ] We could talk about other types of design besides human-centered design. What is aspirational, but still attainable?
- [ ] We have plans to talk about a crisis preparedness protocol.
