- We held a discussion on our existing materials

## Key quotes

> This works feels so important like a community of practice… the checklist can’t cover it all… it's learning by doing…

> Any research study that we do feels like it has the potential of going into a difficult topic area… sometimes the Veterans are joining to share trauma imposed on them from the VA itself when applying to benefits

> How do we support one another? How would that impact on what we’re trying to offer [as a practice]
