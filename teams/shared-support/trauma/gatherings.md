# How we gather

Interested in joining us _**synchronously**_? Here's how we gather regularly.

## Community of Practice
This is a monthly meeting, held every 2nd Friday of the month at 2:05pm EST (30 minutes).

The Community of Practice is:
- more structured and formal
- open to everyone/anyone
- facilitated on a voluntary basis
- scribed on a voluntary basis, and notes are made public

## Practice Circle
This is a **new** monthly meeting, held every 4th Friday of the month at 2:05pm EST (55 minutes).

The Practice Circle is:
- smaller
- more fluid and reflective
- to offer peer-to-peer support
- led by a person or a small group of people with experience in trauma-informed design
- not scribed (although, you're welcome to take your own notes)
