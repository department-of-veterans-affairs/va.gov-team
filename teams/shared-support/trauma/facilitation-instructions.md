# Facilitation Instructions
Signed up to facilitate or scribe a small group or event? We got you covered. Thank you for helping us grow our community ✨

## Practice Meetings

### Facilitators
1. [**Read our community guidelines.**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/shared-support/trauma/community-guidelines.md) You'll be responsible for holding people accountable if they break our community guidelines. 
2. **Join 5 minutes early to the meeting.**
3. **Turn on closed captions.** Use Zoom’s live transcription feature.
5. **Start with something light.** Prior facilitators have started with light music, panda facts, and rain sounds.
6. **Review the topics of the week** in the order they were added (or by importance).
7. **Find a facilitator for the next sync.** Everyone should get an opt-in shot at facilitating the practice meeting. If you can’t find someone, you’ll be responsible for running it next time.
8. [**Add yourself to our record of facilitator service.**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/shared-support/trauma) Our meetings are possible thanks to volunteers like you, and we want to publicly thank you for your service! Note: this is 100% optional. 

### Scribes
1. [**Read our community guidelines.**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/shared-support/trauma/community-guidelines.md) You'll serve as passive backup for holding people accountable if they break our community guidelines.
2. [**Read past shared learnings and notes.**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/shared-support/trauma/notes) It may give you a better idea as to what to capture.
3. **Join 5 minutes early to the meeting.** 
4. **Start a slack discussion thread in #trauma-practice.** Ideally we will want to use this, not the built in zoom chat so that our conversation is in a spot others who miss our sync can still reference. 
5. **Take notes of key discussion points.** Focus on collecting key quotes, themes, stories, and action items. You don't have to take verbatim notes, but try to take note of anything that will help you write out a shared learning summary. People who didn't attend the meeting should have an idea as to what happened, key takeaways, and action items.
6. **Write a shared learnings summary based on the meeting.**
  - Add and create a new .md file with the date of the meeting (e.g. 2023/01/11.md) to our [notes folder on github ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/shared-support/trauma/notes). You can copy and paste the [contents of this template as a reference.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/shared-support/trauma/notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md)
  - Email the shared learnings to everyone who is signed up for our practice meetings
  - Post the shared learnings to our #trauma-practice channel
8. **Find a scribe for the next sync.** Everyone should get an opt-in shot at scribing the practice meeting. If you can’t find someone, you’ll be responsible for running it next time.
9. [**Add yourself to our record of scribe service.**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/shared-support/trauma) Our meetings are possible thanks to volunteers like you, and we want to publicly thank you for your service! Note: this is 100% optional.
