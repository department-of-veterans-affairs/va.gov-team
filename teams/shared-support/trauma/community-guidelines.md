# Community Guidelines

## Suggesting changes to these guidelines
Anyone can add meeting norms to this document. If you'd like to add, edit, or remove anything from these guidelines you can...
- Suggest it as a topic for an upcoming [Community of Practice meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z5OsfMtlnVp-ntPUi3zPUzw__1mwECqR9bMJygN04h0/edit?usp=sharing)
- Propose it on Slack at #trauma-practice
- _Coming soon: Suggest it anonymously using a form_

We'll then talk through it as a community to figure out what’s the best way forward together. Important notes here:
- No matter _what_ the suggestion is, it will be seriously and fully listened to and acknowledged. We owe it to our community to respect that we all have different and valued perspectives regardless if they are a majority or minority opinion.
- We're still a growing practice that's 100% volunteer led, so there may also be growing pains in the process. We can be kind to one another and have grace for ourselves as we navigate cloudy weather.

## How we meet
1. **Respect the agenda.** Agendas help reduce anxiety by facilitating meeting preparation. Avoid long discussions on other topics and try not to ask colleagues to speak at length on a topic they might not be prepared to discuss. Instead, offer to put it on the agenda for the next week or to schedule a separate follow-up meeting.
2. **When possible, use a Slack thread or specific google doc space for chat.** In case we have any folk who may not be able to access zoom chat easily or may want the conversation to be accessible in the future, we may want to consider using google docs or a slack thread to do so. (This is Josh fyi, I need to find a better way forward here!)
3. **Your video, your choice.** Video on? Video off? Completely up to you! Do what’s comfortable for you.
4. **No man-splaining!** All of us are capable of condescension. Pay attention to tone of voice and invite others into conversation (rather than claiming to be THE “expert”). 
5. **When appropriate, start with a light moment or fun.** This work can be hard. Starting meetings with something light or fun can help us get in the right mindset to do the work. 
6. **No bad questions.** We’re all here to learn and support each other. None of us are "experts."
7. **Pause and take a breath (or 3) before responding.** If you feel like you need to go on the defensive, give yourself the time and space to respond. It’s important to note that intent does not undo impact. If you feel like something hurtful was said; we should absolutely address it. We're still working on planning out how folk can report incidents anonymously and safely.
8. **Give others the time and space to speak, do not interrupt.**  It can be difficult to work up the nerve for some people to contribute their thoughts to a large group. Allow others time to collect their thoughts and contribute to the conversation. 
9. **Design safe(r) spaces.** There's no such thing as a perfectly "safe" space, but we can do our part in making things safe_r_. Normalizing how we share failures, and how we comfort one another in times of discomfort key.

## ⚠️ Sharing a concern, learning from our mistakes, and discussing guideline breakpoints ⚠️ 
This is a high priority item for our community to figure out.
