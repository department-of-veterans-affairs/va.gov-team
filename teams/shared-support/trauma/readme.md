# VA Trauma Community
Welcome to the VA trauma community ✨
We're a grassroots, volunteer led multi-disciplinary community focused on maturing our approach to trauma from facilitating research to caring for practitioners. 
For more on our purpose, check out our [shared learnings from our big meeting in January](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/shared-support/trauma/notes/2023-01-23.md).

## How do I join?
Anyone can join, regardless of role, title, or status. There's no "official" way of joining, but we usually recommend to:
- [ ] Join our slack channel at `#trauma-practice`. Don't have access to slack? Reach out to Josh at josh.kim@adhocteam.us for help.
- [ ] [Read how we work together and our community guidelines](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/shared-support/trauma/community-guidelines.md).
- [ ] Introduce yourself on slack at `#trauma-practice` or at the next big meeting (this is 100% optional 💙)
- [ ] [Join our next big meeting (email invite)](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/eventedit/cGg0aW8xaDhidmxtZWxqYjFtODNidWQ4amlfMjAyMzA5MTFUMjAwMDAwWiBtZWdhbi5ncmFoYW1AYWRob2N0ZWFtLnVz). Big groups are open to anyone, no sign up needed. You can [check out our agenda or add to it here (google docs)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z5OsfMtlnVp-ntPUi3zPUzw__1mwECqR9bMJygN04h0/edit?usp=sharing).
- [ ] When you feel comfortable, [sign up to join one of our small groups (microsoft form)](https://forms.office.com/r/78LyCdd2RH)! Small groups are safer, more intimate spaces to hold conversation and listen to one another. They're typically comprised of around 7 practitioners who meet on a recurring basis.
- [ ] If you have time, feel free to check out this [introduction to trauma (and resource list)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11W66cjxCgguF_ulVOxet-CszfJB3aTBl-OxJTEeloGg/edit?usp=sharing) or skim through our [past shared learnings in our notes folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/shared-support/trauma/notes)
