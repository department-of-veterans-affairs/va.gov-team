# VA Trauma Community
Welcome to the VA trauma community ‚ú®
We're a grassroots, volunteer led multi-disciplinary community focused on maturing our approach to trauma from facilitating research to caring for practitioners. 
For more on our purpose, check out our [takeaways from a collaborative discussion about our purpose](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/shared-support/trauma/notes/2023-01-23.md#4-patterns-emerged-from-our-conversation-around-our-purpose-).
