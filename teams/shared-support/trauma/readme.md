# VA Trauma Community
Welcome to the VA trauma community ✨
We're a grassroots, volunteer led multi-disciplinary community focused on maturing our approach to trauma from facilitating research to caring for practitioners. 
For more on our purpose, check out our [shared learnings from our big meeting in January](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/shared-support/trauma/notes/2023-01-23.md).

## How do I join?
Anyone can join, regardless of role, title, or status. There's no "official" way of joining, but we usually recommend to:
- [ ] Join our slack channel at `#trauma-practice`. Don't have access to slack? Reach out to Josh at josh.kim@adhocteam.us for help.
- [ ] [Read how we work together and our community guidelines](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/shared-support/trauma/community-guidelines.md).
- [ ] Introduce yourself on slack at `#trauma-practice` or at the next big meeting (this is 100% optional 💙)
- [ ] Sign up for the next small group (on slack) or [join our next big meeting (email invite)](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&amp;tmeid=bGZ0djFzdmRhY2s5NGZ1MmY0aDdlOHV1bXZfMjAyMzAyMjBUMjEwMDAwWiBqb3NoLmtpbUBhZGhvY3RlYW0udXM&amp;tmsrc=josh.kim%40adhocteam.us&amp;scp=ALL).
