## About this transition

This space previously contained detailed team rosters and organizational information. To better protect team member privacy while maintaining transparency around our work, we've implemented a dual-repository approach:

- **Private repository:** Contains sensitive team information, rosters, and organizational details
- **Public repository:** Maintains product documentation, high-level team structure, and public-facing information

## Product information

Product documentation and details remain fully accessible in the public repository:

- **Product directory:** All user-facing products are documented in [/products](../products/README.md)
- **Platform tools and services:** See [VA Platform documentation](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/)

## Team structure overview

For reference, our teams are organized into the following portfolios. Detailed team information is maintained in our private repository.

### Portfolio Structure

- **Benefits Portfolio:** Teams working on benefits-related products and services
- **Digital Experience Portfolio:** Teams working on platform services, sitewide features, and infrastructure  
- **Health Portfolio:** Teams working on health care products and My HealtheVet integration
