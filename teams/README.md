# Teams

This space is for all teams currently working on and with the platform. Teams can utilize this space for team info, workflow documents, project planning, and other general administrative content.

- If you are looking for documentation on VA.gov user-facing products, please see [/products](../products/README.md).
- If you are looking for documentation on the tools and services provided by the platform, please see [VA Platform documentation](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/).

## Required documentation

- **Team README.md file** - Please be sure to fill out the information on your team's README.md file. This file is used to produce the new Team and Product Directory. Use the provided [template](team-readme-template.md).
- [Team charter](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/product-management/team-charter-template.md)

## Current team roster

Currently, there are multiple lists of teams:

- [Atlas](https://www.va.gov/atlas/)
- [VFS Product Directory](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/vfs-product-directory)

Unfortunately, neither is complete nor up-to-date. The Platform Services & Governance crew in Digital Experience is working towards a new solution that will use the README.md files for each team in this directory and YAML files in each product in [products](../products/) to aggregate a list of both teams and products. The goal is to provide a simple way for teams to maintain their own information while still providing the Platform with a source of truth for the teams operating on the platform. Watch this space.

There is also a current list of [crews and pods](crews-and-pods.md).
