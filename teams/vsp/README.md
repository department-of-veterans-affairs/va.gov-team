# Inventory of edits to this branch (see Zenhub issue #1514)

Per discovery session with Rachael Roueche and Andrea Hewitt on 9/10/2019 the following updates have been implemented in the va-gov-team/teams/vsp hierarchy:

* "administrative" folder and its contents removed
* "planning" folder relabeled as "sprint-objectives"
* key documents moved or added to "vsp" folder:
  * VSP Mission, Objectives, Roadmap, and OKRs (currently an uploaded PDF; discussion of linking to Google Doc as this document is updated frequently)
  * VSP-team-charter (this template should supplant readme structure proposed by content/IA team)
  * VSP-team-member-onboarding (currently a blank Markdown file; content to be supplied by Nancy Smith per Rachael)
  * workflow-cadence
* key documents added to individual teams folders:
  * [team-name]-team-charter (this template should supplant readme structure proposed by content/IA team)
  
Potentially desirable updates discussed but not implemented:

* roster document for each team folder
* editing path to "va.gov.team/teams/vsp/programs" to reduce confusion prompted by multiple folders with the same name at different levels of hierarchy
  
**All content below this line is legacy and should be folded into VSP-team-charter.md**
