# Sprint Objectives ROE

Their are a few key goals of VSP Sprint Objectives:

1. Via the act of setting them, serve as a gut check that the work you're prioritizing and the evolution of your features and services are in line with the strategic objectives of VSP overall.
1. Give DSVA an idea of what you'll be taking on and why (i.e. the impact you hope to achieve with that work) so they can provide feedback based on their priorities and based on other VA-wide info they may be aware of.
1. Via transparency into our planning and status report, enable DSVA to perform their fiduciary (that's not the right word?) duty and pay us based on how well we fulfilled our commitments.
1. Surface opportunities for cross-collaboration, and spur cross-team discussion where needed.
