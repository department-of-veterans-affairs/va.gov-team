# Sprint Objectives Rules of Engagement

There are a handful of key goals for VSP Sprint Objectives:

`1.` Via the act of setting them, serve as a gut check that your prioritizations and the evolution of your features and services are in line with the strategic objectives of VSP overall.

`2.` Give DSVA an idea of what you'll be taking on and why (i.e. the impact you hope to achieve with that work) so they can provide feedback based on their priorities and based on other VA-wide info they may be aware of.

`3.` Via transparency into our planning and status report, enable DSVA to perform their fiduciary (that's not the right word?) duty and pay us based on how well we fulfilled our commitments.

`4.` Surface opportunities for cross-collaboration, and spur cross-team discussion where needed.

## How to brainstorm Sprint Objectives

1. Review VSP Bets and OKRs and your team OKRs to think about how you want to align to the overall strategy
1. Review DSVA recommendations to see if there’s anything your team may want to do to contribute
1. Review your team's Backlog to see if there’s anything high priority to start pulling in
1. Review prior sprint to see if any work needs to continue, or if you need to change course to align per ^
1. Check your team’s upcoming PTO to see if you need to cut back accordingly
1. Check anticipated support needs, and when high volume is expected, cut back on other work accordingly

## How to write Sprint Objectives
- Orient your Objectives under a Bet sub-header.
- State an intended outcome and value proposition, not an individual task.
- Format: _We will..._ `[Verb] _______ so that [intended  audience] can ________.`
- They should usually be small enough that they won't stay the same every sprint for the next 3 sprints.
- Link objectives to the epic or super epic they are a part of
- Don't be _too_ ambitious in the volume and scope for the sprint, leave about 20% space for unexpected work or challenges.
- Move any good ideas that you want to keep track of but won't be focusing on this sprint to your ZenHub backlog to evaluate in the future.

_Note: if your objectives map 1:1 to GitHub issues, that's an indicator that they're probably not quite right_

## Cadence
- Have regular standing meetings (weekly?) to evaluate your backlog and groom epics, so you're not doing a huge amount of grooming during Sprint Planning later.
- Sprint End Week:
  - Monday: start brainstorming potential sprint objectives
  - Tuesday morning: Finish your draft objectives for DSVA review
  - Tuesday afternoon / Wednesday morning: review DSVA's feedback
  - Wednesday: do Sprint Planning, using the objectives as your guide for which GitHub issues should be in the Current Sprint.
  - Wednesday EOD: Submit finalized objectives for DSVA awareness

## How to update Sprint Objectives for the Report
- Add a status symbol in front of each objective for your team
- Add a link to an artifact (ideal, even if it's WIP) or to a GH issue (if "artifact" doesn't make sense) for each objective
- For any objectives that you think might not be complete this sprint, in italics below it, describe why and what you've done about it (deprioritize and put in your backlog? continue next sprint? pivot to different approach? pass to another team?)

**Bet: Scalability**

Support current VSA teams' use cases related to feature toggles while continuing discussions with other teams to help identify and prioritize work in support of additional use cases.

**Bet: Scalability**

Capture and reconfigure "bad" alerts Sentry alerts to reduce noise and free up team brain space and time.

**Bet: Support**

Orientation for _team ABC, DEF, and GHI_ so they are empowered to work in an agile, human-centered way.

**Bet: Support**

Support VFS teams with their analytics questions so they can move forward without delay.

**Bet: Support**

Capture VA.gov and Platform issues and triage them to the appropriate team for resolution.

**Bet: Orientation**

Test "pre-orientation" with VAOS PM and DSVA lead to see if it makes general orientation more tailored and effective.
