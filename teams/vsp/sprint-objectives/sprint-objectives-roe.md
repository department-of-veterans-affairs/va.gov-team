# Sprint Objectives ROE

Their are a few key goals of VSP Sprint Objectives:

`1.` Via the act of setting them, serve as a gut check that the work you're prioritizing and the evolution of your features and services are in line with the strategic objectives of VSP overall.

`2.` Give DSVA an idea of what you'll be taking on and why (i.e. the impact you hope to achieve with that work) so they can provide feedback based on their priorities and based on other VA-wide info they may be aware of.

`3.` Via transparency into our planning and status report, enable DSVA to perform their fiduciary (that's not the right word?) duty and pay us based on how well we fulfilled our commitments.

`4.` Surface opportunities for cross-collaboration, and spur cross-team discussion where needed.

### How to brainstorm Sprint Objectives

1. Review VSP Bets and OKRs and your team OKRs to think about how you want to align to the overall strategy
1. Review prior sprint to see if any work needs to continue, or if you need to change course to align per ^
1. Review your team's Backlog to see if there’s anything high priority to start pulling in
1. Review DSVA recommendations to see if there’s anything your team may want to do to contribute
1. Check your team’s upcoming PTO to see if you need to cut back accordingly
1. Check anticipated support needs, and when high volume is expected, cut back on other work accordingly

### How to write Sprint Objectives
- Objectives should state an intended outcome and value proposition, not individual tasks.
- They should clearly tie back to the various VSP "bets".
- They should be small enough that they won't stay the same every sprint for the next 3 sprints.
- Don't be _too_ ambitious, leave about 20% space for unexpected work or challenges.
