# Q2 2020 Leadership Initiatives

### Problem Statement
Teams don't have what they need today to understand overall platform vision and priorities, or initiatives across other platform teams and how they fit together as a greater whole. This makes it hard for teams to coordinate/prioritizez depdencies, or make calls of trade-offs. It often feels as if we are a bunch of teams working on a bunch of stuff, rather than a cohesive set of teams all contributing toward a shared vision.

#### Initiatives
- [Publish clear VSP north star and vision](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/8129)
- [Launch strategy for regular VSP success measurement communication](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/3112)
- [Launch VSP internal communication strategy](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/8120)
- [Track current + in progress Platform features and services, and which VSP team owns what](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/8482)
- [Publish and maintain a priority matrix, to aid in coordination cross-team efforts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/8860)

### Problem Statement
Today we aren't eating our own dog food. We ask VFS teams to do usability testing, write product outlines for every initiative, create KPIs and release plans, yet we don't really do those things for our own work. This makes it hard for us to narrow our focus and deliver good end-to-end experiences and solutions to problems, as opposed to moving from one one-off tool / doc to the next. It also makes it hard track, celebrate, and communicate our progress and impact.

#### Initiatives
- [Launch strategy to help VSP teams treat their initiatives as things w/release plans and measurements](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/8123)
- [Publish standard definition of done or checklist to use for all VSP initiatives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/8131)

### Problem Statement
As the volume and velocity of VFS teams continues to grow, we will start becoming a bottleneck and/or burn out our teammates if we don't also scale our people, tooling, and processes to meet demand in a healthy way.

#### Initiatives
- [Write up and socialize VSP's scaling model](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/8132)
- [Create template for new software categorization and evaluation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/8128)
- [Start "listening sessions" as space to hear VSP team mates](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/8308)
- [Publish approach for how we handle out-of-band requests from top VA stakeholders](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/8119)

### Problem Statement
We don't have clear expectations of what's expected and when for quarterly planning, which has resulted in VSP teammates waiting a long time for the information they need from leadership, and has resulted in some "backwards" planning like doing team roadmaps before new overall OKRs have been published, or doing some pain point workshops before roadmapping, and others after.

#### Initiatives
- [Formalize quarterly planning / roadmapping timeline and process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/8124)
