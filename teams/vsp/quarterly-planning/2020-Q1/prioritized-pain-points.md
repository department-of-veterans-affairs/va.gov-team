# Overall VSP Pain Points

Ranked in order of importance/urgency based on Leadership + Client's review of team health survey feedback, past retros, and gaps between VSP current state and vision. These pain points are the basis for the prioritization of initiatives on Leadership's roadmap.

---

1. Code / PR reviews are super time consuming, and are burning people out
2. VSP team members don't know what success looks like for their work. People want more clear guidance from VA on expectations, and in the absence of that guidance, it feels like VSP success is directly tied to VFS Teams success, which is a lot of pressure.
3. There's uncertainty around how Platform could/should scale beyond current capacity
4. The quantity of work is too high. Teammates feel VSP has bigger plans than it has resources to execute, and feel constantly behind as a result. There aren't enough big blocks of time to concentrate.
5. VSP team members aren't satisfied with the feedback they have received throughout this year. People feel it's hard to get clear critical feedback from managers or peers. Does silence from the top mean things are going well?
6. VSP team members don't feel their product manager understands their work and advocates for the things thy need to be effective.
7. VSP team members don't feel that on their product team, administrative or clerical tasks that don’t have a specific owner are fairly divided.
8. The Analytics team is frequently pulled in different directions, and doesn't have the staffing it needs to strategize and execute
9. Other teams / stakeholders don't have visibility into Platform priorities
10. Despite best efforts, CMS is still taking up a lot of our time
11. The Service Design team frequently gets pulled in different directions, and generally has unclear goals/guidance from Leadership + Clients
12. We don't have a long term ownership / architectural plan for vets-api
13. We're providing support for external services (like GIDS), when our original mission was just VFS teams *(could be mitigated through initiatives for 1 and 2)*
14. Riskiness of reviewing (or not reviewing) vets-changes, bigger risk/blast radius of problems in vets-api than in FE code *(could be mitigated through initiatives for 12)*
15. We don't have holistic Customer feedback mechanisms *(initiatives already under way through Service Design and Product Support teams)*
16. VSP team members don't feel satisfied with theier work. They'r mired in support, and prefer building things to creating process and documentation. *(could be mitigated through initiatives for 1 and 4)*
17. VSP team members don't feel that on their product team, failure causes inquiry.
18. VSP team members don't feel they are growing in their practice area *(could be mitigated through initiatives for 1 and 5)*
19. Design review process isn't ideal
20. DEPO isn't able to easily see the volume of PR reviews
21. Identity's mission / kickoff / overlap w/other teams is confusing *(initiatives to hand off to Christine already under way)*
22. How might we mitigate against blowback as we encounter the growing pains of being an open repo? So that we can defend the “default to open” approach if/when we encounter aversion to this model.
23. There's ambiguity of us doing work for VFS teams vs. providing tools/support for them to do their own work, by different practice area
