## Triage
- Improve application error metrics (i.e. get FE & BE application errors more integrated with existing on-call infrastructure & procedures)

- Support VFS team operations needs (including CMS)
- Reframe risks with issues in public repos with proposal for DSVA to analyze
- Finish determining LOE and timing of CMS infra/ops transition
- Port remaining epics to `va.gov-team` (dependent on discovery work on public/private repo guidance)
- Access models for CMS infrastructure move
- Coninue VAEC migration (moving Jenkins, tearing down old infrastructure)
