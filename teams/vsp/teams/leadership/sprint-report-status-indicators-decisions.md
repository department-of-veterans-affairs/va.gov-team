# Sprint report status indicators

Creating this document to hold the ideas for the various emojis associated with the status indicators on each Sprint Report.

### Ideas

- **Unstarted work** (accompanied by explanation) [emoji ideas: 🛑stop sign / ⭕empty circle, ⛔no entry]
- **In progress work** (accompanied by explanation) [emoji ideas: ➡️ right arrow / 🕑 clock, 🌀cyclone]
- **Completed / fulfilled work** [emoji ideas: ✔️ heavy checkmark / ✅ checkmark in a box]
- **New, unplanned work** [emoji ideas: 💭thought bubble / ⭐ star / 💡lightbulb / 💎gemstone / 🔷 blue diamond / 🔶 orange diamond]

### Decisions
Each indicator should be accessible to folks with vision impairment and color blindness. The emojis should be unique in shape and have a contrast ratio that exceeds 3:1 against adjacent colors ([WebAIM reference](https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/#sc1411)). 

The following selections meet this criteria and should be used in our sprint reports:

#### Unstarted work 
⭕ - The empty circle emoji has a contrast ratio of 4.73

#### In progress work 
🌀 - The cyclone emoji has a contrast ratio of 3.37

#### Completed / fulfilled work
✅ - checkmark in a box has a contrast ratio of 3.67

#### New, unplanned work
🔶 - The orange diamond emoji has a contrast ratio of 3.08

~🔷 - The blue diamond emoji has a contrast ratio of 5.59~

Update: Swapping out the blue diamond for the orange one so that each one has a unique color.
