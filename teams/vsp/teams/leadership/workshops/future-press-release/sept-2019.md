## Goals

- Contribute to shifting mindset from "reactive" to "proactive"

## Format / Structure
- 2 hr virtual workshop with self-reflection time, writing time, and group discussion time
- 4 instances over the course of 2 weeks, so people can choose the one that best works w/their schedule

## Findings after Workshop 1
- 5 participants
- The first part of the meeting took way longer than expected
- "What's a platform you love and why" resulted in insighful responses!
- I wanted to give privacy for the North Star exploration so they could discuss w/o feeling judged, but that means I didn't get a sense of what they were talking about and couldn't guide them / push them to go further. Not sure they got beyond the "current day" VSP concept based on their later FPRs.
- There were a few times when ideas were thrown out for VA.gov features, not VSP features.
- The scale and blue heart votes are really interesting. I feel almost the opposite on a lot of them - which makes me wonder if some folks don't fully understand our mission and north star, but also makes me question my own 
- FPRs were good in terms of their focus on outcomes and concepts we should lean into, which resulted in good "how might we" statements, but didn't result in very many innovative ideas or forward looking big bets.

**Participant Feedback**
- One person said they thought it was a great workshop
- Another person said they appreciate that leadership is listening to the whole team, and that their voice will get to be a part of the overall vision.
- Aside from those 2 comments, there has been a lot of radio silence which I interpret as negative. My hypotheses: they didn't understand why we did this, weren't impressed w/the outputs, don't see the value / thought it was a waste of time, aren't sure what to do with the outputs.

### Adjustments after Workshop 1
- Made the North Star and FPR questions more pointed and less numerous
- Removed some slides that seem to add extra time and less value (VSP mission today and north star)
- Updated timing for the various parts of the Agenda
- Made the North Star part a full group discussion w/me there to facilitate
- Might ask 3rd party (Emily) to send out a poll to get ppls' true feeling about how it went
- Extended the time horizon for the FPR (from "one year" to "2021") to attempt to get minds further away from the "now"
- Added idea to Sprint 10 for leadership to distill the Story of Platform, so our own team members can understand how we're different and thus understand how to better contribute to the mission.
