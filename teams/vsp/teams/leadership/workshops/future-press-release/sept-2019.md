## Agenda


## Findings after Workshop 1
- The first part of the meeting took way longer than expected
- "What's a platform you love and why" resulted in insighful responses!
- I wanted to give privacy for the North Star exploration so they could discuss w/o feeling judged, but that means I didn't get a sense of what they were talking about and couldn't guide them / push them to go further. Not sure they got beyond the "current day" VSP concept based on their later FPRs.
- There were a few times when ideas were thrown out for VA.gov features, not VSP features.
- The scale and blue heart votes are really interesting, I feel almost the opposite on a lot of them.
- One person said they thought it was a great workshop
- Another person said they appreciate that leadership is listening to the whole team, and that their voice will get to be a part of the overall vision.
- Aside from those 2 comments, there has been a lot of radio silence which I interpret as negative.

### Adjustments after Workshop 1
- Made the North Star and FPR questions more pointed and less numerous
- Updated timing for the various parts of the Agenda
