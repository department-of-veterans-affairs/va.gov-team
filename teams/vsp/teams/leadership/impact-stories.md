### Making ATO updates more efficient w/a modularized PDF generator
Before this PDF generator existed, each time an update was needed for an ATO document, the logistics of downloading and converting the doc added a lot of extra time to the editing process. Individuals would have to log into EMASS, download the doc, convert from PDF to Word for editability, and then back to PDF again - cleaning up formatting inconsistencies with each conversion.

In August 2020, the platform launched a PDF generator for a few key documents to start (the Incident Response Plan, Contingency Plan, and the Disaster Recovery Plan) that auto-generates the components of the PDF content directly from GitHub. This means developers can make their updates directly in GitHub, and can generate the PDF from there. Cutting out up to 40 min of logistics time from each editing instance.

Given that updates happen to ATO docs about X times a year, as this feature expands to all ATO docs, it has the ability to save VA about x hours of needless administrative PDF handling work per year. This net time saved will only increase over time as more VFS teams come on board and thus make more updates to ATO docs per year.
