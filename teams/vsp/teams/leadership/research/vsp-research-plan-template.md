# VSP Research Plan for [Team, Product, Date]

## Goals	
1. What product [tool/service/document/process] & VSP team are you doing this research for? (VSP teams: Product Support, Content & IA, Insights & Analytics, Operations, Service Design, Front-End Tools, Back-End Tools, Identity)
	
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? Link to the product outline.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	


## Method	
1. What method of research are you planning? 	Sample Methodologies: Directed interviews; ethnographic interviews; contextual inquiry; card sorts; tree tests; guerilla usability testing; usability testing with low- or high-fidelity prototypes;
Also mention: in-person moderated, remote moderated, remote unmoderated
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (Zoom, GoToMeeting, etc.)*	

4.	What will you be testing? *(Tool, process, design, documentation, etc. Provide links if possible.)* 	

## Participants and Recruitment	

1.  Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant? (Mention: Number of participants, practice areas, VFS team, VFS product. Please keep in mind that we have a limited number of VFS teams, and we should avoid going to the same people and teams back-to-back.)

2.  What is your recruitment strategy? (Usually it is a Slack message directly to the team or team members. Contact the Design Lead if you need help getting in touch with anyone.)	

## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	(Schedule your research at least 1 week in advance if possible to give your participants time to organize their calendars) 	

2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling: e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)

4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.) that are hopefully flexible enough to accommodate our participants' busy schedules. Keep in mind that VFS team members are also remote and live in different time zones. Try and keep research sessions during normal working hours.	


5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	

## Team Roles
