## Intro
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [name] and I am a [role] on [team]. As you may know, VSP is doing a discovery sprint this week regarding our Infrastructure. We've got a few other folks from the discovery sprint team here today as well who are observing and taking notes and may chime in with questions as we go. We want to hear what your experiences have been like working with the VA.gov infrastructure, and want to hear your honest opinions! We welcome any and all feedback.

Before we start, there are a few things I want to mention: 

This entire session is scheduled for an hour. We don't want to keep you any longer than that, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. 

Is it alright with you if I record this call as we talk today? We'll use the recordings to confirm that we captured the conversation accurately, and we'll destroy them after we complete analysis. No comments will be attributed to you directly. 

[If yes, start recording]

Alright, we're recording!
