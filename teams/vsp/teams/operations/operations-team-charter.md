#### Sprint Planning
Outline work to be done this sprint in order to accomplish the team's goals
Agenda
- 1st Wednesday of every sprint @ 1:00pm EST
- 1 hour

#### Ops All hands
Talk and demo work we are working on to ensure we are aware of current work in a bit more techincal detail. 

- 2nd Thursday of every sprint
- 1/2 hour
- talk through what different pieces of work we are doing right now and ask any questions that come from it in order to brake down any silos on the team. 

#### Leads Grooming 
Stragetgic meeting to plan work for the team and work we need/want to accomplish. 

- 2nd Friday of every sprint
- 1 hour
- talk through what different pieces of work we are doing right now and ask any questions that come from it in order to brake down any silos or clinfd spots on the team. 

#### Issue Etiquette
For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):

- Estimate
- Title that explains task
- Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
- Labels: Operations
- User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
- Nested in an Epic
   - If an Epic is created a super epic is assigned.

All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

#### Ticket Estimation
Teams will use the following complexity estimation to point tickets before Sprint Planning. Teams will adjust points during sprint if required time to complete the ticket changes.
Points: Complexity Estimate
- 1 = ~1 hour
- 2 = ~2-4 hour
- 3 = ~ 1 day (8-10 hours)
- 5 = ~2-4 days
- 8 = ~1 week
- 13 = ~1 sprint (2 weeks) (this needs to broken down into smaller tickets)
- 21 = 1 -2 months
- 40 = super epics (2 + months)

#### Team Norms
- Be respectful, both online and off
- Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
- Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
- We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
- Let’s have fun and do great work!
- Don't over use @here and @channel in slack, only use in a time sensitive situation.

   - We maintain our meetings and OOO here.

#### Slack:

This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.

#### GitHub
GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.

#### General things
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
