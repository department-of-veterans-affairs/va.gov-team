## How we work

### Workflow + Cadence

#### Stand-up
Check in on people and product progress

#### Retro
Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, what can be improvemed, what questions people have, and any action items

- 1st Wednesday of every sprint 12:30pm EST
- 30 min
Agenda
- Follow up on action items from previous retro
- Time for writing cards if necessary (please write cards ahead of time!)
- Voting on cards
- Discussion of most-voted items
Output

#### Sprint Planning
Outline work to be done this sprint in order to accomplish the team's goals
Agenda
- 1st Wednesday of every sprint @ 1:00pm EST
- 1 hour
- Discuss the sprint objectives
- Overview of resourcing for the sprint
- Break down the sprint's user stories into tasks
- Point the tasks
- Review the top backlog tasks
Output
- Sprint backlog made up of pointed tasks required to meet the stories' acceptance criteria
- Documentation of sprint goal on the #dragons-team Slack channel purpose
- Team understanding of the top backlog tasks


#### Ops All hands/ Grooming
Assess and update workload for remainder of sprint

- 2nd Thursday of every sprint
- 1 hour
- talk through what different pieces of work we are doing right now and ask any questions that come from it in order to brake down any silos or clinfd spots on the team. 
- 2nd part: assess and update workload for remainder of sprint. Think about work that needs to happen in the next sprint. 


#### Issue Etiquette
For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):

- Estimate
- Title that explains task
- Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
- Labels: Operations
- User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
- Nested in an Epic
   - If an Epic is created a super epic is assigned.

All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

#### Ticket Estimation
Teams will use the following complexity estimation to point tickets before Sprint Planning. Teams will adjust points during sprint if required time to complete the ticket changes.
Points: Complexity Estimate
1 = ~1 hour
2 = ~2-4 hour
3 = ~ 1 day (8-10 hours)
5 = ~2-4 days
8 = ~1 week
13 = ~1 sprint (2 weeks) (this needs to broken down into smaller tickets)
21 = 1 -2 months
40 = super epics (2 + months)

#### Team Norms

- Be respectful, both online and off
- Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
- Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
- We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
- Let’s have fun and do great work!
- Don't over use @here and @channel in slack, only use in a time sensitive situation.

#### Slack:

This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.

#### GitHub
GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.

#### General things
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
