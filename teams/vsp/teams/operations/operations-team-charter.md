Talk about work we want to do in the coming sprint. Prioitize this work and see what we can move forward with and what we can't.
Agenda

- Get plans for sprint in order so we have a plan before planning.

#### Sprint Planning
Outline work to be done this sprint in order to accomplish the team's goals
Agenda
- 1st Wednesday of every sprint right after standup
- 45 mins
- Discuss the sprint objectives
- Overview of resourcing for the sprint

- 2nd Wednesday of every sprint, right after standup.
-  45 mins
- Talk through what different pieces of work we are doing right now and ask any questions that come from it in order to brake down any silos on the team. 

#### Pre Planning 
Stragetgic meeting to plan work for the team and work we need/want to accomplish. 

- 2nd Friday of every sprint
- 1 hour

- talk through what different pieces of work we are doing right now and ask any questions that come from it in order to brake down any silos or clinfd spots on the team. 

#### Grooming 
Assess and update workload for remainder of sprint

- 1st Friday of every sprint
- 45 mins right after standup
- revisit the Ready columns  


#### Issue Etiquette
For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Ops Issue Template”):

- Estimate
- Title that explains task
- Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
- Labels: Operations,  and Needs Grooming (if applicable)
- User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
- Nested in an Epic
   - If an Epic is created a super epic is assigned.

All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

#### Ticket Estimation
Teams will use the following complexity estimation to point tickets before Sprint Planning. Teams will adjust points during sprint if required time to complete the ticket changes.
Points: Complexity Estimate
- 1 = ~1 hour
- 2 = ~2-4 hour
- 3 = ~ 1 day (8-10 hours)
- 5 = ~2-4 days
- 8 = ~1 week
- 13 = ~1 sprint (2 weeks) (this needs to broken down into smaller tickets)
- 21 = 1 -2 months
- 40 = super epics (2 + months)

#### Team Norms

- We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
- Let’s have fun and do great work!

#### Slack:

This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.

#### GitHub
GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.

#### General things
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
