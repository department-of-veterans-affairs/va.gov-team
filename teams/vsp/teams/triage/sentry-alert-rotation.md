# Sentry Alerting (On-Point) Triage Rotation

## Purpose
Not every bug can be fixed, but every bug _can_ be triaged.

Triaging all the issues that come in is a team effort, but a little leadership goes a long way. Each week, a Triage team engineer will take point on triaging the issues from our intake sources.

We'll give this process a test run by triaging Sentry alerts in the `#vfs-sentry-alerts` Slack channel.

## Responsibilities
When we get an alert in the `#vfs-sentry-alerts` Slack channel, the on-point engineer will triage the issue by doing any of the following:

- Tweak the alert rule
- Make the code fix
- Mark as "ignored" or "resolved" in Sentry
- Create a GitHub issue for the Sentry issue

Stating the action taken by way of Slack thread and/or Sentry Issue comment is encouraged. This helps indicate to others that this Sentry Alert has been looked at.

### Getting help
If the on-point engineer doesn't know how to effectively triage the issue (for example, if they don't know how to assess the user impact), they're encouraged to reach out to the other Triage engineers for guidance.


## Schedule
The on-point responsibilities are rotated among the engineers of the Triage team on a weekly basis. Weeks are defined as beginning on Monday and encompass only business hours.

**Rotation:**
- Chris Valarida
- Bill Ryan
- Keifer Furzland
- Lindsey Hattamer

### Rotation on vacation
Going on vacation when you're on point? Don't forget to ask your teammates to trade some days with you.

### Rotation and sickness
Notice the on-point person is out sick and didn't have a chance to ask anybody to cover? Bring it up to the team to make sure the responsibilities are covered.
