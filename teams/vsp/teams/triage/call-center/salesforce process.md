# SalesForce Process

SalesForce is the CRM that is used by the WHH.  In the current state, there are no specific fields for va.gov issues.  Since February 2019, there have been no modifications to SalesForce, only fixes that have been in the pipeline.  

There are future state SalesForce processes that have been documented and relayed to the WHH.  There is currently a stall on which CRM will be implemented, with the options being SaleForce or Microsoft Dynamics.  It has been iterated that WHH leadership will make a decision in the next 45 days.

Two reports live in SalesForce, one being the original va.gov non compaints, which captured 22 records from WHH agents.  The other being Case Notes OP1, which captured 1,1911 records.  Only two records from the original report did NOT populate on the newly created report.

The Case Notes OP1 report will be the report that is used moved forward since it captures all issues that need to be resolved.  The original report VA.gov Non Compaints will no longer be used as the primary report to pull issues from.  However, it will be used over the next few months as a comparison tool to ensure that all issues are being captured.
