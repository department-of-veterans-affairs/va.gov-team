During Sprint 10 it was the goal of the Call Center lead to be able to perform the IRIS and SalesForce reporting process.  The objective
was to gather all information from both sources, and report to the Triage team or the appropriate team.  

## Challenges

  ### IRIS: Inquiry Reporting and Information System
  This is used by individuals visiting VA.gov and uses the 'Contact Us' option.  Issues that are reported to the Call Center team are not
  always technical in nature.
  All details are not gathered when exporting issues from IRIS into Excel.  Once the spreadsheet is composed, the Call Center lead has to go
  back into each individual issue to copy the complete description in order to paste it into the Excel Spreadsheet.
  Once the information is emailed to the Call Center lead from the VA.gov account to the adhoc account, the spreadsheet is not supported by 
  ZH and therefore cannot be pasted into the ticket for review by the Triage or appropriate team.
  - 63 Issues
    - 37 non technical issues that was responded to 
    - 14 not reviewed as of 10/11/2019
    - 9 issues reported to Triage or appropriate team 
    
    
  ### SalesForce: Used by the WHVAH 
  This system is used by the agents at the WHVAH in order to input information that customers are calling about.  It was discovered that not 
  all issues are ones that can be addressed by the Call center team.  This is due to the mis-labeling by WHVAH agents; due to this, not all 
  issues are being reported correctly.
  All details are not gathered when exporting issues from SalesForce into Excel.  Once the spreadsheet is composed, the Call Center lead has to go
  back into each individual issue to copy the complete description in order to paste it into the Excel Spreadsheet.
  Once the information is emailed to the Call Center lead from the VA.gov account to the adhoc account, the spreadsheet is not supported by 
  ZH and therefore cannot be pasted into the ticket for review by the Triage or appropriate team. 
  - 89 Issues
    - 18 possible technical issues
    - 3 labeled as 'Other' in Case Category
    - 4 labeled as 'va.gov, va.gov issues, login issues, or issues with website
    
    
    ## Improvements
    Currently, the Triage team is in the discovery phase of how to improve the IRIS system.  This is so that the user has a better experience
    and is able to clearly report their issues to the appropriate place without so many drop down options.
    Triage is in the discovery phase of how to automate the process of uploading the spreadsheet into a ZH ticket.  
    The workaround for the Call Center lead is to continue to copy and paste until there is more information on IRIS and how to expand the 
    description character limit.  This is the same for SalesForce, since the WHVAH is not able to make any modifications until a decision
    is made on which system they will be working in.
