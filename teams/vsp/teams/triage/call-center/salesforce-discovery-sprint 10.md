During Sprint 10 it was discovered that gathering informaiton from this system is also more complex than once thought.
The process of reporting issues should be automated as much as possible. 

## Pros:
- Customer can get assistance from a live agent
- Ablility to identify issues that veterans are having
- Ablility to report issues to the appropriate team for research or resolution


## Cons:
- Not all issues are technical issues
- Not all issues are labeled correctly by the external Call Center agent
- When exporting, the entire description is not carried over to the Excel spreadsheet
- Having to go back to each issue individually, open the issue, copy the description, and then paste it into the spreadsheet
- Emailing the spreadsheet from my VA.gov email address to my adhoc email address
- ZH not supporting the format in which the spreadsheet was created
- Having to copy each issue from the spreadsheet and entering into ZH ticket
