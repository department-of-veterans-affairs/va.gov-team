# Contact Center Lead Mission:

Improve the Veteran experience on Va.gov by...

1) Empowering the White House Hotline to better support Veterans
1) Ensuring resolution of VA.gov issues reported to us by Contact Centers
1) Using Contact Center data to help VFS Teams to improve their products

*There are a LOT of opportunities we could lean into as ways to improve the incorporation of contact centers into the VSP and VA.gov landscapes, and these opportunities will require collaboration across many VSP and VFS teams. Given this complexity (the blue sky scope, and multi-team collaboration), it's critical for the Contact Center Lead to provide proactive recommendations around what activities to prioritise and deprioritise from quarter to quarter and sprint to sprint, and to collaborate closely with VSP Leadership to align on that prioritisation.*
