## VA.gov Technical Support: The Problem
There is still no call center that has taken on the responsibility of handling VA.gov technical issues. The White House VA Hotline (WHVAH) was identified to fulfill this role but has since been given additional responsibilities (Mission Act and Tier 1 Calls) and has deprioritized VA.gov work. Furthermore, WHVAH has not acted as collaborative partners, even prior to the addition of new business lines. Since the launch of VA.gov, this is where we stand as it relates to call center:

## WHVAH
Conducted one training with the WHVAH on VA.gov issues. Not invited back to do any further training.
The CRM has not been updated to track our issues. 
Unable to schedule consistent meetings or achieve agreement on timelines and tasks.

## HRC
Continues to handle VA.gov calls but does not share details or data with us. We were able to finally get 4 months of tracked data, but this appears to be a one off situation.
Extreme frustration from the team because we haven’t transitioned our work to another call center. 

## IRIS
This is our primary form of data collection. It is a manual process, a bad user experience for the veteran, and is not sustainable with only two individuals handling the issues. 

Given the current status quo of this project, we feel we need to find a new approach to establishing a call center that will handle VA.gov technical issues by the end of the calendar year.

* Option 1: Create a formal contract/agreement with a VA.gov call center: This would align most closely with the approach we have been taking but would force the issue of our partner agreeing to clearly defined expectations for how we work together. While it would seem to make the most sense to present this idea to the WHVAH first, HRC might be a better option given their experience with VA.gov and track record of delivery. 
  - Pros: In line with previous work, formalizes relationship and expectations
  - Cons: Agreement might not be followed or followed so closely that we don’t have space for iteration and adaptation, will come at a monetary cost, 

* Option 2: Stand up our own VA.gov call center: This is an option that is probably the costliest and  most complicated but would enable us to have direct control over the operations and quality of the group handling VA.gov technical issues. 
  - Pros: VSP owned and operated, ensure seamless coordination across teams, make technology decisions that make sense based on our needs.
  - Cons: High cost, contributes to VA.gov call center problem (there are too many), complicated and potentially time-consuming process, hard to pass off to VA. 

* Option 3: Build up VSP’s call center capacity: If we continue down the current path with WHVAH, it would help to build out the number of people answering online questions through IRIS and MS Dynamics if the transition continues to be slow and uncoordinated. 
  - Pros: More robust stopgap measure that could make a difference, more data, more answered questions for veterans.
  - Cons: Not a long-term solution, means no dedicated place for a veteran to call and get help, more money than it’s worth.
