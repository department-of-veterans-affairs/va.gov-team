Escalation Process (Current state)

Once the call comes in (WHH process)
WHH agent will determine if the call is related to VA.gov:
Record Type = Non-compliant
Case Category = Other
Agent will determine if the issue is Tier 1 or Tier 2/3
If the issue is technical (Tier 2/3) and can’t be resolved by agent, subject = T VA.gov
If the issue is non-technical (Tier 1) and can be resolved by agent, subject = NT VA.gov
Description of issue in the case category field
If the issue is Tier 2/3 the WHH agent will communicate to the user that their case is being escalated and provide the VA.gov triage team’s SLA for a response.
Once the issue is in Salesforce (VA.gov triage team process)
