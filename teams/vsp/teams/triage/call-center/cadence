In order to for Call Center, Insight/Analytics, and Triage to remain on the same page and not duplicate efforts the following decisions have been made collectively.

- Kimberley and Chante will attend Insight and Analytics daily standups unless otherwise informed.
- Kimberley will attend Triage meetings held on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
  - Kimberley will report any viable data back to Chante.
- Kimberley and Chante will continue to hold stand up each Tuesday.
- Ad hoc meetings will be held between members (departments) if needed.
- Proper labeling of ZH tickets
  - Triage incident vs Triage
      - Triage = Items that the triage team is working on
      - Triage Incident =  An incident reported from another team that needs to triaged
  - Insight/Analytics
      - Tickets will be flushed out by Chante
      - Tickets not a top priority
- Proper assigning of ZH tickets
    - Chante will determine if Kimberley needs to be added as an assignee to ticket
