During Sprint 10 it was discovered that IRIS (Inquiry Routing and Information System) is complicated for the user as well as the Call Center team.
It was discovered that gathering informaiton from this system is more complex than once thought.  
The entire IRIS reporting process is cumbersome and should be automated as much as possible.

## Pros:
- Email notifications are sent to Outlook.
- Customers have a way to report their issues without having to contact an external call cneter

## Cons:
- Not all issues are technical issues
- Not all issues are able to be answered by the Call Center team from the response template document 
- When exporting, the entire description is not carried over to the Excel spreadsheet
- Having to go back to each issue individually, open the issue, copy the description, and then paste it into the spreadsheet
- Emailing the spreadsheet from my VA.gov email address to my adhoc email address
- ZH not supporting the format in which the spreadsheet was created
- Having to copy each issue from the spreadsheet and entering into ZH ticket
