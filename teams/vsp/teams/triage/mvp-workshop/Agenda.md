# June 2019 Triage & Tier 2+3 Support MVP Flow Workshop Agenda

## Epic reminder
As VA.gov/VSP, I need to ensure any problems users are experiencing are discovered and fixed expeditiously, so Veterans are not impeded from finding/applying for/managing their benefits online.

## Meeting Agenda

**First 50 min**

- Individually: reflect on a time in the past few months when an issue has been reported to us.
- Individually: map ^ process (even if you have big knowledge gaps, no worries!!) on this template:
- Group: discuss the maps, and the happy points and pain points
- Group: create draft Service Blueprint based on ^
- List all possible inputs
- List all possibe outputs
- Vote on criticality of inputs and outputs based on:
  - one
  - two
- Indicate the inputs and outputs that are currently not possible

BREAK

**Second 50 min**

- Circle gaps / unknowns in overall service blueprint
  - Ex: when should something be escalated to Tier 2?
  - Ex: what are expected communication/response/fix time-frames?
  - Ex: what are on-call expectations, how do we prevent burn-out?
  - Ex: how do we get information from Tier 1
  - Ex: after we hand off to someone else to resolve, are we responsible for tracking?
- Decide what to try initially for those circles


BREAK

**Third Hour**

- Document this in diagram + product docs
