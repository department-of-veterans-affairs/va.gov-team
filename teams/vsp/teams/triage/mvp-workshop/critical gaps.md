# Critical Gaps in current Triage process

### MVP Goal
Be able to handle issues that come in, in a reasonable amount of time, and w/o overburdening the Triage team.

## On call

#### How can we ensure on call people have context and access they need?

#### What are on-call expectations, how do we prevent burn-out?
- On call rotation is not just the Triage team, it's folks across the VA.gov ecosystem - including VFS team members when applicable. We can stay w/status quo for the immediate term.

## Downtime email list
#### Who should be on this list?
#### How do we monitor it?

## Prometheus

#### Do we have guidelines on what things should be alerts?

#### How easy is it for others to configure alerts?
- MVP
  - Might not need a huge refactor, but w/VSP transition may need to reconfigure some based on how teams are changing

#### Can we set up alerts for specific VFS teams as part of launch process?

## Sentry
#### What process/guidelines should we have for sentry data hygiene?
#### Would a focus on clean-up here help us better target issues for triage?
#### How can we establish ownership of monitoring, prioritizing, shepherding all things sentry?
- MVP
  - Want to have ownership for this established as a part of MVP, so that in their first sprint the Triage team can focus on this

## Tier 1, 2, 3
#### Whatâ€™s the best way to keep Tier 1 folks informed of known issues/planned downtime?
- Needs to be top priority starting June 12

#### How does something actually get handed off to Tier 2?

#### What are the definitions of the Tiers 1, 2, and 3 and what constitutes a handoff from one to the next?
- MVP

#### What are common issues/resolutions that Tier 1 deals with?

## Outputs
#### What are the best ways to correspond with Veterans (and other VA.gov users)?
#### How can we share expected impact and resolution w/wide audience of stakeholders?
- MVP

## General

#### What is our common language/criteria for issue severity?
- High priority starting June 12

#### What are the response expectations based on issue severity? (e.g low severity issues should have a response in x days and impact fewer than x users)?
- High priority starting June 12

#### How do items get prioritized by VSP and routed to appropriate team (VSP or VFS) for resolution?
#### How do we capture all things triage related into a dashboard/report/activity monitor/etc.?
#### What are the relevant Slack channels for non on-call things? (or should we leverage different method?)
#### If VSP not responsible for resolution, what (if any) output responsibilities?
- High piority starting June 12
