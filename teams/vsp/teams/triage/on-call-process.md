- [Schedule a maintenance window](https://dsva.pagerduty.com/maintenance_windows)
- [Check the on-call schedule](https://dsva.pagerduty.com/schedules)
- [Respond to an incident](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/docs/Incident%20Response%20Playbook.md)
- [Read about the on-call Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/master/Practice%20Areas/Engineering/OnCall#on-call-rotation-standard-operating-procedure)
- [Learn more about a specific alert](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Engineering/Alerts.md)

The [on-call](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/master/Practice%20Areas/Engineering/OnCall) directory in vets.gov-team is the primary source of information for on-call documentation, including [Incident Categorization](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Engineering/OnCall/Incident%20Categorization.md).

The [Emergency Contacts / Information](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops#emergency-contacts--information) section of the devops repo, specifically the [Incident Response Playbook](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/docs/Incident%20Response%20Playbook.md) is an additional source of quality information.

External Service Integration documentation lives in both the [devops repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/tree/master/docs/External%20Service%20Integrations) and [vets.gov-team repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Engineering/OnCall/Services.md)

[PagerDuty](https://dsva.pagerduty.com/schedules) is the authoritative source for the on call schedule. If you do not have access to PagerDuty and need to know who's on call, join the #oncall channel in DSVA Slack.
