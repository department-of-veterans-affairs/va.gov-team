# Medallia Product Outline
---

## Overview
*Medallia is a part of the VSignals, VA-wide solution for receiving customer feedback.*

## Problem Statement
In order to build satisfying experiences for veterans and their families on VA.gov, VFS teams need a way to collect direct user feedback from users as scale so that they can back up their research and quantitive data with direct user sentiment. Medallia is a tool that will enable VFSs to collect feedback specifically for their product directly from users as they use the site.

**How might we implement Medallia so that VFS teams get the information they need to build more satisfying products and give VA.gov users an easy and effective way to provide helpful feedback to the teams building VFSs.**
 
## Desired User Outcomes

VFS teams can easily add surveys to their products so that they can collect direct user feedback.
- They can segment customer satisfaction for their products and dive deeper into feedback
- They can add surveys and survey questions that have already gone through design system and content review
- They can add surveys and survey questions that have already gone through Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) approval

VFS teams receive accurate customer satisfaction data.

VFS teams can easily and accurately compare their user satisfaction data to other products and benefit hubs in the VA.gov ecosystem and VA.gov in general.

VFS teams can easily and accurately share their user satisfaction data to relevant stakeholders.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- VFSs each have unique and different survey intercepts and questions; VA.gov users are bombarded and confused by varying experiences throughout VA.gov
- We collect and accidentally distribute PII
- VA.gov users view the surveys as ways to ask questions and receive feedback from VFS teams
- The data collection is confusing, and VFS teams don't understand how to accurately read the customer satisfaction data

## Desired Business Outcomes

- DEPO is able to use the feedback information to:
    - Understand overall va.gov satisfaction
    - Understand va.gov satisfaction by benefit hub
    - Easily report customer satisfaction and trust to varying stakeholders
- DEPO has VA.gov user trust & satisfaction data collected consistently and can data be easily 
    - Verified for accuracy
    - Pulled from a single source of truth
    - Compare trust and satisfaction data between VFSs, benefit hubs, and VA.gov as a whole
- The VA has a consistent way of collecting veteran trust and satisfaction
- The VA has a more open network of sharing data, including veteran trust and satisfaction data

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- DEPO receives inaccurate customer satisfaction data or data that is not easy to read, and reports inaccurate data to stakeholders
    - DEPO accidentally shared PII
- The VA has an inconsistent way of collecting veteran trust & satisfaction data
