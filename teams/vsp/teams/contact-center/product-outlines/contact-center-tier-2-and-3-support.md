# Contact Center Tier II/III Support

## Overview
Tier II and III support for contact centers provides escalated support when contact center representatives are unable to solve Veterans' problems without further assistance.

## Problem Statement
When things don't work as expected or when Veterans cannot find the information they need on VA.gov and are prevented from completing their tasks, there's a problem. Our primary goals is to provide contact center staff with the right resources to help solve those problems (tier I) for Veterans. When contact center representatives cannot solve those problems, they forward those problems to us (tier II/III). We (contact center team) first try to solve the problems through our troublshooting process and resources but sometimes have to forward to VFS teams (who owns the site pages) to fix the issues. 

## Personas
Veterans and their family members are the primary users of VA.gov for which we provide this support.*

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* Number of issues by tier - looking for improvement over time compared to previous/baseline data (we want to reduce #s in every area) 
* Number of issues by type - i.e. team, task, etc... (same as above, but targeted by type)

## Assumptions
1. If we are able to fix common issues we receive for tier II/III support, we will reduce categorical and overall tier II/III support issues.
2. If we are able to build automation to address any (high volume first) tier II/III issues, we will reduce categorical and overall tier II/III support issues.

Risk: #2 seems most risky as there are unknowns around what we can potentially solve through automation. We may also be heavily dependent on other teams to build the automation or otherwise address these issues.


## Solution Approach

_Describe, in a few sentences and/or bullet points, what you plan to build, and how it will solve the problem. Some questions to think about:_

- We are currently working on aggregating and mining tier II/III support issue data to identify issues which are most common and likely to be solved long-term.
- We plan to fix isssues which can be easily resolved and develop automation for others which require it.
- Developing automation seems to be more efficient long-term than continuing to fix issues one at a time at infinitum.
- We have explicity decided not to include plans to work around issues where we have opportunities to fix them
- Ideally, identifying common issues will allow us to develop best practices to help teams avoid these when building new software in the future.
