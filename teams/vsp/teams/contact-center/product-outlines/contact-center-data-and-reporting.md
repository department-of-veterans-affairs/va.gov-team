_**Guidance**_

_This Product Outline is intended primarily for VSP teams building VSP. Details of what's being built, how it's being built, how its success will be evaluated, and roadmaps are all relevant._

_Because this is VSP-internal, the Product Outline should be located in `/products/platform/`. VFS-facing documentation about this product should be located in `/platform/`._

_Fill out the template below, following italicized guidance for each section._

# Contact Center Data and Reporting

## Overview
Contact center data and reporting provide VA leadership and individual VA.gov development teams insight into issues veterans are having while trying to complete tasks on VA.gov. This information is valuable in helping us improve our service to Veterans. Our data suite also includes satisfaction data which takes a more holistic look at over VA.gov user satisfaction.

## Problem Statement
Veterans regularly experience issues trying to complete tasks on VA.gov. VA leadership and teams building on VA.gov want to understand how well their products and services are working for Veterans. The data helps us understand where the greatest pains are felt and give us insight into our best opportunities to fix issues for Veterans on VA.gov.

## Personas
- VA leadership
- VFS teams 
- Contact Center Team and other VSP teams who want to understand Veteran experience on VA.gov.

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Grafana or other dashboards/reports where possible_
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics, if possible._

Quantitative:
- Number of views by report/dashboard published
- Number of reports/dashboards published

Qualitative:
- Number of issues addressed due to insight from one or more of our reports


#### Baseline KPI Values
- Coming...

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*
1. VA leadership want to see contact center and survey data 
2. VA leadership use contact center and survey data to make decision
3. VFS teams want to see contact center and survey data
4. VFS teams use contact center and survey data to make decisions
5. Contact centers will continue to allow us access to their data
6. Contact centers will provide us with their data (at least the most basic, necessary issue data) on a regular basis

* Numbers 5 & 6 or most risky due to reliance and contact centers and/or their permission for this data couple with past experience of them being hesitant and/or slow to provide it to us.


## Solution Approach

_Describe, in a few sentences and/or bullet points, what you plan to build, and how it will solve the problem. Some questions to think about:_

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

_For non-trivial technical solutions, an [engineering design doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/engineering/design-docs) should be written to deeply explain **How** this product will be built._
