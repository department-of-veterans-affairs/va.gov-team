# VSP Product Outline Template

_**Guidance**_

_This Product Outline is intended primarily for VSP teams building VSP. Details of what's being built, how it's being built, how its success will be evaluated, and roadmaps are all relevant._

_Because this is VSP-internal, the Product Outline should be located in `/products/platform/`. VFS-facing documentation about this product should be located in `/platform/`._

_Fill out the template below, following italicized guidance for each section._

_Delete this guidance stanza and any italicized guidance in the template before checking in your Product Outline._

# Contact Center Data and Reporting

## Overview
*A brief description of the product.*

## Problem Statement
*In a couple of sentences, describe the Who, What, Why, and Where of the challenge / pain point you seek to address.*

## Personas
*Who are the users of this product?*

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Grafana or other dashboards/reports where possible_

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics, if possible._

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

_Describe, in a few sentences and/or bullet points, what you plan to build, and how it will solve the problem. Some questions to think about:_

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

_For non-trivial technical solutions, an [engineering design doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/engineering/design-docs) should be written to deeply explain **How** this product will be built._
