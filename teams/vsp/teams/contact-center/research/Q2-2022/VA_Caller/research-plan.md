# Research Plan for Veteran Caller User Journey, June 2022


## Background
This study is being conducted by the VSP Contact Center team and for the purpose of establishing a verified user journey for VA.gov users who call to use Contact Center services. [This research will be used to inform this documented user journey map.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/40967).

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following:

- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information.
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
- Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov



### Veteran Journey
This research sits within these stages of the Veteran Journey:

  ·  Phase 1, Life Stage: Getting Out through Reinventing myself
  - GI Bill, Finding resources for higher education, working with SCOs 




## Research Goals	
We are trying to learn the following from this research:
 
· Understand the pain points of VA.gov users that use Tier 1 Call Center systems for resolving VA.gov issues. 

· Discover insights and task blockers for VA.gov users that have theirissues routed from Tier 1 to Tier 2 

· Discover insights regarding Tier 1 service teams using VA tools Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics and Ask VA (AVA) to interface with Veterans and/or their beneficaries. 



### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?
  · This research will advance our user journey documentation for veterans callers using Tier 1 and 2 call centers. *Provide potential recommendations for improvements to the support user journey as it relates to resolving VA.gov issues and blockers.*

### Research questions 
1. For VA.gov users what are the most prominent pain points in their user journey from not finding their answer on Va.gov to calling the Tier 1 call centers? 
2. Are the currect expectations for VA.gov users to have their issues resolved or reviewed set correctly by the Tier 1 Call center agent? 

· When did you last encounter a problem on VA.gov, what steps do you take to contact the VA call center about your issue?  

· Can you describe in a few sentences describe the issue? Were you in mobile or on a desktop? 
  Can you recreate the issue that you had on VA.gov? 
  
· Which kind of communication do you rely on the most (phone, email, SMS, assistance with aide, or other)?

· As of this interview, what is the current status of your this issue being handled by the T1 Call Center (In-progress, Rerouted or Resolved?)

· What have been blockers/ difficulties in getting services through your VA call center?

· When recieving a resolution for your most recent issue descrbied, did you feel that you had the answer/resources provided? Yes or No? Please explain.

· Please describe your overall experience when communicating with a VA call center in the beginning of your issue?

· Did you understand the timeframe in which you recieved an overall resolution to your issue?


### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.

· Our hypothesis is that Va.gov user that cannot complete an initial inquiry on VA.gov will often find their way to directly calling the Tier 1 Call center in hope of finding a specific resolution. We want to understand the decisions from why they are opting to call in first- than rather use VA tools such as askVA.gov. We also believe that expectations of timeframe of when their issues (cases) being resolved are not correctly communiticated- thus leading to more frustration. 


## Method	
Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design. 

- User interviews- appropriate for evaluative research
We will conduct remote moderated directed interviews via Zoom with VA.gov users (Veterans) that have used Tier 1 and 2 call center services and VA teams.
