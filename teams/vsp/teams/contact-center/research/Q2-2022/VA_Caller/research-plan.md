[Link to product brief](url goes here).

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following:

- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information.
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
- Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov
- Platform users can build and deploy high-quality products for Veteran


### Veteran Journey
AVA’s improved mobile experience fits within these stages of the Veteran Journey:
  ·  Phase 1, Life Stage: Getting Out through Phase 3: Retiring and Aging 


## Research Goals	
We are trying to learn the following from this research:
  · Document and prioritize any outstanding usability concerns with AVA, including both inquiry submission and the authenticated dashboard.
  · Verify the implementation of new dashboard upgrades, and help SCOs and VA employees with handling caseloads in AVA. 


### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?
  · This research will advance AskVA product and streamline more upgrades in the design process. We believe our learnings will solidify a more efficient workflow for SCOs and VA employees handling cases in AVA. 

### Research questions
Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:
  · Do the recent UI upgrades (Tabs: Personal, Business) in the Dashboard make a better overall experience? 
  · Are the users (SCOs and VA employees) able to find and filter inquiries successfully and without hindrance?
  · Are users able to navigate and access inquiries regarding benefits, GI Bill faster via the new dashboard tabs?
  · Do users understand the new tabs and their functions? 

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
  · The new tab feature, released for the week Dec 10, 2021, will create much-needed views for AVA users (SCOs and VA employees) handling cases specific to GI Bill and VA Benefits. 
  · There will be less burden for users handling cases in the AVA dashboard specific to the GI Bill and Benefits inquiries.  
  · Though the business tab will create a specific view of inquiries, there is possibly a lack of understanding of how the tab appears for users. 
  · Insights provided by the participants would provide guidance on needed onboarding of the new tabs and their functionality. 


## Method	
Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design.
