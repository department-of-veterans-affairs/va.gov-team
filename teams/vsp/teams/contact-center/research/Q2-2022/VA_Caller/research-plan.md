# Research Plan for Veteran Caller User Journey, May 2022


## Background
This study is being conducted by the VSP Contact Center team and for the purpose of establishing a verified user journey for Veteran callers using the Contact Center services. [This research will be used to inform this documented user journey map.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/40967).

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following:

- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information.
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
- Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov
- Platform users can build and deploy high-quality products for Veteran


### Veteran Journey
This research sits within these stages of the Veteran Journey:
  ·  Phase 1, Life Stage: Getting Out through Phase 3: Retiring and Aging 


## Research Goals	
We are trying to learn the following from this research:
 
· Understand all pain points of Veterans that use Tier 1 Call Center systems for their needs
· Discover insights and task blockers for Veterans that have their service calls routed from Tier 1 to Tier 2 
· Discover insights regarding Tier 1 service teams using VA tools Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics and Ask VA (AVA) to interface with Veterans and/or their beneficaries. 



### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?
  · This research will advance AskVA product and streamline more upgrades in the design process. We believe our learnings will solidify a more efficient workflow for SCOs and VA employees handling cases in AVA. 

### Research questions
Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:

For Veterans  
 · For your primary VA needs, what steps do you take to reach a VA offical and/or call center?
 · What have been blockers/ difficulties in getting services through your VA call center? 
 · Which kind of communication do you rely on the most (phone, email, SMS, assistance with aide, or other)? 
 · When recieving a resolution for your case, did you feel that you had the answer/resources for your inquiry? Yes, No? Please explain
 · Please describe your overall experience when communicating with a VA call center in the beginning of your inquiry? 
 · Did you understand the timeframe in which you recieved an overall resolution to your inquiry? 


For Tier 1 Call Center Teams
 · How many calls do you go through in the following time periods (day, week, month)?
 · When in communication with the Veteran, how do you determine if their issue can resolved within the first 10 minutes? 
 · When in communication with the Veteran, what are obstacles for you when trying to record their issue? (Can you please walk me through examples without any PII?)
 · When in communication with the Veteran, do you not technical challenges (remote access, low-tech capabilities, phone only etc) the Veteran may face during their service time? Please explain 
 · When in communication with the Veteran, how do you close their case or reroute to Tier 2? 
 · When in communication with the Veteran, what are overall blockers for you in trying to determine a resolution?
