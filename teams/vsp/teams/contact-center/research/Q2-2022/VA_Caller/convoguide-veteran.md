## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [ Michael, from the Platform Contact Center team] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your past work using the VA Hotline and the VA Call Center services

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [30-40 mins].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not using this information for any case managment. We just want to improve VA services to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

- Do you have any questions for me or any other feedback you would like to share? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 -2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on better services for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Exit Strategy (applicable if needed)

Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.

Blame technology: I am so sorry, but I just learned that the Zoom recording is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.

Backup Moderator: This is best to practice beforehand, but can work if there is an emergency with the moderator. Appoint another team member who will be on the call as the backup moderator. You can say “for the next part of this session [backup moderator name] will moderate.” They should be prepared to jump in if something happens to you or you are not comfortable to finish the session.
