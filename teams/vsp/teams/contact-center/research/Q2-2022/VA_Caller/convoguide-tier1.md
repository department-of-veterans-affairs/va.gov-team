## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [ Michael, from the Platform Contact Center team] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about [new AVA Dashboard business and personal tabs]. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [30-40 mins].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **We will be discussing, your workflow at the Tier 1 call center along with insights into case management .** 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record this session as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Main Questions: [Locating (Business/Personal Tabs)] - 30-40 minutes

· When in communication with the Veteran, how do you determine if their issue can resolved within the first 10 minutes?

· When in communication with the Veteran, what are obstacles for you when trying to record their issue? (Can you please walk me through examples without any PII?)

· When in communication with the Veteran, do you not technical challenges (remote access, low-tech capabilities, phone only etc) the Veteran may face during their service time? Please explain

· When in communication with the Veteran, how do you close their case or reroute to Tier 2?

· When in communication with the Veteran, what are overall blockers for you in trying to determine a resolution?

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we thank you for your work  for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session?
