### Introduction

The Insights and Analytics Team published a contact center report for October 2019. This was the first contact center report available since the 
launch of VA.gov and featured a compilation of data from a variety of contact centers. As part of this effort, we reached out to DEPO 
stakeholders for feedback that will be incorporated into future published reports. We asked DEPO members for feedback and asked the 
following questions:

1. Did you find this report helpful?
2. What are you going to do with the information in this report?
3. Is there feedback you would like to provide to improve this report? 

### Summary of Feedback

We received feedback from five individuals in addition to ad hoc advice over slack and conversations. 

#### Did you find this report helpful?
Of the five respondents, four of them said yes, the report was helpful. One individual said the report was somewhat helpful.

#### What are you going to do with the information in this report?
  * *Won't be taking direct action as a result of the report. Rather, will use it to gain some contextual knowledge about how the contact center organizes feedback.*
  * *I will be keeping an eye out for pain points from users and, if possible, the contact-center reps. Our team always has an eye out for process improvements.*
  * *Feedback to PMs on content and product improvements / new product ideas; Feedback to help desk when appropriate to better assist Veterans; 
  Use data to support / defend the work we do (and choose not to do)*
  * *There was only one bit of feedback relevant to Facility Locator but it was timely in that we are in the process of redesigning the UX. I made sure the team 
  was aware of the feedback that was received and added it to a document in Github.*  

#### Is there feedback you would like to provide to improve this report?
  * *Not at this time....excited to see where this goes. Thank you!*
  * *Would be valuable to know how many issues were resolved (vs. just closed or xfer’ed); Once the other help desks are added, it would be valuable to have a roll-up of “like items” 
  (so that we don’t need to go across all tabs to see the # of claims issues, or login issues, etc.); I love to sort in Excel (e.g., what are the top 5 issues?) but can’t do it in 
  this format, with merged cells and subtotals.*
  * *Not at this time. I’ll let you know if something comes to mind.*
  * *The insights offered are pretty helpful but because it depicts a relatively short period of time i.e. a month, it's difficult to understand where these data points fit in a larger narrative. 
  Perhaps indicating a "this time last year"-type data point or "monthly average" would help. Also, this is helpful high-level data, but doesn't provide deeper insight into what actually triggered the call. 
  For example, we see 28 Tier 1 Account creation/sign in issues, but I'm not sure what those entail. Maybe that info is shared another way?*
  
  #### Additional Feedback and Observations
  * In general, people were confused by some of the formatting of the report. We used excel grouping so information could be hidden. This is a feature 
    that isn't used very often so people did not find it intuitive to click on the plus signs to reveal the hidden information.
  * People also asked about definitions of the terms used throughout the report. We did have notes with definitions attached to the cells with phrases or words that we thought
    might need some clarification. But people still reached out to ask what certain terms meant. 
  * Similarly, are there processes in place to help the helpdesk with some of these issues? For example, the single biggest item is "general 
    claim status" and I wonder if call volume can be reduced by agents letting Veterans know they can check it themselves online. 

#### Next Steps

For the next Contact Center Report, we will attempt to make the following changes:

  * We will be getting rid of the grouping because it was too confusing for the users. 
  * We will be iterating on how to show details of topics by adding sub-topics but in a way that still allows the user to use excel sort functionality.
  * Will be adding HRC contact center data and potentially White House VA Call Center Data.
