# **Contact Center Charter**



---


### **The Context**

Since the web brand consolidation launch of [VA.gov](http://va.gov/), there has not been a single contact center group dedicated to providing support to users of [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) features and tools. Instead, multiple VA contact centers provide limited customer support to address and triage technical issues facing Veterans using [VA.gov](http://va.gov/). This decentralized and disparate approach to customer support has first and foremost, resulted in a poor user experience for Veterans looking for answers to their issues. Veterans are unsure of what number to call when they experience a technical issue and are therefore regularly transferred between contact centers to find a resolution. Furthermore, without one contact center group focused on triaging [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) issues, there is no uniform process for addressing issues and escalating them to [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) technical teams for investigation and resolution. Instead of one streamlined process for handling tier 2 and tier 3 issues, multiple processes have developed to ensure compatibility with the various processes and systems used by each contact center group. Finally, without a central group handling [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) technical issues, [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) product owners and teams are not receiving comprehensive data about the issues Veterans experience while using the tools and features in development.

### **The solution**

The creation of a contact center group focused exclusively on providing customer support for [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) technical issues. The creation of such a group will address the current state of poor customer support experience, improve data reporting to [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) teams looking for customer feedback on tools and products, and provide simplified coordination between existing VA contact center groups.  

### **Problem statement(s)**

How might we improve the customer support experience for Veterans experiencing a problem or technical issue on [VA.gov](http://va.gov/)?

How might we improve the quality and reporting of customer support data from Veterans using [VA.gov](http://va.gov/)? High level problem space and user goals for this team.

## **How we work**


### **Workflow + Cadence**


#### **Stand-up**


Check in on people and product progress



*   Daily @ _11:45 a.m.–12 p.m. ET_
*   15 minutes
*   3 Question Format: 
    *   What did I do yesterday? 
    *   What will I do today? 
    *   Any impediments?

#### **Sprint Planning**


Outline work to be done this sprint in order to accomplish the team’s goals



*   1st Wednesday of every sprint _@ 12–1 p.m. ET_
*   1 hour
*   _any other notes you have_

#### **Retro**


Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, what can be improved, what questions people have, and any action items



*   _Wednesday after sprint end @ 1–2 p.m. ET_
*   30 minutes
*   _any other notes you have_

#### **Grooming**


Assess and update workload for remainder of sprint



*   1st Tuesday of every sprint _@ 2–3 p.m. ET _
*   1 hour
*   _any other notes you have_

#### **Issue Etiquette**


For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):


*   Estimate
*   Title that explains task
*   Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
*   Labels: _your team’s labels_
*   User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
*   Nested in an Epic

All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket’s last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint.


#### **Team Norms**

_Update as you see fit! These are some starter norms for you to consider:_



*   Be respectful, both online and off
*   Show your face (Webcam) at meetings/calls _(flexible)_
*   Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
*   We are flexible yet intentional in the way that we work
*   Let’s have fun and do great work!

#### **Slack**


This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.


#### 3**GitHub**

GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.


#### **General things**



*   Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
*   Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
