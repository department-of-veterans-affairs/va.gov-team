**Opportunities to Improve Contact Center Product Guides and Videos**

Known gaps and ways to address them:



*   Develop best practices doc (including what is listed below)
    *   Review any documentation we have now and utilize any existing documented or inferred best practices in new documentation
    *   Add the following items as recently discovered best practices after reviewing with our VA team lead
        *   Clickable table of contents
        *   Deep Anchor Links
            *   When a particular resource is provided to the Veteran, it would be helpful to give them a link that would take them to the correct portion of the product guide vs. them having to scroll through and find it - sometimes many pages deep.
*   Review existing documentation to ensure they align with best practices and make updates as warranted.
*   COVID-19 documentation audit 
    *   Review all existing COVID-19 documentation VA.gov has
    *   Delete any duplicate documentation
    *   Archive non-relevant/current documentation
    *   Update any documentation that is still relevant, but not current
    *   Ensure documentation aligns with best practices
