**Opportunities to Improve Contact Center Product Guides and Videos**

Known gaps and ways to address them:



*   Develop best practices doc (including what is listed below)
    *   Review any documentation we have now and utilize any existing documented or inferred best practices in new documentation
    *   Add the following items as recently discovered best practices after reviewing with our VA team lead
        *   Clickable table of contents
        *   Deep Anchor Links
            *   When a particular resource is provided to the Veteran, it would be helpful to give them a link that would take them to the correct portion of the product guide vs. them having to scroll through and find it - sometimes many pages deep.
        * Consider 508/accessibility as best practice
*   Review existing documentation to ensure they align with best practices and make updates as warranted.
    *   Consider adddressing 508/accessbility of prouct guides (retrofit)
*   Provide written and/or recorded training/recommendations/reinforcement of what types of issues should and should NOT be forwarded to us. 
    *   Also, document and communicate issues we receive with incomplete information so we can have those addressed by VEO.
