**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Purpose</span>**

This document serves to provide the location and description for resources developed and used by contact centers to train staff and for staff to reference when helping Veterans complete tasks on VA.gov. This is a starting point to determine if there are any gaps in current resources, but also to help establish guidelines and shared knowledge about where resources are stored now and moving forward.

Original copies of these resources are stored internally as described in the _VSP Resource Repos_ sections. These copies are also provided to the various contact centers via the repositories described in the _Contact Center Resource Repos_ section.
