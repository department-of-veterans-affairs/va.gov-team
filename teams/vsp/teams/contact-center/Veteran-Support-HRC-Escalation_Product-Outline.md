# Veteran Support HRC Escalations Handling Process  
_Transition from VEO Tickets_  
**Product Outline**  
_June 2025_

---

## üåü Vision / Goal

Establish a consistent, high-quality process for Veteran Support to handle escalations from HRC as the team transitions away from processing VEO tickets.

The process should improve Veteran experience, reduce friction across teams, and ensure clear accountability and communication between HRC and Veteran Support.

---

## üéØ Business Outcomes

- Improved Veteran case resolution quality and timeliness
- Clear ownership of Tier II case handling
- Reduced process confusion during HRC to Veteran Support transition
- Higher agent satisfaction (Veteran Support + HRC teams)
- Better Veteran Experience (improved handling of complex / escalated cases)

---

## üë• Stakeholders

- Veteran Support team
- HRC leadership & Tier I team
- OCTO leadership
- VEO (informal stakeholder for transition out of their queue)
- Veteran Experience Office (indirect)

## üìå High-Level User Stories

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ As a Veteran Support agent  
I want to receive escalated HRC cases in a consistent format  
So that I can quickly triage, understand, and resolve Veteran issues.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ As an HRC agent  
I want to know which types of cases to escalate to Veteran Support  
So that I escalate only the appropriate cases and improve Veteran outcomes.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ As a Veteran Support team lead  
I want to monitor the flow and quality of HRC escalations  
So that I can ensure we are meeting SLAs and delivering a good Veteran experience.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ As an HRC team lead  
I want visibility into how our escalations are being handled  
So that I can maintain accountability and continuously improve our escalation decisions.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ As an OCTO / Program Manager  
I want clear visibility into the transition of Veteran Support from VEO ticket handling to HRC escalations  
So that I can report progress to leadership and ensure this transition supports the larger Veteran Experience mission.

## üîç Hypothesis

- If we define a clear process for Veteran Support to handle escalations from HRC,  
‚Üí _then the Veteran Support team will process escalated cases more efficiently and with higher quality,_  
‚Üí leading to an improved Veteran experience and reduced operational friction across teams.

- If HRC agents are trained on appropriate case categories for escalation,  
‚Üí _then inappropriate or unnecessary escalations will decrease,_  
‚Üí improving Veteran Support efficiency and case resolution times.

- If we provide Veteran Support agents with clear intake mechanisms, training, and triage criteria,  
‚Üí _then they will handle escalations consistently,_  
‚Üí improving team satisfaction and Veteran outcomes.

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done (Epic Level)

This initiative will be considered **done** when the following are true:

- [ ] Veteran Support team has a published and validated SOP for handling HRC escalations
- [ ] Intake mechanism for HRC escalations is live and functioning as designed
- [ ] Knowledge base and training materials for Veteran Support and HRC are updated
- [ ] HRC agents are trained on which cases to escalate and how to escalate them
- [ ] Initial go-live monitoring (first 60 days) shows stable process performance with acceptable metrics:
  - % of escalations properly routed
  - % of escalations processed within SLA
  - % of escalations resolved without unnecessary bounce backs or rework
- [ ] Veteran Support team reports readiness and confidence in handling escalations
- [ ] Stakeholders (Veteran Support, HRC, OCTO leadership) agree that the process is stable and working as intended

## üìä Metrics to Track During 60-Day Monitoring Period

### üéüÔ∏è Case Intake Metrics

| Metric | Target / Notes |
|--------|----------------|
| Total # of HRC escalations received per week | Establish baseline |
| % of escalations correctly categorized (appropriate case type for escalation) | ‚â• 95% after first 4 weeks |
| % of escalations rejected or sent back due to poor case quality | ‚â§ 5% after first 4 weeks |

### ‚è≥ Case Handling Metrics

| Metric | Target / Notes |
|--------|----------------|
| Average time to triage new HRC escalations | ‚â§ 1 business day |
| % of escalations processed within SLA (resolution SLA ‚Äî to be defined with team) | ‚â• 90% compliance |
| % of escalations requiring multiple team handoffs (bounce backs) | ‚â§ 10% |

### ‚≠ê Quality & Satisfaction Metrics

| Metric | Target / Notes |
|--------|----------------|
| % of cases with complete required artifacts at intake | ‚â• 95% |
| % of cases where Veteran feedback is positive (if measurable via Medallia or CSAT) | ‚â• baseline |
| Agent satisfaction with new process (via pulse survey at week 4 and week 8) | ‚â• 80% satisfaction |

## üìù Recommended Weekly Monitoring Rhythm

| Week | Activity |
|------|----------|
| Week 1-2 | Daily light monitoring, team feedback collection |
| Week 3-4 | Weekly review meeting with Veteran Support and HRC leads |
