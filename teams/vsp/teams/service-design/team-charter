# Service Design Team Charter



## Why we're here

### North Star:

Enable VA to build digital tools at scale that work for Veterans and their families.

### Team Mission Statement:

Provide holistic, research-based guidance on VSP design and product decisions to ensure VFS teams have the systems, tools, processes, documentation, and support to create successful VA.gov products.

### Responsibilities:

Own + maintain VSP Service Blueprint overall

Prioritize areas of the blueprint that require iteration based on value and pain point analysis

Iterate on those pioritized areas, or collaborate to work into another team's sprint

Perform overarching VSP user research and work findings into implementation recommendations

Use other "listeners" (Slack, ZenHub, etc) to derive overall VSP insights and work findings into implementation recommendations

Iterate on VSP features/services based on research findings, or collaborate to work into another team's sprint

Establish and track overall VSP OKRs and KPIs, and report up to VSP Leadership

Given cross-VSP team view, identify opportunities for standardization

## How we work

### Workflow + Cadence

**Stand-up**

Check in on people and product progress

- Monday at 10am PT, Tuesday at 3pm PT, Wednesday and Friday at 11:30am PT, Thursday at 10am PT
- 15 min
- 3 Question Format: What I did yesterday? What will I do today? Any impediments?

**Sprint Planning**

Outline work to be done this sprint in order to accomplish the team's goals

- 1st Wednesday of every sprint at 1:30pm PT
- 1 hour
- Discuss sprint objectives

**Retro**

Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, what can be improved, what questions people have, and any action items

- 1st Wednesday of every sprint at 10am PT
- 30 min

**Grooming**

Assess and update workload for remainder of sprint

- 2nd Thursday of every sprint at 1pm PT
- 1 hour

**Issue Etiquette**

For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):

- Estimate
- Title that explains task
- Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
- Labels: *your team's labels*
- User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
- Nested in an Epic

All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

**Team Norms***

*Update as you see fit! These are some starter norms for you to consider**

- Be respectful, both online and off
- Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
- Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
- We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
- Let’s have fun and do great work!

**Slack:**

This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.

**GitHub**GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.

User research: 

**General things**

- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
