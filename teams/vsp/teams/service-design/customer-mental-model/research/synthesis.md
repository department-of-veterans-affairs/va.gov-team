1. Cards with “enforcement” in the name tended to be grouped together, as opposed to being grouped in with their corresponding practice area.

1. There were 4 categories that came up for 5 or more respondents, with a common set of cards in them (see [Platform Cart Sort readout](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HwlXwykiBJ2XC7zXlp9YsBr39WsXT4USr88v46nYv7w/edit#slide=id.g94451db3d0_0_25) for details)
1. The category labels provided some great some hints at the type of language we can do further research to explore using: like Users & Security instead of Identity, or like Standards, or Governance instead of Enforcement
