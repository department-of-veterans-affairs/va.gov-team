## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kavitha and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about using the burial benefits form and more specifically the review page.
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**  We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
- **If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**
*Start recording.* 
- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?


## Warm-up Questions - 5 - 10 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- What VA forms have you filled out in the past? Do you remember how long it took?
- What device do you use to fill out the forms? On your phone, computer, etc.?
- Typically, who fills out the forms? (You or does someone else help you fill the forms?)
- Talk to me about when and how you usually verify information before submitting the form?
- Please talk to me about your experience editing or correcting any entry on this page? 

## Help the participant screenshare and open the prototype

## First Task: Walk through the form - 5 minutes

We are going to be looking at the burial benefits form today. I would like you to pretend that you are applying burial benefits for a Veteran who has passed away. Imagine that you have already filled out all the necessary information. Take a minute to look at this page and click on "Start your application without signing in" option at the bottom of this page.  

## Second Task: Review page design feedback (30minutes)

**Existing design**

*As I mentioned earlier, we are pretending that you have filled out all the information and you arrived at this page. Please take a couple of minutes to look at this page.*

- What are you seeing here?
- What can you do from this page?
    - Can you show how you will do that?
- What information is important in this page for you?  

- Imagine that you notice an error in the spelling of your last name and you want to fix the mistake
    - How would you fix it?
    - What do you think would happen when you do that? (based on what the participant says to the previous question)
    - What would you change about this page? Why?

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
