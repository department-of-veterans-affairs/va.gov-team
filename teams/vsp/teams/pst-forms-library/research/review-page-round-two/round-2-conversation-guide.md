Intro - 5 minutes
-----------------

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Brittany and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about using the burial benefits form and more specifically the review page. Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

-  **This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**  We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
- **If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**
*Start recording.* 
- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

Warm-up Questions - 5 - 10 minutes
----------------------------------

Before we look at the website, let's start with a few warm-up questions.

-   What VA forms have you filled out in the past? Do you remember how long it took?
-   What device do you typically use to fill out the forms? On your phone, computer, etc.?
-   Generally, do you fill out VA forms yourself, or does someone else help you?
-   Talk to me about when and how you usually verify information before submitting the form.

Help the participant screenshare and open the prototype

First Task: Walk through the form - 5 - 10 minutes
--------------------------------------------------

We are going to be looking at the burial benefits form today. I would like you to imagine that you are applying for burial benefits for a Veteran who has passed away. Take a minute to look at this page and click on "Start your application without signing in" option at the bottom of this page.

Now you're on the first page of this form. I'll direct you on what data to enter in these fields.

*Step 1 of 6: Claimant Information*
First name: Susan
Middle name: [Skip]
Last name: Anthony
Suffix: [Skip]
Relationship to the Veteran: Child

Now that you've filled out this information, what would you do next?

*Step 2 of 6: Deceased Veteran information*
First name: Mary
Middle name: [Skip]
Last name: Anthony
Social Security number: 034-82-2015
VA file number: [Skip]
Date of birth: May 14, 1967
Place of birth: [Skip]

Now that you've filled out this information, what would you do next?

For the sake of this study, pretend we've gone through all the pages and entered data like this. Go ahead and select Design 1 on this list.

Second Task: Review page design feedback - 15 - 30 minutes
----------------------------------------------------------

*Design 1: Edit by section*

Please take a couple of minutes to look at this page.

-   What are you seeing here?
-   What can you do from this page?
-   Can you show how you will do that?
-   What information is important in this page for you?
-   Imagine that you notice an error in the Veteran's social security number and you want to fix the mistake:
    -   How would you fix it?
    -   What do you think would happen when you do that? (based on what the participant says to the previous question)

Imagine you need to update the Veteran's social security number from 034-82-2015 to 034-82-2022. Please show me how you would do that.

How would you get back to the review page?

Now imagine the Veteran served under another name. How would you update that information? Please show me how you would do that.

Please update the Veteran's name to:
First name: Mary
Middle Name: B
Last Name: Anthony

How would you get back to the review page?

Now imagine that you need to select a plot or interment allowance for the Veteran. How would you update that information? Please show me how you would do that.

Please update the Benefits Selection to include both a Burial Allowance and a Plot or interment allowance.

-   When you select Plot or interment allowance, what happens? What do you think you need to do next?

What would you do next?

Place of burial or deceased Veteran's remains: Washington, DC
Was the veteran buried in a national cemetery, or one owned by the federal government? Yes
Did a federal/state government or the Veteran's employer contribute to the burial? (Not including employer life insurance) Yes

Please go back to the review page.
