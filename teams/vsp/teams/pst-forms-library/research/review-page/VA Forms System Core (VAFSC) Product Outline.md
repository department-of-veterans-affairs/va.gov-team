**VA Forms System Core (VAFSC)**

**Overview**

The VA Forms System Core (VAFSC) will be the successor to the current Forms Library form building tool. The VAFSC will provide form building capabilities that can be used either in whole or in part by application teams building forms on VA.gov. 

As of Q2 2022, the Forms Library team is building out a working demo of the first iteration of the VA Forms System Core. This is the first step on the path to achieving the long-term initiative of providing a tool that teams working on the platform can use to easily spin up and build forms that provide a consistent veteran user experience across the VA.gov site.

This working demo will:

- Provide the ability to stand up an unauthenticated form with basic form elements
- Include routing
- Include a first draft cut at a new Review Page pattern that reflects where we think we may be heading.
  - We are not building any significant functionality at this time that goes beyond the review page itself; e.g., maybe we code an edit link to go back to a page, but don’t do anything beyond that.
  - We may build within page functionality; e.g., an accordion that would show/hide content, if that is something included in the mockup pattern.
  - Think of this page as primarily being a visual mockup in code.

**Problem Statement**

Smooth and standardized VFS development isn’t being achieved today because of a complex, inflexible, and poorly documented forms system for VFS front end engineers and designers which results in complexity and workarounds in the VFS development process and inconsistent UX for users.

**Personas**

The primary users of the product will be VFS front end engineers building forms on the Va.gov site. Those forms are in turn used by Veterans to do things like apply for pension and education benefits, health care, and career planning.

**User Goals**

The end goal of this effort (beyond Q2 2022) is to develop a new VA Forms System Core application that allows VFS front end engineers to quickly and easily:
- Access documentation and guidance to get started
- Build a standard form
- Customize forms as needed
- Migrate an existing form into the updated experience

**Business Goals**

When completed, the VAFSC will provide a high quality, standardized form structure that will allow any VFS team working on the platform to easily spin up and build forms that provide a consistent veteran user experience across the VA.gov site.
