# Research Goals
This research will help us understand:

- Veteran's general experience around filling out VA forms
- Veteran's practices around the Review Page in VA forms
- Identify which of the three Review page design variations work best for Veterans

# Research Questions

- How Veterans use the Review Page in the forms experience by using the Burial Benefits form Review Page as an example?
- What are the pain points and issues on the Review Page?
- How Veterans interact with the Review Page components? (help determine which of the design variations best suit their needs)

# Methodology 

We conducted six 1:1 semi-structured remote moderated research sessions via Zoom between May 9 - 11, 2022. 
- Participants were asked to imagine that they just filled out the Burial Benefits form and to provide feedback on the Review page to better understand their experience working with the current Review Page. 
  - Participants were asked how they would edit a wrong entry in the review page.

- Each participant saw three proposed variation (in different order) and were asked to provide feedback on the design variation. 
  - Participants were also asked how they would edit a wrong entry in that design variation. 
- Finally, each participant was asked to choose a design variation that allowed them to quickly and effeciently review information and edit any mistakes. 

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

TRUE - Veterans find it easier to quickly review all the information in the Review page with information always visible. <br>
TRUE - Veterans find it easier to edit individal data fields rather than entire sections. <br>
MAYBE TRUE - Veterans find it easier to edit any information that might need updating on the original page rather than the Review page.

# Key Findings

- 5 out of 6 Participants preferred Design Option #2 for the following reasons: 
  - Visibility of information - always visible to review
  - Edit option - ability to edit individual data fields  
- All participants preferred the Review page with the information always open so they can review the information with ease. 
- 4 out of 6 participants preferred the editing individual fields instead of entire sections to avoid editing other fields by mistake. 
- 2 out of 6 participants preferred to edit the entire section instead of individual data fields to edit entire section/multiple data fields at the same time thus saving time and effort. 
- No participant interacted with anchors in the top of the page until prompted.  However, all participants valued the ability to easily get to a section from the top of the page.

# Details of Findings 

**Finding 1**

- 5 out of 6 Participants preferred design option #2 for the following reasons
--Visibility of information - All participants preferred the Review page with the information always open so they can review the information with ease.
--Edit option - 4 out of 6 participants preferred the editing label on individual fields instead of entire sections. They believed this would help them avoid editing other fields by mistake.

> "you're going to have to review each section anyway - why not have them already open? If they're closed, people will skip the review altogether and just submit" (P4).


> "I'm old and I'd rather see all of it like it's a piece of paper" (P1).


**Finding 2**

- 2 out of the 6 participants preferred to edit the entire section instead of individual data fields.  They wanted to access/edit the entire section/multiple data fields at the same time thus saving time and effort. 


**Finding 3**

- No participant interacted with anchors in the top of the page until prompted. However, all participants valued the ability to easily get to a section from the top of the page.
- 5 out of 6 participants understood the purpose of the anchors in the top of the page. One participant was confused by the downward facing arrows. 


> "An arrow pointing down makes me think it’s simply to scroll down to get to that section… If the arrow was turned 90 degrees to face right, I would assume it was interactable" (P1).


# Additional Insights

- All participants were unsure if their family would have access to their military history information that is required to fill out the burial benefits form.
- 3 out of the 6 participants expected for certain sections of the burial benefits form to be auto-filled based on Social Security Number or with the help of VA assistance.
- One participant said they would prefer a bigger font size for better readability.

> "A child shouldn't need to supply the military history and benefits information. I am unsure whether the military history and benefits information is supplied by the VA or entered by the claimant" (P6).

# Next Steps

- Engineers will create a visual prototype of the Review page pattern based on Design #3. Although this was not the most preferred design, we want to use this more common pattern as a baseline for further testing with the more experimental Design #2.
 

# Further research needed

- Further usability research with Veterans to get feedback on desktop designs, accessibility issues and the new edit design.
