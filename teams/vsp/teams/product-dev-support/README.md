The Product Support team is iterating on an orientation process for new teams that are working on VA.gov. This folder includes research, planning, and decision documents related to that effort.

Note: Slide decks for VSP Orientation are typically created and updated in an Oddball Google Drive directory. If you need access, ask a team member in the #vsp-product-support Slack channel.
