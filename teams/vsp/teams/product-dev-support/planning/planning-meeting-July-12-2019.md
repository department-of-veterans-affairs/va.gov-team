## Notes
By Light will be working on opting in/out of text message notifications
SMS notifications for VHA appointments (that's the only type of notification that exists at VA currently)

Was there research done on the IA to determine the best spot?
- No but let's get it out and test it
- Want to avoid long discussions about where things go in the profile
- Research is in scope for this
- Clarice will be running it most likely, possibly with Jeff's help
- Clarice is a Presidential Innovation Fellow, will be running the project with By Light
- Plans for them to join Slack

- Protocol for adding teams to Slack:
    - Preference to happen as far as Product Support
    - We can make requests on behalf of VFS teams
    
- They could or may start on Monday
- Recommendation in welcome email: Let's say when we want to schedule the onboarding meeting
- In the future, the PM of the Product Support team will facilitate the onboarding meeting

### Team makeup

### Where should the internal documents about working with VFS teams live?
- Maybe va.gov-team-sensitive is not the best place because that is still open to VFS teams but private to the public
- What is the justification for it to be private?
    - Points of contact (names, emails, Slack handles)
    - Other team info should be in the public repos
    - First name, last initial can be used in docs in the public repos
    - Maybe use github handles? They are public
    - Where do we store the link to their questionnaire answers?

#### Decisions:
 - Let's store the Product Support team's working documents in the va.gov-team Product Support team folder
 - Let's use team member first names if we need to refer to them

- We don't have to dictate how they run project management (using Zenhub)
- We do need them to be able to write tickets for reviews, PR templates

Product development checklist language vs. launch criteria/launch checklist.
Let's test this language.
Hypothesis: Product Development checklist implies more integration of all the things on the checklist

Launch reviews: Each team will figure out the right protocol for getting input throughout the process

Analytics:
Set the expectation that we will work with them to track success and set up the right code to track data and reporting
