## Overview
We have created documentation and examples so teams can run accessibility tests earlier in the software development cycle, and more often.

## Problem Statement
We want teams to to conduct accessibility tests far ahead of the formal staging accessibility review. This will help them ship more accessible products, and help accessibility specialists be more focused during the review process.

Teams will be empowered and confident in their ability to test early and test often. They will be able to identify low-level defects and eliminate them before the accessibility specialist begins a formal review.
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Fewer defects found in the staging accessibility review
- Reduce or eliminate any launch-blocking issues
- Increase team and individual awareness of how different issues present in interfaces or code

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Launches being delayed because of `508-severity-0` or `508-severity-1` issues


## Desired Business Outcomes

- VSP can scale up the amount of teams we support without overwhelming our accessibility specialist

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- VSP can't keep up with the demand of accessibility reviews as we scale up the amount of teams we support
- VFS teams have to delay launches because high-severity issues were not caught early enough in the development cycle

## Assumptions
- VFS teams will adop the early testing process
- Each VFS team will have one or more "champions" for this process
- VFS teams will approach the product support team and accessibility specialist with questions or need for training

## Solution Approach

- We have built a test plan and test cases in TestRail and Github
- We have written extensive documentation to help teams get started with accessibility testing

## KPIs
- Every new feature or product will go through this new testing process
- Measure the time for staging accessibility reviews for adherence to the two-day turnaround requirement

## Go-to-market Strategy
- Announce it in #vfs-all-teams before TOTs on 3/17
- As teams go through collaboration cycle, they will be reminded that it's an artifact they need to provide before staging review.

## Target Launch Date
- Launch date: 3/17
