## Overview
We'll be creating the helpers and examples of e2e tests for keyboard users that VFS teams need to add to while building their own features. 

## Problem Statement
*In a couple of sentences, describe the Who, What, Why, and Where of the challenge / pain point you seek to address. [Here's a sample problem statement definition activity you can try on your team to help generate this](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/problem-framing)*

As we scale up the number of VFS teams that VSP is supporting, we can't solely rely on manual accessibility testing done by VSP's accessibility expert. This puts a tool in the hands of VFS teams to make sure their feature/product is keyboard accessible and reduces the manual accessibility testing done by VSP. 

*Follow your problem description up with a "How might we... _______" statement re-framing that challenge as an opportunity. Don't hint too much at what the solution might be, you should have enough of a focal point here to guide your ideas, but plenty of freedom to think laterally and innovatively as you experiment and prototype later.*

We will build the foundation of a suite of e2e tests for keyboard users that VFS teams will be expected to build upon with every new feature and product they build. Longterm, this will create a solid smoke test for keyboard users across VA.gov that should run every time new code is merged. 
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- VA.gov is more accessible for keyboard and screen reader users
- VFS teams are building accessibility e2e tests with every feature/product
- Increase testing of hidden or secondary content

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Users that rely on screen readers and their keyboards to navigate struggle to use features of VA.gov

## Desired Business Outcomes

- VSP can scale up the amount of teams we support without overwhelming our accessibility specialist

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- VSP can't keep up with the demand of accessibility reviews as we scale up the amount of teams we support

## Assumptions
- Teams will build upon this suite every time they build a new feature/product

## Solution Approach

We're going to build helpers to assist VFS teams with building their own keyboard e2e tests. We're also building out examples of keyboard e2e tests for teams to use as a blue print to build their own -- and so they know where to add their own tests. [

## KPIs
- Every new feature is going through the collaboration cycle now and at the staging review is required to provide their accessibility test plan/results -- part of that artifact is including the e2e tests for review.

## Go-to-market Strategy
- Announce it in [#vfs-all-teams](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/vfs-all-teams) before TOTs on 3/17 or 3/24. 
- As teams go through collaboration cycle, they will be reminded that it's an artifact they need to provide before staging review. 

## Target Launch Date
- Launch date: 3/17 or 3/24
- A month after launch we will follow up with teams to check adoption rates
