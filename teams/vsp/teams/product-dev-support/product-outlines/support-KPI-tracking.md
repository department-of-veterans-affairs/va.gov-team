# Customer Support Tracking Product Outline 
---

## Overview
Currently, we don't have a good way to categorize or gather data about support requests. We've started using a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bKUfJ6GSRm7_Zal88IkYEiw5md-9L9WRxK51ZNMtt8k/edit?pli=1#gid=1793382735) to capture this data to help inform future decisions around team's capacity and roadmaps. 

## Problem Statement
Without better understanding how VSP teams' time is spent on customer support work, we don't know what areas we could focus on to make improvements - such as writing documentation - that allow VFS teams to figure out their own answers or get unblocked without needing assistance from VSP.

If we had a standardized way to log customer support requests and all customer-facing VSP teams logged every support request using that process, we could use that data to identify roadmap initiatives that would give VFS teams the documentation and tools they need to successfully do their work without engaging with VSP.


## Desired User Outcomes
- The process for inputting a support request is easy enough that VSP or VFS folks do it 95% of the time
- The value in taking the time to log support requests is clear
- VFS teams can more easily resolve their own issues

## Undesired User Outcomes
- The process we create isn't so hard that VSP or VFS folks don't input support requests

## Desired Business Outcomes
 
- VSP can use this aggregation of support inicidents to identify areas where we need more or clearer documentation written.
- VSP can understand how to more effectively and effectively support VFS requests
- VSP can use this aggregation of support incidents to define and prioritize development projects
- VSP can use this aggregation of support incidents to identify areas where we need more automation

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- We don't use this to analyze data (like we didn't with the zenhub epic) and folks stop logging support requests.
- VSP spends more time logging issues than supporting VFS teams
- VSP is frustrated with logging issues and stops tracking issues

## Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### KPIs
- % of customer support requests that are logged with standardized labels and fields
- % of responses to customer support requests that are automated
- time it takes to compile customer support reports

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

### OKRs
- VSP Q3 2020 Objective: All Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for VSP teams are measured and shared openly across VSP teams and with VA/DEPO.
- KR: 100% VSP KPIs are published on a public dashboard

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

## KPIs
- *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*

## Go-to-market Strategy
- *How are Veterans and others using this product going to know it exists?*
- *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful?*

## Target Launch Date
- *What is your target launch date of your MVP/iteration?*
- *What is your date for when you'll evaluate impact after launch?*
