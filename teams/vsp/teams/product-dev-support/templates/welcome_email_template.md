# VSP orientation welcome email template
Subject: Welcome to VA.gov! Let’s get started.

Welcome to VA.gov! My name is ______, and I'm a ______ on VA.gov's Product Support team. I'll be your main point of contact during your VSP orientation experience. 

My team, Product Support, is part of VA.gov's platform team, also known as VSP or Veteran Services Platform. Our main goal is to provide you with tools and guidance to build the best possible web experience for our country’s Veterans. We’re happy to have you contributing to the project and are looking forward to working with you.

As you develop your application, we’ll be your support team helping you through the VA.gov ecosystem, best practices, and processes - including the iterative cycle of ideation and strategy, user testing, launching code, and measuring results. In the next few days, we’ll meet with you to go over all the resources you’ll need as you develop on VA.gov.

We’re constantly iterating on our VSP tooling and processes to best serve you. This means we’ll be trying out new ideas with you from time to time and always love feedback on what you like, what’s confusing, and what’s missing.

Here’s how to get started:
