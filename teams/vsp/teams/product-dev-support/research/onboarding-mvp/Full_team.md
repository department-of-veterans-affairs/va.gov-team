### Wrap up
Michael T: I noticed that there are a lot of Slack channels. How do you know which ones to join? It seems overwhelming.

Emily: I would stick to the ones that related to your practice area. There are a lot of product ones as well, which make the list very long. 

Michael T: So, when I get the slides, I will know which ones to join?

Emily: Yes.

Clarice: For walking through scenarios, we were going to go through that next week after onboarding. We can jump to that early next week and understand what we're building and how we will bring it to life.

Emily: It might make sense to hold off on the discovery workshop until you present that.

Clarice: I would love to shadow or be present during other onboarding meetings.

Emily: I will add you to that.

---

Bill: I noticed someone missing from the meeting and the invite. I don't see Barry. I need to get that to the organizer so that we can include him.

Sent Barry's email. We will add him to the engineering invite.

Bill coordinates with Michael to meet before Engineering Onboarding meeting tomorrow.

Brittany: Can I set up on Windows?

Bill: (Missed first part.) Most people use Macs, so most of the documentation is geared toward Macs. It's difficult to get set up on Windows. 

Dorothy: You can stand up a virtual linux pretty easily. I'll get you the documentation

Bill: Are most of you on Windows?

Michael: Windows 10
