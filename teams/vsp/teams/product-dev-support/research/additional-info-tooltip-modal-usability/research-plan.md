# Research Plan for [VSP Product Support, VA Design System]

## Goals
**1. What product & team are you doing this research for?**   
Design System & Product Support Team 

**2. Background:**  
[Learn more button exploration ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/1817 "Learn more button exploration ticket")

The GI Bill Comparison Tool® has an open issue where Learn more buttons are [interfering with screen reader behavior](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/1251 "interfering with screen reader behavior") on input labels. This lead to a bit more exploration into buttons in labels and legends to understand how they affected screen readers. In other places on VA.gov, the Learn more button uses the [additional info pattern](https://design.va.gov/components/additional-info "additional info pattern"). We want to standardize the additional info pattern in all places and ensure that the way it’s coded is effective for screen readers, and test if a tooltip pattern would be effective for the shortest of explainers. 

**3. Research questions:**  
- Which pattern is most effective at communicating contextual information to users: Tooltip, accordion, or modal?
- Which pattern is the least disruptive?
- Which pattern is most effective for users with assistive devices?
- Are users finding the information they need? 

**4. Hypothesis:**  
The additional info pattern is the best way to communicate to a user how to learn more about a certain topic. We feel it’s more effective than a modal because you don’t have to remember what was in the modal when you close it. The additional info component stays open until the user wants to close it, which will allow them to reference its information while they make the form selection.

## Method
**1.	What method of research are you planning?**    
Remote, moderated usability testing with a low-fidelity prototype in codepen (for the accordion and tool tip components) and a [developed pattern in staging](https://staging.va.gov/gi-bill-comparison-tool/ "developed pattern in staging"). (for the modal component). We want to compare the accordion, modal, and tooltip patterns.
  
**2.	Why this method?**   
Working in low-fidelity is low stakes and we think this is the fastest, most efficient way to get answers. Remote testing will allow us to talk to Veterans from all over the country, including those who use assistive devices. We would like to moderate the sessions so that we have the opportunity to observe participants’ behavior live and ask follow-up questions with them directly as needed.

**3.	Where are you planning to do your research?**   
Remotely using Zoom.

**4.	What will you be testing?**   
- [Public Codepen demo](https://codepen.io/tpierce_402/full/PoYVKKa "Public Codepen demo") for the tooltip and additional info patterns  
- [Modal pattern live on staging](https://staging.va.gov/gi-bill-comparison-tool/)

**5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)**  
Zoom

## Participants and Recruitment
**1. Participant criteria:**  
- At least one participant should be a woman
- Representation from all branches of the military
- At least one participant should be in the 20-30 age range
- At least one participant should be in the 60-80 age range
- At least 2 participants should primarily use a screenreader to navigate websites
- At least 2 participants should use the keyboard to magnify their screen when navigating websites
- 6 people total


**2. What is your recruitment strategy?**  
We plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract

## When? 
**1. Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research?** 
11/14-11/26

**2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready?**   
Testing materials are ready

**3. Length of Sessions:**   
30 minutes 

**4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled?**  
Crystabel and Emily’s availability: 
- 11/14 9:00 AM-12:00 PM
- 11/15 9 AM-11:30AM & 3-5PM
- 11/18 9-11:30 AM and 2-5PM

- 11/26 10:30 AM-1:00 PM

**5.	Pilot:**   
We will schedule a pilot test for Tuesday 11/12. Time TBD. Emily will moderate and Trevor will be the test user. We may learn from the pilot that we need to have more time blocked off for the sessions.
