# GitHub Repo Best Practices
Determine where your file should go and how to name them...

## Folder and Markdown File Naming
- lower case words separated by dashes
- do not use spaces or special characters (i.e. &, :, %, etc.)
- omit unnecessary words (i.e. the, a, and, etc.) when it makes sense
- If multiple versions of a file exist, name consistently and include versioning info (i.e. date, v1, etc) at the end of the file name
- uploaded document names do not need adhere to the above conventions  

## Public versus Private
- see guidelines on public versus private (insert link)

## Large Files
- need to land on some guidelines and how to handle with Andrew and leadership team

## Platform, Products and Teams oh my! (Where Does My File Belong?)
- define each area and provide example files types

The __Platform__ area is maintained by the VSP team.  It is an introduction and a guidepost for VFS teams who are building on VSP, providing information on policies and best practices, as well as an overview of VSP practice areas and contacts>

The __Products__ area is maintained jointly by the VSP team and VFS teams.  Here you will find documentation regarding exisiting VA.gov products as well as a repository for new product documentation developed by VFS teams.  

The __Teams__ area is maintained by the respective VFS teams with VSP team oversight.  Here individual teams will document team charters, objectives, schedules, and best practices. 

## When to Create Child Folders
- keep structure as flat as possible.  
- a folder must contain at least one file (titled readme.md) in order to be created in GitHub. 
- only create new folders when there are an extensive amount of files and there is clear categorization 
- use a folder's README.md file to help users find their files rather than creating more folders - read me files allow you to group things and change those groupings as your files grow and change

## Governance
*insert guidelines for periodic reviews to ensure compliance with best practices when established*

## Records Retention
