# KPI Pre-Workshop Planning

### Product Line
_For example, Platform, Global UX, etc._

- Platform

### North Star

- VSP North Star: Enable VA to build digital tools at scale that work for Veterans and their families.
- Content & IA North Star: 


### Products
_For example, Health Care Application (10-10EZ), Disablitiy Compensation Application (21-526EZ), etc._

- Documentation site (and documentation site best practices and ROE)
- Content reviews for VFS teams (and content best practices and ROE)
- IA reviews for VFS teams (and IA best practices and ROE)
- Content and IA sections of VA.gov styleguide (in collaboration with DEPO)
- VA.gov menus and navigation (?)

### High Level Objectives
_What are the objectives within your product line that your product plays into?_

_Stating this will help ensure your strategy for what to build and pain points to solve fall within the overall strategy._

- Enable VFS and VSP users to find crucial documentation resources on their own within 10 clicks or less
- Uphold content and IA standards with VFS teams without blocking their work processes
- Ensure that 100% of VFS teams with contracts ending have captured crucial documentation about how to work on their product in an accessible and findable location

### Pain Points
_What are the major user and business pain points along the entirety of the service your product is a part of?_

- Teams building on and for the platform ecosystem do not know where to find, and/or do not have access to, crucial documentation.
- Manual content and IA reviews are not scalable.
- VFS teams are not requesting reviews at appropriate times, leading to prototypes and content that are out of sync with design standards.
- Platform team members are not embedded in VFS teams, which means we're missing crucial conversations that are applicable to providing support. 

### Desired Outcomes
_What do you hope changes as a result of launching this product or feature?_

- VFS and VSP team members can find the documentation they need without searching in Slack or otherwise spending excessive time on it.
- Content and IA reviews become more of a collaborative, back and forth, less like blocking review points.
- Teams know when to request IA reviews and what information to bring to IA reviews.
- When new teams begin work on an existing product, they are able to find and access existing documentation about that product.
- Teams know where to put their documentation when it is created.

### Hypotheses
_What do you plan to do/build/create to achieve your user and business goals?_

_ex: By creating more onboarding and training content, we expect teams to be more self-sufficient after they are onboarded._

- By consolidating documentation into one public repository, we expect teams to work more self-sufficiently and more efficiently.
- By making platform's design reviews more coordinated, we expect that VFS teams will need to request fewer reviews overall. 
- By making platform's design reviews more coordinated, we expect to collaborate with VFS teams earlier in the process/we expect to catch things further upstream.
- By implementing an automated test for content or IA, we expect that VFS teams will be more self-sufficient.
- By creating an offboarding checklist and integrating each piece into the product development checklist, we expect that teams will leave more robust documentation before their contract end dates.
