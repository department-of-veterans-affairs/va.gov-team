### High Level Objectives
_What are the objectives within your product line that your product plays into?_

_Stating this will help ensure your strategy for what to build and pain points to solve fall within the overall strategy._

- Enable VFS and VSP users to find crucial documentation resources on their own within 10 clicks or less
- Uphold content and IA standards with VFS teams without blocking their work processes
- Ensure that 100% of VFS teams with contracts ending have captured crucial documentation about how to work on their product in an accessible and findable location

### Pain Points
_What are the major user and business pain points along the entirety of the service your product is a part of?_

- Teams building on and for the platform ecosystem do not know where to find, and/or do not have access to, crucial documentation.
- Manual content and IA reviews are not scalable.
- VFS teams are not requesting reviews at appropriate times, leading to prototypes and content that are out of sync with design standards.
