# VSP Content and IA Team Charter

## VSP North Star:
Enable VA to build digital tools at scale that improve Veterans’ lives.

## Team Mission:
Uphold Content and Information Architecture (IA) usability and plain language standards across VA.gov, and empower VFS Teams with the guidance, documentation, and reviews necessary for them to create content and IA in line with those standards.

## Bets this team currently contributes to:
- **Onboarding**: onboarding must focus on capacity building and expectation-setting for VFS Teams to be successful
- **Support**: support must be highly available and collaborative for VFS Teams to be successful in the short term.
- **VSP Rules of Engagement (ROE)**: we do everything organically today, but we can't learn and improve on VSP protocols if we don’t have our approaches defined and documented.
- **“Portal” (though this is a bad name)**: self-service can’t work if we don’t have an easily navigable place w/strong UX for VFS Teams to find all the information they need.

## Responsibilities:
- Define and maintain rules of engagement (ROE) for how VSP and VFS teams should collaborate.
- Keep content and IA best practice documentation up to date
- Meet regularly w/VFS teams to discuss in-progress content and IA and provide guidance.
- Be available in #vfs-platform-support to answer Content and IA related questions.
- Provide plain language content reviews for VFS Teams.
- Provide IA reviews for VFS Teams.
- Perform research and recommendations necessary to iterate on VA.gov IA as the site grows and evolves to meet user needs.

## Still TBD:
- What about VA.gov Content Owners? Who takes care of requests they submit? And do those updates need to be reviewed/approved by VSP?
- What about this ongoing review work we're doing for CMS right now? Is that supposed to be on our team, or on a VFS team?
- Long term, where does usability and evolution of VA.gov IA live? VFS or VSA? Ideally the Global UX product line under Chris J would be responsible for that, but right now the most expertise for this resides on VSP. For this reason, we include "VA.gov menus and navigation" within this team's Product Portfolio for now, but that may change long term.
- How will Platform content support and work with the vsa-global-ux team, which is fully staffed with its own content editors and writers? 
- For product launches, when an apps team is launching a new product and the global-ux team is launching new content to support that launch, where does Platform content team fit in? 

## How VSP Content Support collaborates with VFS team members:
- VFS Teams will write their own content, following the guidance and standards provided by VSP
- VFS Teams will meet regularly with VSP to provide updates on their content thoughts/approaches in order to stay on track and schedule reviews appropriately.
- VSP will provide content reviews of VFS Teams' work following the VSP content criteria and will provide feedback accordingly
- VFS Teams will update their content per the recommendations from VSP reviews
- There shouldn't be any VFS Teams onboarded onto VSP if they don't have a content person on their team. DSVA should take care of this through Intake.

## How VSP IA Support collaborates with VFS team members:
- VFS Teams will reach out to VSP to collaborate on determining URL structure and entry points for their product, per the standards and guidance provided by VSP
- VFS Teams will meet regularly with VSP to provide updates on their IA thoughts/approaches in order to stay on track and schedule reviews appropriately.
- VSP will provide IA reviews of VFS Teams' work following the VSP IA criteria and will provide feedback accordingly
- VFS Teams will update their IA per the recommendations from VSP reviews
