## How we work

### Workflow + Cadence

**Stand-up**

Check in on people and product progress
- Standup Monday and alternate Wednesday/Thursday @ 12:30 pm ET
- Slackup all other weekdays
- Yesterday/Today/Blockers

**Sprint Planning**

Outline work to be done this sprint in order to accomplish the team's goals
- Wednesday (Sprint Day 0) 2-3 pm ET

**Retro**

Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, what can be improvemed, what questions people have, and any action items
- Tuesday (Sprint Day 9) 3:45-4:30 pm ET

**Grooming**

Assess and update workload for remainder of sprint
- Completed by PM with Slack feedback given by team members

#### Issue Etiquette

VSP uses ZenHub to manage work. Use [this board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsp-5cedc9cce6e3335dc5a49fc4/board?labels=triage&repos=133843125&showPipelineDescriptions=false) to open tickets in this repo and add the `content-ia-team` label.

For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):

- Title that explains task
- Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
- Labels: _your team's labels_
- User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
- Nested in an Epic

All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

#### Team Norms

- Don't be a jerk 
- Assume best intentions
- Keep each other in the loop and look out for each other (on our own work and that of other teams)
- Be on webcam on meetings whenever possible
- Escalate the medium, not the tone
- Be respectful of each other's time — start and end meetings on time, schedule meetings strategically, and come prepared
- Recognize incremental and unseen accomplishments as valuable
- Overcommunication is key — set your Slack status or let folks know when you're busy or offline
- Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters

#### Slack:

This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.

#### GitHub

GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.

#### General things

- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
