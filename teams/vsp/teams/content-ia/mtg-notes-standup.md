## **Date:** 9/12/19<br>
**Updates & team questions from Megan:**
- Scheduling team retros
- I’m going to do Slackup earlier, is that OK? Do we want standup earlier? Do we like it at 12 pm / 3 pm for now? It looks like we’re all usually free between 12-1 pm ET on Mondays and Thursdays, and also between 1-2 pm ET on Thursdays (although is having it at different times wise? Up to us …)
- What coordination do we need to do in advance of first joint onboarding on Tuesday (for eBenefits)?

**Mikki standup:**
- Yesterday spent time in GH, many unexpected tasks. Fixing broken links in eng doc (not necessarily bc repo), helped them correct things on their files. 
- Andy L working on header/footer had suggestions for how to restructure those folders. Mikki did restructuring of that area
Got caught up on VFS support work — DIC IA needed changed. Work was done, documented! Handed to Kara. 
- Today, planning!

**Peggy standup:**
- UAT testing!! A lot of work. Met deadline last night! Logged a lot of bugs, CMS team fixed them, need to verify those fixes.
- Been attending user research sessions for VAOS. Listening in, next week I’m editing the prototype for them.

**Matt standup:**
- List of content POCs for repos are done! 
- Discovery meeting with /teams space, took info from meeting & from Nancy and built out a markdown file. That is available for review, got feedback from Mikki, do more people need to review this? What does that look like?
- How do I circulate this branch for review? 
- To whom do I circulate it? 
- What is the timeline on that?
- Best practices for repo use document, I am adding feedback
