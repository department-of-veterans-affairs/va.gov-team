# Create Web Component Pilot of the Component Library 
---

## Overview
Create a Web Component pilot of the component library

## Problem Statement
When VFS teams are creating an application it can exist in one of three different technical approaches: 

as a REACT application
as a liquid template rendered from Drupal content
a hybrid of the two

In order to have a consistent user experience, individual components in applications and content should be identical across the user experience. For example, the user interface of a simple form should not appear or behave differently in different parts of VA.gov. However we currently do not maintain a library of components that is technically agnostic, so teams building in each of the three technical approaches draw from different shared/reusable code bases. 

How might we create a technically agnostic approach to our design system and the components and patterns within it that will allow a team to build a new REACT app, new content, or hybrids without recreating components from a specific technical stack or creating more code that is unique to a single environment or application? 

*Hypothesis or Bet*

- VFS teams will be able to build more consistent applications across different technical environments
- VFS teams will break able to experiment and prototype in other technical environments (e.g. Vue.js, etc.)
- VSP will be able to maintain a single source of truth for multiple technical environments

- *With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

## Go-to-market Strategy
- *How are Veterans and others using this product going to know it exists?*
- *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful?*
