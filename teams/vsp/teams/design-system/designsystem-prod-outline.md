# Design System Product Outline

## Overview

The Design System Team mission statement is to provide simple, scalable, high quality tools and guidelines that enable teams to rapidly build and improve the Veteran facing digital applications provided by VA. 

The VA Design System is the product that enables teams to build better products faster by providing design templates, reusable components, patterns and guidelines. 

## 

## Problem Statement

- We believe that VFS teams need regular improvements to the design system documentation, tools, and shared code.
- We believe that VFS teams are not designing and building forms efficiently.
- We believe that VFS Designers are confused by inconsistencies across design system documentation, tools, and production applications.

## Personas

VFS teams 

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

* Indentify current usage of design system components 
* Indentify current usage of reusable code from form library  
* Increase adoption of components in the Design System
* Increase adoption of form patterns in the Design System
* Reduce support related to Design System 

#### Baseline KPI Values

* Number of components used on production
* Number of form patterns used on production 
* Number of Sketch library updates

---

## Assumptions

- We believe that improving consistency by identifying and communicating a “source of truth” version for components and patterns will increase the number of new or variant components launched and help us track the actual usage of components and patterns across our production applications.

## Solution Approach



- We will update and add to the Form Library with resusable code and guidelines on usage
- We will update and add to the Component Library with resusable code and guidelines on usage
- We will continuously update the Sketch Library with new design patterns
