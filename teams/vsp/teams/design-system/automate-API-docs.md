# Automate API Documentation Initiative Outline

## Overview
Automate forms library API documentation updates. Add static typing to forms library to allow teams to make changes more confidently to the forms library. Separate different functionality from a form to allows users more flexibility to building a form 


## Problem Statement
The Design System Team (DST) believes that VFS teams are not designing and building forms efficiently because there are a lot of support requests in Slack for form related design and development. We believe that improving form-related component and pattern documentation will improve the time from launch to production for form applications.

The existing Forms library is very complex as it has many configuration options. There isn’t any centralized or organized documentation with information on what options are available for a form. It is not clear what options are available because documentation does not have enough details about how features work, what the forms library is capable of and how to use the capability. Even if you know about an option, it isn’t clear what acceptable values are for these configurations. We believe that teams are redoing the same work again b/c they cannot find the forms pattern or option within a form. 



## Personas
* VFS Engineers
* VFS Designers
* Design System Team

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Grafana or other dashboards/reports where possible_

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics, if possible._

---

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

_Describe, in a few sentences and/or bullet points, what you plan to build, and how it will solve the problem. Some questions to think about:_

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

_For non-trivial technical solutions, an [engineering design doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/engineering/design-docs) should be written to deeply explain **How** this product will be built._
