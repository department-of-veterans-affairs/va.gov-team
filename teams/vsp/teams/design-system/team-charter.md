# Design System Team Charter

---

## Why we're here

### North Star:
Any team charged with building a Veteran Facing Service (VFS) has the tools to quickly design, test and build an application that builds an application that meets or improves VA’s standards of quality for the Veteran experience.  

### Product Suite: 
Design System 

### Team Mission Statement:
Provide simple, scalable, high quality tools and guidelines that enable teams to rapidly build and improve the Veteran facing digital applications provided by VA.   

### Product Portfolio:
- React Library
- Sketch Library
- design.va.gov
- Component Library 
- Forms Library 
   - Documentation 




### Responsibilities:
Design System Backlog Problem Statement
- We believe that VFS teams need regular improvements to the design system documentation, tools, and shared code.
- We know this is true because they are impatient for progress, forking components into custom code, and applying components incorrectly.
- We believe that establishing and shipping a biweekly update of components prioritized by the Design System Council will improve the speed with which VFS teams can design and develop an application without customizing and forking  common code and shared tools.

Forms Library Problem Statement
- We believe that VFS teams are not designing and building forms efficiently.
- We know this is true because there are a lot of support requests in Slack for form related design and development.
- We believe that improving form-related component and pattern documentation will improve the time from launch to production for form applications.

Source of Truth Problem Statement
- We believe that VFS Designers are confused by inconsistencies across design system documentation, tools, and production applications.
- We know this is true because design critiques are more focused on proper usage of existing components as opposed to improvements or new components that will benefit all teams.
- We believe that improving consistency by identifying and communicating a “source of truth” version for components and patterns will increase the number of new or variant components launched and help us track the actual usage of components and patterns across our production applications.

## How we work

### Workflow + Cadence

#### Stand-up
Check in on people and product progress

- Daily @ 11:30AM ET
- 15 min
- 3 Question Format: What I did yesterday? What will I do today? Any impediments?

#### Sprint Planning
Outline work to be done this sprint in order to accomplish the team's goals

- 1st Wednesday of every sprint at 2pm ET
- 1 hour
- _any other notes you have_

#### Retro
Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, what can be improvemed, what questions people have, and any action items

- 1st Wednesday of every sprint at 1:00pm ET
- 30 min
- _any other notes you have_

#### Grooming
Assess and update workload for remainder of sprint

- 2nd Thursday of every sprint at 12PM ET 
- 1 hour
- _any other notes you have_

#### Issue Etiquette
For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):

- Estimate
- Title that explains task
- Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
- Labels: _your team's labels_
- User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
- Nested in an Epic

All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

#### Team Norms

_Update as you see fit! These are some starter norms for you to consider_

- Be respectful, both online and off
- Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
- Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
- We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
- Let’s have fun and do great work!

#### Slack:

This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.

#### GitHub
GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.

#### General things
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
