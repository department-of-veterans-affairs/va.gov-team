# Web Component Pilot  
---

## Overview
Create a Web Component pilot of the component library

## Problem Statement
When VFS teams are creating an application it can exist in one of three different technical approaches: 

- as a REACT application
- as a liquid template rendered from Drupal content
- a hybrid of the two

In order to have a consistent user experience, individual components in applications and content should be identical across the user experience. For example, the user interface of a simple form should not appear or behave differently in different parts of VA.gov. However we currently do not maintain a library of components that is technically agnostic, so teams building in each of the three technical approaches draw from different shared/reusable code bases. 

How might we create a technically agnostic approach to our design system and the components and patterns within it that will allow a team to build a new REACT app, new content, or hybrids without recreating components from a specific technical stack or creating more code that is unique to a single environment or application? 

*Hypothesis or Bet*

- VFS teams will be able to build more consistent applications across different technical environments
- VFS teams will be able to experiment and prototype in other technical environments (e.g. Vue.js, etc.)
- VSP will be able to maintain a single source of truth for multiple technical environments

## Desired User Outcomes

- Create 2-3 web components that are high use components 

## Undesired User Outcomes


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Be able to decide if it would or wouldn’t be worth building more web components 

## Undesired Business Outcomes

## Measuring Success
-  Create 2-3 web components that are high use components

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* Reduced time to develop components
* Increased consistency


#### Baseline KPI Values
-  Identify 2 to 3 high use components 

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)

- Objective:
  - Key result: Create 2-3 web components that are high use components to see if that benefits work of both CMS teams and VFS teams. 
  - Key result: Be able to decide if it would or wouldn’t be worth building more web components

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*
