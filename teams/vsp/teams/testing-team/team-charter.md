## How we work

### Workflow + Cadence

#### Stand-up
Check in on people and product progress

- Whole Team (Optional attendees as available)
- Zoom: Mon/Wed/Fri @ 10:30 EST
- Slack: Tues/Thurs @ 10:30 EST
- 15 min
- 3 Question Format: What I did yesterday? What will I do today? Any impediments?

#### Sprint Planning
Outline work to be done this sprint in order to accomplish the team's goals

- Every other Wednesday at 11 am Eastern
- 1 hour
- Review sprint objectives and then plan the sprint. 

#### Retro
Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, what can be improvemed, what questions people have, and any action items

- Whole Team (Optional attendees as available)
- 1st Wednesday of every sprint @ 10:30 AM EST
- 30 min

#### Grooming
Assess and update workload for remainder of sprint

- 2nd Wednesday of every sprint
- 1 hour


#### Issue Etiquette
For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):

- Estimate
- Title that explains task
- Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
- Labels: your team's labels
- User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
- Nested in an Epic


All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

#### Team Norms

- Be respectful, both online and off
- Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
- Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
- We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
- Let’s have fun and do great work!

#### Slack:

This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication. We use the VSP-product-support channel for our team discussions. You'll also get many support requests in vfs-platform-support

#### GitHub
GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.

#### General things
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub. That should be full of groomed tickets in priority order.
