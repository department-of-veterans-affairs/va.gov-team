## How we work

### Workflow + Cadence

#### Stand-up
Check in on people and product progress

- Daily 12 PM ET
- 15 min standup, 15 min parking lot as needed
- Give updates by project

#### Sprint Planning
Outline work to be done this sprint in order to accomplish the team's goals

- 1st Wednesday of every sprint @Noon (Follows Retro)
- 1 hour

#### Retro
Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, what can be improvemed, what questions people have, and any action items

- 1st Wednesday of every sprint @ Noon
- 30 min

#### Grooming
Assess and update workload for remainder of sprint and discuss objectives for next sprint

- 2nd Thursday of every sprint
- 1 hour

#### Issue Etiquette
For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):

- Estimate
- Title that explains task
- Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
- Labels: _your team's labels_
- User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
- Nested in an Epic

All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

#### Slack:

This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.

#### GitHub
GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.

#### General things
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.

## Team Expectations & Norms

### Meetings 

- Attend standup daily at 12 pm ET
  - If you can't come to standup, let the team know in advance with your updates
  - _Tip: if you're prone to forgetting what you worked on yesterday, take notes throughout the day_
- Attend other meetings
  - FE Tools team meetings (standup, sprint planning, retro) = required
  - Stakeholder meetings (design system council, CMS meetings, meetings with other VSP PMs) = required
  - VSP meetings (all hands, demo, retro) = strongly encouraged. If you can't make it, you're expected to let another team member know.
  - Engineering meetings (VFS<> VSP and FE sync) = optional, but if you don't find these valuable let FE Tools Lead or VSP Eng Lead know! 
- Schedule meetings strategically
  - Whenever possible, stack meetings together with other meetings
  - Let PM or FE Tools Lead know if you're invited to a stakeholder meeting
- Be respectful of each others' time — start and end meetings on time and have an agenda
  
### Availability

- Flex time is great! But let folks know when you're going to be offline. _(You do not have to let the team know why.)_
  - **If you're on support,** you must be available and responsive in Slack from 11:30 - 5 pm ET. If you will be offline for more than 30 minutes within this time window, you must set your Slack status and ask someone else on the team to cover for you.
  - **If you're not on support,** you are expected to be available and responsive in Slack during "typical work hours in your time zone" ish (this is vague on purpose — if that doesn't work for you, discuss with PM or Team Lead). If you will be offline for more than 90 minutes within this window, you must set your Slack status and let the team know. 
  
### What we work on

- Product Manager is the source of truth on the team's priorities — if there are discrepencies, question, desire for discussion, or suspected miscommunication, please speak up!
- If you are getting priorities from someone other than the team PM, let the PM know

### Transparency 

- Be transparent! About what you're working on, about stakeholder interactions
- Push your branches up daily(ish) even if they're not ready for review
- Default to using public channels in Slack
  - Working in public channels will result in more noise but that is OK!
  - Use private channels as needed (better than DMs)
  - Do not criticise people in public channels 
  - If VFS team members (or other) are DMing you, ask them to move those convos to public channels (such as platform support, CMS channel, forms library channel, etc)

### How we work together

- Adhere to [Platform principles](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/policies-work-norms/platform-principles.md)
- Avoid swearing
- Default to having your webcam on whenever possible (within reason)
- Underpromise, overdeliver 
- You are responsible for managing your own time
- Speak up! — everyone's voice matters

### Support role

- [Support role instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsp/teams/tools/frontend/support-and-triage.md)
