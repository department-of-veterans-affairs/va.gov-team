# VSP Research Plan for [BE Tools, External Services, May 22, 2020]

## Goals	
1. What product [tool/service/document/process] & VSP team are you doing this research for? (VSP teams: Product Support, Content & IA, Insights & Analytics, Operations, Service Design, Front-End Tools, Back-End Tools, Identity)

The Goal of this research initiative is gain a better understanding of VFS/VSA teams pain points around integrating with External Services.  
	
2. Background: 

It has always been difficult to integrate with external services because they are not part of the platform or code base that we have control over.  They are managed by teams outside of our scope of the VSP work and often have issue with connectivity/response and are not documented to any type of standard for integration and troubleshooting purposes.

3. Research questions:

What type of issue do you run into with external services?
Are there supporting documents that help guide you through the process when you hit a road block?
What are other ways you find help to troubleshoot?

4. Hypothesis:

By understanding the root cause of the issues around external services, we can start to prioritize work within the VSP teams to reduce the time it takes a VFS/VSA team to integrate with a external service, and reduce the burden on the support roles for those VSP teams assisting.


## Method	
1. What method of research are you planning?
Directed Interviews?
These will be held remotely and will be moderated.
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	

Because we do not have a solid understanding of the pain point, we want to dive deeper into the issue to understand the root cause of the problem that is being expressed.  At this time we don't have any examples or proposed solutions to test against.  This will strictly be a fact finding mission for root cause analysis.

3.	Where are you planning to do your research?
Over Zoom

4.	What will you be testing?
Nothing will be tested.  As mentioned above, as of right now we are just trying to uncover the root cause of the pain point.

## Participants and Recruitment	

1.  Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant? (Mention: Number of participants, practice areas, VFS team, VFS product. Please keep in mind that we have a limited number of VFS teams, and we should avoid going to the same people and teams back-to-back.)
Ideally, we talk to 3 VFS engineers who have integrated their application with an external service.

2.  What is your recruitment strategy? (Usually it is a Slack message directly to the team or team members. Contact the Design Lead if you need help getting in touch with anyone.)	
Slack Message directly

## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research?
Start having conversations May 26th - 29th.

2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready?
Nothing to test, so we are ready now.

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be?
I expect that we should need no more than 30 minutes per session.

4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.) that are hopefully flexible enough to accommodate our participants' busy schedules. Keep in mind that VFS team members are also remote and live in different time zones. Try and keep research sessions during normal working hours.	


5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	

## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
**List names of people who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work**
