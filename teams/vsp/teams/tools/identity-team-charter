Issue Etiquette
For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):
•	Title that explains task
•	Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
•	Labels: your team's labels
•	User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
•	Nested in an Epic
All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.
If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint
Team Norms
•	Less Meetings + More Collaboration
•	Paired Work as much as possible
•	Come ready to share during Mid-Sprint check-ins
•	Transparency is the way to spur collaboration
o	Talk out loud in Slack (Public Threads)
o	Spin up side bar conversations as much possible
•	Stay Data Driven, Customer-Focused
Slack:
This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.
GitHub
GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.
General things
•	Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
•	Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
