## Tracking Common User Interactions
As you begin building your product, you may have questions about what types of interactions are already tracked and what might need to be customized for your product. The VSP Analytics-Insights team looks for ways to ensure very common user interactions are tracked globally. 

This resource outlines common site interactions that should not require further customization by your product team. 

_Audience for this Resource_: Product Owners and Engineers

### How are these organized in Google Analytics?
Google Analytics defines user interactions as **events**, and uses a hierarchy of Event Category, Event Action, and Event Label. To access Event tracking in the Modernized areas of VA.gov, please visit the [Top Events report in Google Analytics.](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-event-events/a50123418w177519031p184624291/_u.dateOption=last30days/)

These are the broad Event Categories you will find in Google Analytics:

- **Interactions:** The user clicks on some UI element to interact with our site but does not result in a call to a back-end system.
- **Transactions:** These represent a successful self-service action that is considered a "conversion." These should be the "end goal" actions of each VA.gov product. Using a separate category allows us to take a site-wide picture of transaction volume and trends in a simple manner.
- **Sign-on:** The user takes some action related to their profile (logging in, registering, etc.).
- **API Calls:** The front-end submits something (a form's content, etc.) on behalf of a user to the VA.gov API but does not represent a successful conversion.
- **Internal:** For tracking items of interest of the VA.gov team but not directly about external users.

### Common User Interactions
Many basic Interactions are tracked within Google Analytics. Common elements that are already configured include: 

| User's Activity | Google Analytics Event Category | Google Analytics Event Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Downloading a PDF, Spreadsheet or Image File | Interactions | Event Action begins with "PDF Downloaded - ", "Spreadsheet Downloaded - ", or "Image Downloaded" | 
| Clicks to Non-VA.gov links, including email addresses, phone numbers, and other external sites | Interactions | Event Action begins with "Outbound Link Clicked - " |
| Signing onto the Modernized tools | Sign-on | Login - vagovprod | 

#### Design System Components
There are several common navigation elements that use the [Design System components](https://design.va.gov/components). We'll continue building this library with the components and matching Google Analytics navigation elements. These elements will require additional dataLayer code within the front-end. 

[Back to Table of Contents](#Data-Dictionaries)

## Design System Component Tracking

### Context
- The design system is the central UX component repository for the VA. It can be found at https://design.va.gov/components/.
- In an effort to standardize our GTM tagging according to the design system, the Analytics and Insights team is specifying a data layer
to track the common user interaction associated with each component. 
- This data layer spec should be used unless an otherwise provided spec is given from the Analytics and Insights team.
- Not every design system component will have tracking, as some are dedicated to styling rather than user interaction with no tracking pieces.

### Goal
- Our bet is that by standardizing the data layer tracking code according to the design system components, this will help cut down
on the amount of time VFS and VSP teams spend in implementing the data layer and fast-track the time to begin collecting data.
- In addition, it will allow our team to spend more time on dashboarding and insights, as opposed to the implementation of tracking.

### Implementation Notes
- This implementation comprises of two main components: 1) the configuration of custom events within each design system copmonent to collect the relevant metadata and 2) the event listener attached to the body of VA.gov to listen for the custom events and in-turn push to the data layer to be picked up by GTM

### Sensitive Components
- The majority of design system components have been configured to push these events automatically when the components are used within the application.
- That said, there are several components that by default do **NOT** collect metadata by default due to the nature of how these components are often used for PII-related inputs, those components are: 
  - `TextInput`
  - `TextArea`
  - `NumberInput`
  - `Select`
  - `Checkbox`
  - `CheckboxGroup`
  - `RadioButton`
  - `MonthYear`
  - `Date`
- While these components have been reviewed by the VSP Identity team, it is still at the responsibility of the VFS team to conduct a security review before data collection of these components can begin.

## Tracking Form Events
For multi-step veteran forms, VFS teams can implement dataLayer events that will be pushed to Google Analytics based on a set of standard event schema. These events match settings that the Analytics-Insights team has established within Google Tag Manager. 

Before you review this document, please review [Measuring Pageviews and Events.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/analytics/google-analytics/build-process-measuring-pageviews-and-events.md)

_Audience for this Resource_: Product Owners and Engineers

### Data Dictionary for Form Events
The dataLayer events listed in the table below should populate the `event` value in the `event-goes-here` example. 

`dataLayer.push({'event': 'event-goes-here'});`

In the table where it lists \<product\>, please reference the Product prefix table in the bottom of the [Measuring Pageviews and Events documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/analytics/google-analytics/build-process-measuring-pageviews-and-events.md#event-tracking) and insert your product's prefix. If your Product area is not listed, please reach out to the Analytics-Insights team via the [Analytics-Insights GitHub Issue](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=joanneesteban%2C+bsmartin-ep%2C+jonwehausen&labels=analytics-insights%2C+analytics-request%2C+collaboration-cycle&template=analytics-implementation-and-qa-request-template.md&title=Analytics+Implementation+or+QA+Support+for+%5BProduct%5D) and also within the [#vsp-analytics](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/vsp-analytics) channel for guidance.

### Datalayer Specification

Updated 12/31/2020: 
- Removing the event for `howToWizard-hidden` as current codebase is not robust enough to trust this event with great legitimacy

## Search Events

### Context
- The following spec serves as a standardized spec for tracking search consistently across the various search touchpoints of the VA.gov, including but not limited to: 
   - Type ahead search
   - Resources and support search
   - Find Forms
   - Yellow Ribbon Search
 - This spec captures both the search and search result click tracking
 - The `'view_search_results'` event is designed to align with future initiatives which include the introduction of GA4 -- as `'view_search_results'` serves as an [automatically collected events](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9234069?hl=en).
