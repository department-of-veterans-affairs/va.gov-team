# Conversation Guide

## Moderator logistics

*Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.*

*Before the session, send out the [observer instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Request%20or%20Do%20Research/Scheduling%20and%20Running%20Sessions/howto-observer-instructions.md) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel).*

*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Amy and I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about a prototype for the Product Health Analytics dashboard. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet the needs of product owners. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record your screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start screen recording using Zoom.*

## Warm Up Questions - 5-10 minutes
* Before we start, I want to take a few minutes to ask you some questions.
* Can you tell me a little bit about what your role is? (Role at DSVA, what product do they focus on)

#### General product health questions
- What decisions would analytics data help you make?
- Once you had the data, what sort of action would you take?
- How specific are you expecting the data to be? Per product? Per form? Per page? And why is that level of detail useful?
- How often would you ideally look at analytics data? Monthly? Weekly? Daily?
- What metric is most important to you for determining the health of a product?

## First task: React to Product Health Analytics dashboard

Okay, I am going to chat you a link to a static screenshot the Product Health Analytics prototype. Can you open that link and share your screen so I can see what you see?

* Take a moment to scan this page, and walk me through this page and what you're looking at. 
    * What is the purpose of this page?
* What steps would you take next?


## Second task: Interpret product health
Go through each section of the dashboard. 
- What is this metric and what is it telling you about your product?
- What would you do with that information?

- What would you do with the Product Health Meter?
- How do you think that number is calculated?

* Are there any metrics that are unclear?
* Are there any metrics that you don't need? 
* Are there any metrics that are missing?

* Do you have any questions?


## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the dashboard and make sure it really works for users.
