### Role: 
Product manager. Disability benefits form

### Wish list: 
- Google analytics funnel
- Better way to glance inside product
- Asks for number of submission
- Average time to complete
- number of users who don’t complete

### Notifications: 
- Anomalies in data, spike or drop in submissions
- Notified by slack. Email gets lost

### Shares data: 
- Information around logins (id.me vs healthy vet vs 
- Total number of submissions
- asks person, responds to emails
- General info in a weekly analytics report. But not specific enough. Dashboard is gone. 
- it can be public 

### Deadlines: 
- Blog post came out, people want to see outcomes after. 
- Not every month, just occasionally. 

### [prototype]
- don’t know what success rate means
- What is a submission vs a successful submission (success rate definition)
- Hexagon says stop to me
- Doing well is very vague. To WHAT. 
- I’d want to see what kind of errors are coming in. The red hexagon definitely calls my attention. 
- The GI bill Faculty Profile viewed is very different. There’s not a submission. 
- Not sure what I would learn from total events and unique events. I don’t know how that translates to what you need to know about the form. 
- I think “offline vs online” I’d call it paper vs online. 
- (CSAT) I’d expect some sort of a number. And compare it against other things we’re asking about on Foresee. 
- Want to see how long it’s been since we updated something. 

### Top 5:
- Error rates
- Average latency 
- If success rate was better defined. As a total number, just not as a percentage. 
- number of forms per week that were submitted. 
- If we could get some of the paper metrics on a weekly basis
- I’d be interested in CSAT scores
- Funnel conversion, I look at it for my form. There are so many forks you can take. Hard to say it’s accurate. It’s a good indicator, but I wouldn’t say that number is true. I only say the last step, which is the most important to me. They made it all the way through, and actually submit the form. That’s the number I report out on. 

I think the tooltips are helpful

Error rates, I’d want to see where the errors are. 
After getting a percentage I want to see descriptions, and how that rolls up. Where do I need to focus my energy, what do I need to get fixed. 

Funnel conversion looking to see the end, how it breaks down in Google Analytics. 

### Versions: 
Color:
Color version is less intuitive. I had to look at definitions again to see what they mean. If it was something I got used to, it would become intuitive. I’d need to keep going back to the definitions. 

Emoji:
this doesn’t’t do anything for me, but I might not be the right generation for this. We don’t speak emoji. 

### Missing:
Tighten up definitions of what these really mean. I want to see what the goal would be. What was the actual goal. 

A weak snapshot is helpful, can you compare to multiple weeks? Does this trend over time. 

Oh look! There’s a glossary at the bottom!.
