### Role:
Product manager for digital education portfolio. Focused on the education portfolio, new-ish role. 

### Analytics access:
Would be great to have it all in one place. Problem now is that we don’t have contact center data, not as interested in the metrics like average wait time, more interested in what the calls are about. Interested in getting a sense of how things are doing through multiple channels. 
- Contact centers
- Grifana/uptime
- Google analytics. 

I use google analytics as my primary mode, unless something’s on fire. I do most of the ongoing analysis in google analytics and talking to team.

### Deadline driven:
So much is legislatively driven with timelines and deadlines. Amount of people we’re getting, how can we increase that. Where are we not maximizing this funnel. 

Hard to know what the context of the broader thing is.

### Notifications: 
I’m in the engineering channels, so I know when things are down. What would be helpful is to know when our 3rd party integration services are down, like DS logon.  

I don’t want a text or be notified if things are down. I get too many of them. Slack is fine. I keep watch on those channels. If external services could also be communicated in that way. 

### Sharing Metrics: 
Using meeting with new stakeholders to re-structure relationship. Previously relationship has been weekly or less frequently. I want to sent out a weekly blog about the product. We are going to decide on cadence and mechanism in the next week or so. Will deliver metrics on an ongoing basis. 

Would be great if it was public. Getting stakeholders to buy in is something we’d need to work on. 

### General impressions: 
Looks like an excel tool showing product health for the various different services. Indicators for performance against a given goal. Status types probably make sense with more context. 

### Missing:
GI bill comparison tool is missing. 

The gi bill comparison is our highest priority. So will the 1990. 

### Prototype:
I don’t know what that symbol is intended to convey. (Pointed to key) 

I would think that I would have to define what the thresholds are. It would be cool to be able to set them yourself. Given context and spikes and adjust. Nice not to have to request someone to do that. 

Looking to find what exactly those statuses mean. Glossary? 

Active means you can navigate to the start page. 
Oh! I didn’t see the tooltip. They’re helpful, but the laggy-ness didn’t pop them out. 

No new incidents doesn’t mean anything to me. Potentially a state we don’t see here? Maintenance is intentional. Disabled feels like we retired it. There’s no broken in this list, and I’d want to see that. Being able to get to the intro page doesn’t mean that you can submit it. What does active mean?

Question of what exactly active means in the context of the 1990. If there was trouble, I’d want to drill in. I naturally want more information, but what am I going to do with that. Nice to have. 

Maybe it’s part of the product definition. Maybe we’d be responsible for defining goals around the product that the active pulls against in google analytics. Ok, this is a different feature I’m describing. 

(Reading the glossary) 
It’s a little hard to see what’s preforming the best. What’s the definition of “best” It’s hard to quantify them against each other with the information I have here. I can see the 1990n has a higher than average rate. I don’t really need to compare the forms against each other. I am thinking if they both have issues, which one is more important to address. Prioritize if something’s going wrong. 

Offline vs online time won’t be relevant to everything. Don’t know what CSAT is. 

Deploys? Is that like the website? Unclear. I can’t imagine why I would need to know that. 

Most of these make a lot of sense. I honestly, the ones that don’t have information in them are more interesting to me. 

### Top 5:
- Unique events
- Funnel conversion
- Offline/online submissions
- Offline v online time to benefit recipient.
- CSat (depending how that one is populated) 

### Contact:
I’d go to ask you if I had a question. Ha, I’d drop it into platform support on slack or maybe git first. 

### Versions:
I like the color coding better. Both is fine, but it seems more universal. I don’t know. This just looks normal to me. The color coding makes sense to me. 

Links go to google analytics. Yeah I’d expect that. Cant think of what else I’d expect to happen. Don’t need them to be links, but don’t need them to be interactive. 

Small iconography stuff that I’m not super used to.
