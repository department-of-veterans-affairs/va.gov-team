## How we work

### Workflow + Cadence

#### Stand-up
Check in on people and product progress

- Zoom M, T, W, F @ 10:00am ET
    - 15 min
- Slack Up Th @ 10:00am ET
- 3 Question Format (based on team objectives): What did I accomplish yesterday? What will I do today? Any impediments?

#### Sprint Planning
Outline work to be done this sprint in order to accomplish the team's goals

- 1st Wednesday of every sprint @ 10:30am ET
- 1 hour

#### Retro
Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, what can be improvemed, what questions people have, and any action items

- 1st Wednesday of every sprint @ 10:00am ET
- 30 min

#### Grooming
Assess and update workload for remainder of sprint

- 2nd Wednesday of every sprint @ 10:00am ET
- 1 hour
- assess ideas for upcoming sprint

#### Issue Etiquette
For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):

- Estimate
- Title that explains task
- Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
- Labels: `Analytics-Insights`
- User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
- Nested in an Epic/Super Epic

All work should be validated as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint.

*Prioritizing*
- [Link to Priorities](https://app.mural.co/t/adhocvetsgov9623/m/adhocvetsgov9623/1585175387763/ebc0ae5ed4997ab30dd932409b12269a34bd5bce)
- Ensure that we are putting VFS teams and Veteran Facing Services first. In an effort to provide excellent customer support, reply to Slack messages within a general 2 hour time frame. This can be a threaded response, as in "We should be able to take a look tomorrow. Could you please submit this as a GH issue using this template: [link]?" [Platform Slack message with customer service message](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CJRQ85PQB/p1564606636087800).

#### Team Norms

- Be respectful, both online and off; push back, don't attack
- Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
- Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
- Take care of yourself: we are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
- Stay present: pay attention to yourself and others
- Let’s have fun and do great work!

#### Slack:

This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.

#### GitHub
GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.

#### General things
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.

#### Team Knowledge
- Google Analytics

#### Grey Areas & Questions
- (May 2020) What does VSP Analytics & Insights own in relation to the analytics that is currently owned by the other VSP teams? Our current assumption is that VSP Analytics & Insights displays data, handles most customer (VFS, storytellers, etc.) interations with data, analyzes data, and provides tracking for the products listed in this charter. However, the collection and instrumentation of the other sources of data, such as Prometheus, Speedcurve, etc., will live with and be owned by their current VSP owners. So if someone has a Speedcurve question, VSP Analytics & Insights would answer basic questions such as "is my performance too low?" but would triage further questions, particularly engineering and debuggin related questions, to the Front End Tools Team. Is this assumption correct?
