## How we work

### Workflow + Cadence

#### Stand-up
Check in on people and product progress

- Zoom M, T, W, F @ 10:00am ET
    - 15 min
- Slack Up Th @ 10:00am ET
- 3 Question Format: What did I accomplish yesterday? What will I do today? Any impediments?

#### Sprint Planning
Outline work to be done this sprint in order to accomplish the team's goals

- 1st Wednesday of every sprint @ 10:30am ET
- 1 hour

#### Retro
Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, what can be improvemed, what questions people have, and any action items

- 1st Wednesday of every sprint @ 10:00am ET

#### Grooming

- 2nd Wednesday of every sprint @ 10:00am ET

#### Issue Etiquette
For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):

- Estimate
- Title that explains task
- Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
- Labels: `Analytics-Insights`
- User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
- Nested in an Epic

All work should be validated as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

#### Team Norms

- Be respectful, both online and off; push back, don't attack
- Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
- Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
- Take care of yourself: we are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
- Stay present: pay attention to yourself and others
- Let’s have fun and do great work!

#### Slack:

This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.

#### GitHub
GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.

#### General things
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
