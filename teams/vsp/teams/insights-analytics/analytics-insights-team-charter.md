## How we work

### Workflow + Cadence
VSP serves in 2 capacities:
1. 2 Week Sprints: 
- Scrum cadence for completing and reporting VA initiatives
- Sprint Planning & Reviews are Wednesdays
- Sprint starts on Thusdays
- Sprint is completed two Tuesdays after the sprint begins
- Sprint is a total of 9 business days
2. Customer support: customer support is done through Kanban

#### Sprint Reports
Each Platform team must fill out, update, and finalize their section of a sprint report for the VA. This is how we record our work, what gets sent to the VA for accountability, and what serves as the VA's receipt of delivery work for VSP contract payment.

- updated by the product manager, Engineering Lead & delivery team to serve as a back up
- due at the end of the sprint (Tuesday)

<details>

<summary>
   Scrum Ceremonies
   </summary>
       <div>

#### Stand-up
Check in on people and product progress

- Zoom M, F @ 1pm ET
    - 15-30 min
- Slack Up T, Th @ 12pm ET

2. Tweak your Objectives copy to follow the outcomes-oriented format: We will... "[Verb] _______ so that [intended  audience] can ________."
3. Capture any good ideas that you won't be prioritizing this sprint in your ZenHub backlog and delete them from the doc
4. Capture any out of offices for the sprint

- 1st Wednesday of every sprint @12pm EST
- 30 minutes
- review headlines, dependencies/blockers
- review the sprint report to mini-demo work that was completed and answer any OCTODE questions

- [ongoing sprint review deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19Om-BBdW8yYvWLgUvtQo-QbvdjGRu3RMflHjdip4UQ4/edit)

#### Sprint Demos
_Purpose:_ OCTODE Leadership and VSP Team members aware of what Platform Product teams are working on, and to understand the ways in which our work impacts the VSP/VFS/VA.gov ecosystem.
_Audience:_ OCTODE Leadership, VSP Leadership, VSP Product Teams
_Guidelines:_ Each demo is meant to be casual and brief: just a 6 min showcase of something your team worked on over the sprint & answer the product questions.

Our team is expected to demo every sprint, and the work being shared is **not** expected to be completed work. We will need to share the presenter and presentation title with the facilitator the Monday before the end of the sprint.

</details>

#### GitHub
GitHub is the single source of truth for team collaboration work being completed. Work artifacts (anything that gets completed) should be linked or attached to Github issues to eventually be linked to the sprint report. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.

The Platform Analytics team uses 3 Github project boards to track work internally:
Kanban:
- [VSP Analytics & Insights - Tracking & Access](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/projects/20)
- [VSP Analytics & Insights - Dashboards & Reporting](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/projects/31)
Scrum:
- [VSP Analytics & Insights - Initiatives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/projects/20)

#### General things
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Extra time? Explore the "Backlog" and "Triage" columns.

#### Issue Etiquette
For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):

- Estimate
- Title that explains task
- Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
- Labels: `Analytics-Insights`
- User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
- Nested in an Epic/Initiative Epic

All work should be validated as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. **Every team member should feel empowered to create, move, and close tickets according to discussed prioritization in Scrum ceremonies.** Otherwise, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself. 

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager on the DSVA Slack and ask for help to work it into the sprint.

*Prioritizing*

- Ensure that we are putting VFS teams and Veteran Facing Services first. In an effort to provide excellent customer support, reply to Slack messages within a general 2 hour time frame. This can be a threaded response, as in "We should be able to take a look tomorrow. Could you please submit this as a GH issue using this template: [link]?" [Platform Slack message with customer service message](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CJRQ85PQB/p1564606636087800).

<details>
  <summary>Prioritization Guidelines</summary>
  
  #### Analytics Prioritization
**Prioritization**

Please see the [Customer Support Priorities tab of the RACI](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JdNPKo9y-4o2c_HaWIne2L6H310fhRn2M51e5NvHdxE/edit#gid=924280563) for reporting/dashboarding priorities of the sprint.

1. Bugs that result in data loss or security issues: 

   1. **PII is being shared**
   2. Prevents VA.gov user interaction tracking (GTM tags from running/analytics collection)
   3. Data is lost (that we cannot backdate) in Google Analytics or BigQuery

2. Customer Support requests - launch date is this sprint

   1. GTM request
   2. *KPI dashboard request*

3. Bugs that prevent data from being updated, but not lost

4. Customer Support requests

   By order of work type

   1. Launch Date - the sooner the launch date, the earlier we should be working on it
   2. Estimation - ???
   3. First-come, first-serve - If a request comes through and multiple requests for launch a few month from now come through, use first-come, first-serve

   By order of issue type

   1. GTM request - CTO's Office or Covid
   2. GTM request - VFS Product
   3. GTM request - VSP Product
   4. General Reporting Question - CTO's Office or DEPO
   5. New KPI Dashboard request
   6. General Reporting request - VFS Team
   7. KPI Dashboard iteration request

5. Additional Sprint Objectives

**Other prioritization notes:**

- Access requests should be done day of, or in the next 2-3 business days
  - Offboarding from Google Analytics & Domo
  - Access to Google Analytics
  - Access to Domo
- Background information on customer Support requests (see [PRICE exercise](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_g8qmfYd0T1IxRVj2dcF9SCXQKPBx010ahFNNucpPLI/edit?usp=chrome_omnibox&ouid=107876873085830307705), [previous Mural board]())
- Github Projects cadence
  - We use the VSP Analytics & Insights - Tracking & Access project board for all VFS customer support related to GTM implementation, Google Analytics & Domo access, and offboarding. Any issue opened with the label, `analytics-request` will be added to the project backlog.
  - We use the VSP Analytics & Insights - Dashboards & Reporting project board for all VFS customer support related to KPI dashboards, ad hoc dashboards, or any reporting or data analysis questions. **As of April 1, 2021, any customer support that falls into this project board is on pause. See [Rachael's announcement](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/DEPO/team-wide-messages/analytics-services-paused-for-infra-work.md) for more details.**
  - VSP team members will only be on GH tickets if they are currently working on them. Please remove yourself if you have completed your work on the issue.
  - As you work through an issue, please move it to the appropriate swim lane. Team members are free to close request issues themselves.
    - If you have completed an issue, and the VFS stakeholder has not responded, you may close the issue after the next Planning or Grooming cycle of the sprint.
  - New implementation or dashboard requests should be responded to by Planning or Grooming that week
- Analytics is on VSP rotational support on Slack (#vfs-platform-support). Please see the rotational schedule for scheduling information.
  - If you are on Analytics rotational support, please add the tags, `analytics`, `google analytics`, `domo`, and `google tag manager` to your Slack keywords. This allows you to be pinged 
  - The team member on rotational support should monitor the following channels for analytics questions or requests: `#vfs-platform-support`, `#vfs-analytics`, `#vsp-analytics`
  - Please see [DEPO documentation](https://vfs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~497183570/pages/594182160/Slack+Usage+Guidelines+for+Teams+on+the+Veteran+Facing+Services+Platform+VSP+Contract) on Slack usage guidelines
  - If a support request can't be completed quickly (more than 5-10 minutes), a ticket will need to be created & triaged
  - If a support request is flagged by the customer as 'urgent' (i.e. please have a report by today or tomorrow) or a customer will not move the conversation into #vfs-platform-support or fill out a Github request template, please escalate to the Product Manager or escalate to the Product Owner if the Product Manager is out of office
- If a bug or an urgent matter backs up customer service issues for the sprint, please flag the Product Manager (please flag the Product Owner if the Product Manager is out of office)
</details>

#### Team Norms

- Be respectful, both online and off; push back, don't attack
- Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
- Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
- Take care of yourself: we are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
- Stay present: pay attention to yourself and others
- Let’s have fun and do great work!

#### Slack:

This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.
