### How to Upload Demo Video to VA Youtube Channel

Product teams are required to notify the contact center team before a new feature or update will be released on VA.gov. As part of this notification 
process, the product team must provide a demo video and associated transcript. It is the responsibility of the contact center team to review the 
demo video and transcript and then request the Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs (OPIA). This is done by by emailing the video file 
along with the written transcript to both Tass Mimikos [tass.mimikos@va.gov](tass.mimikos@va.gov) and Ben Pekkanen [Ben Pekkanen](Ben.Pekkanen@va.gov).
