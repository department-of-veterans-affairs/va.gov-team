# Monthly Reporting Request Process

This document includes the history, current state, and future goals of how VSP Contact Center POCs interact with and retrieve information from external contact centers.  

This process will be clearly outlined and updated once confirmation is received from each of the contact centers that we are reaching out to.

Currenlty, many contact centers that we work with either do not provide any data at all or the data is provided intermittently.  Reporting has been requested in the past, however, there has been little to no progress.

Information is received from NCC (National Call Center) only after a POC (Chante or Kimberley) reaches out to the appropriate contact to obtain the reporting for that particular month.

The goal is to have all contact centers provide data to us that may be affected by a tool that we help support.  Retrieving reports in either CSVs, Excel, or through an API.

It has been established that the following contact centers will be contacted initially in an attempt to establish a relationship and obtain reporting on a monthly basis.  Depending on the responses, the process may be different for each center, but the goal is to have one streamlined way of receiving information from each contact center.

- NCC: National Call Center

- Education

- NCA: National Cemetery Administration

- HEC: Health Eligibility Center

- HRC: Health Resource Center
