Original escalation process of reporting from IRIS and SalesForce to the VSP teams has proven to be more chanllenging than once thought.  A different approach is now being taken by the Contact Center team.

Meeting notes from WHVAH:
- Rebecca stated that she was under the impression that there are more training materials for the agents.  If so, she would like for you to gather that information and send it over to her.
- She believes that she and her team can manage the training aspect.  She stated that the training for us would take about an entire month with the way the contact center is designed.  
  * For example, having a limited number of agents that can be off of the floor for a limited amount of time.
  * I emphasized that we are still willing and able to facilitate training.
- She has stated that by March of 2020, they should be fully functional for the Salt Lake City location.
- They are developing their FY20 roadmap which includes hiring 160 agents for the Salt Lake City location.
- She is asking that we go back and review our requirements for development for the CRM.  She states that they have recently gotten some of their requested changes incorporated and should take place in November.
- Rebecca is aware that she owes you due outs for business rules.  Currently they are outdated, so she needs to update before sending to you.
- There is a Client Relations development call that she is going to have us added to.

WHVAH will not be able to handle VA.gov issues until March 2020

## VA.gov Technical Support: The Problem
There is still no contact center that has taken on the responsibility of handling VA.gov technical issues. The White House VA Hotline (WHVAH) was identified to fulfill this role but has since been given additional responsibilities (Mission Act and Tier 1 Calls) and has deprioritized VA.gov work. Furthermore, WHVAH has not acted as collaborative partners, even prior to the addition of new business lines. Since the launch of VA.gov, this is where we stand as it relates to contact center:

## WHVAH
Conducted one training with the WHVAH on VA.gov issues. Not invited back to do any further training.
The CRM has not been updated to track our issues. 
Unable to schedule consistent meetings or achieve agreement on timelines and tasks.

## HRC
Continues to handle VA.gov calls but does not share details or data with us. We were able to finally get 4 months of tracked data, but this appears to be a one off situation.
Extreme frustration from the team because we haven’t transitioned our work to another contact center. 

## IRIS
This is our primary form of data collection. It is a manual process, a bad user experience for the veteran, and is not sustainable with only two individuals handling the issues. 

Given the current status quo of this project, we feel we need to find a new approach to establishing a contact center that will handle VA.gov technical issues by the end of the calendar year.

* Option 1: Create a formal contract/agreement with a VA.gov contact center: This would align most closely with the approach we have been taking but would force the issue of our partner agreeing to clearly defined expectations for how we work together. While it would seem to make the most sense to present this idea to the WHVAH first, HRC might be a better option given their experience with VA.gov and track record of delivery. 
  - Pros: In line with previous work, formalizes relationship and expectations
  - Cons: Agreement might not be followed or followed so closely that we don’t have space for iteration and adaptation, will come at a monetary cost, 

* Option 2: Stand up our own VA.gov contact center: This is an option that is probably the costliest and  most complicated but would enable us to have direct control over the operations and quality of the group handling VA.gov technical issues. 
  - Pros: VSP owned and operated, ensure seamless coordination across teams, make technology decisions that make sense based on our needs.
  - Cons: High cost, contributes to VA.gov contact center problem (there are too many), complicated and potentially time-consuming process, hard to pass off to VA. 

* Option 3: Build up VSP’s contact center capacity: If we continue down the current path with WHVAH, it would help to build out the number of people answering online questions through IRIS and MS Dynamics if the transition continues to be slow and uncoordinated. 
  - Pros: More robust stopgap measure that could make a difference, more data, more answered questions for veterans.
  - Cons: Not a long-term solution, means no dedicated place for a veteran to call and get help, more money than it’s worth.
