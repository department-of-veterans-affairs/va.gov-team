## Pain Points:
- Reporting to teams - takes a long time to get a response or know where they are in the process
    - Maybe it was the holidays, but the constant following up can be hard and frustrating
- With IRIS, we can’t do screen shots and it’s hard to get VFS teams all of the information that they need
- Trying to get an org sheet with all the different places that people own
- Even when it’s not the holidays, it is difficult to get consistent responses
    - This is due to the fact that VSP doesn’t have a clear process or timeline for how bugs are handled across the different teams, nor do we have a level of prioritization for issues delegated to VFS teams
- In our documentation that we currently have, we don’t have clear guidelines from VFS teams 
- We don’t have expectations to get back to Veterans on their Contact Center issues
- This isn't going to be scalable when we get access to Contact Center data outside of IRIS and Salesforce
- VFS teams might need to carve out more time during sprint planning for dealing with bugs

## Current Process
- We make Github tickets for most of the issues, so we can track when there is progress

## Ideal Scenario:
- Determining the guidelines for VFS teams to handle issues
- Ideally, for reporting issues, the tool that we use should ping us as well as teams on how long issues have been waiting
    - We need to know how long issues have been open

### Next Steps:
- Share top issues that have dependencies in ToT
- Talk to other Platform teams and go through their Github documentation on what their processes are, if any, on reporting bugs to VFS teams
