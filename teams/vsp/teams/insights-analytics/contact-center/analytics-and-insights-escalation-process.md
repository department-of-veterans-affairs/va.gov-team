Contact Center Process - Insights & Analytics Reporting
Note: This is an MVP process and we will continue to capture pain points as we test this out and learn what works well and what doesn't. It is intended to change as we discover what works best!
Step One: Discover an issue
Currently there is no automated way to relay issues from WHH to the Insights and Analytics team. 

Issues will be discovered by the Contact Center team by reviewing the daily report results from SalesForce. This report is derived from tickets that are created from the information that WHH agents have entered into SalesForce.

Once the issues have been discovered, the Contact Center team will determine if it is something that can be resolved within the Contact Center team or if it needs to be forwarded to the Insights and Analytics team.
Step Two: Relay Information to Insights & Analytics Team
From the spreadsheet information will be compiled and entered into ZenHub for investigation and ultimately resolution.


Step Three: Investigation and Prioritization
Prioritization of Contact Center issues will be determined by the insights and analytics team.

Insights and analytics will perform some initial discovery and Q&A around a reported problem to try and understand how urgent it is - how many people are likely affected, and how severely their ability to access/manage benefits is hampered.

Step Four: Resolution/Postmortem
Any and all pertinent information for resolution or next steps will be entered in the ZH ticket.
These details will be used by the Contact Center team to communicate back to the appropriate parties.
Step Five: Communicate Resolution
Resolutions will be communicated back to the customer by one of the following ways:
Direct 	contact from the Contact Center 	
 	
Contact by a WHH agent after proper resolution has been provided.


Questions:
Are there other ways a resolution can be communicated back to the customer?

Are there ways that mass issues can be communicated (ex. Blurb on website, mass email)?

Can templates be created by insights and analytics for easy explanation back to the customer?
