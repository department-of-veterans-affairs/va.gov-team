* ## Monthly Contact Center Report
Each month the Contact Center team reports ticket issue totals from IRIS and SalesForce, the breakdown of ticet issues by topic and subtopic, reported feedback, and call volume from participating contact centers.  Currently we receive call volume reporting sporadically from NCC only. 

There are two spreadsheets involved in the monthly reporting process, both located on the VA Network on theh O drive.
  - 2020 February - VA.gov.contact.center.report: This is the montly report that is presented to leadership and shared with VFS teams.  This report should be copied and 'saved as' each month and replaced with the current months name.  It is also important to update the date range in each of the six tabs that make up this report.
  - VA.gov 2020 Issues spreadsheet: This is the spreadsheet were ALL issues are entered.  This is a working spreadsheet that the Contact Center team uses on a daily basis to track IRIS and SalesForce (SF) issues.
