## Contact Center

If you are involved in a discovery sprint, one good resource is to use the contact center.  The contact center speaks with Veterans daily on problems and issues they face with vets.gov.  The best way to work with the contact center is through our DSVA Contact Center Lead Chante Lantos-Swett (Chante.LantosSwett@va.gov). 

## Office of Client Relations

The OCR is in the Secretary's Office and has existed for many years to manage high-priority issues that get raised to the Secretary's office, such as letters to the President.

In recent years, their office got really busy because Secretary Bob used to give his number out to any Veteran he would meet.  When his number started getting busy, they formed a small team to help manage Veteran's questions. Today, this team is run by Debi Bevins.  

Their office is an amazing resource because they interact with Veterans everyday and have a great understanding of specific problems and issues that Veterans face.  

If you want to reach out to Debi as part of you research, please email Natalie (natalie.moore@va.gov) with a list of questions you want to ask.
