## Issue Title: User blocked from performing activity or seeing an error message
**Description:** This is the response we provide when a user reports seeing an error message that says something went wrong or something is not available. While there are many versions of this type of situation, here are a few examples of what a user might see or say:
  * User sees the error message “We’re sorry. Something went wrong on our end, and we couldn’t sign you in.” 
  * User sees the error message “We are unable to process your request. We have been notified of the problem and will do our best to make sure it doesn't happen again!”
  * User sees the error message “We're sorry. Our system is temporarily down while we fix a few things. Please try again later.”
  * User is trying to update their address and see the error message stating they could not update their address because of problems on our end. 

**Action:** When a user sees and error message that says there is a problem on our end, this typically means this is a temporary problem that is caused by a server issue. These issues will resolve over time which is why we want to confirm with the user that the problem has been fixed. If it has not gone away, it is important to collect information so we can investigate what might be causing the problem.

Dear ________,

Thank you for your inquiry. We’re sorry you can’t access your military service records. If you think you should be able to view your service information here, please file a request to change or correct your DD214 or other military records.
Some Veterans have reported seeing military service information in their VA.gov profiles that doesn’t seem right. When this happens, it’s because there’s an error in the information we’re pulling into VA.gov from the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS).
If the military service information in your profile doesn’t look right, please call the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC). They’ll work with you to update your information in DEERS.
