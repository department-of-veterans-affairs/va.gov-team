IRIS Process Documentation
Currently, the only way to get reliable access to data on VA.gov issues is through the VA.gov IRIS group and the MS Dynamics sign in form. This is a very manual and slow process and has been put in place as a stop gap measure so the VSP team can gather data on the types of issues our users are seeing on VA.gov and provide a path for users to get answers to their technical issues. This is not a process that should be included in any long-term strategy for VA.gov call center work but will continue until we are able to have a contact center trained to answer VA.gov technical questions. 

The Contact Center that uses MS Dynamics is HRC, which we currently do not track issue with.  Unfortunately we are not privileged to that information at this time.  WHH is the main Call Center in which we are to partner with, however, their CRM is SalesForce and have had no updates since February 2019.  The CRM that WHH will use moving forward is still up for debate and we should be notified once that decision is made.

## Reviewing IRIS Issues

First, make sure you are in the “My Groups” Inbox










The Contact Center team member will review the inquiries to find trends and assign to the appropriate team, reassign to the Contact Center, or answer general inquiries .  If a trend is found, then a spreadsheet will be created including:
* Inquiry #
* Date last updated
* Subject
* Status
* ALL PII WILL BE REMOVED

In order to do this, you have to export the inquiries into an Excel spreadsheet.

Once you have selected to export into Excel, another box will appear for you to select your location and save.
Select the same options and click OK.

## Answering or Reassigning IRIS Issues

Once an issue has been found and opened, click on the “messages” tab to find the description of the issue. To send a response, click the “Add” button and select “response via email.” To send the response, select “Send on Save” and click the “Save” or “Save & Close” once finished with the response. 











- There are two main ways to respond to an issue:
  - Answer the question: Using the template response document, the Contact Center team member will copy and paste the appropriate answer and update the text if necessary.
  - Reassign the issue to a different IRIS group: If an issue is not VA.gov related, the issue should be reassigned to the correct group within the VA. This is typically VBA or VHA. To reassign the issue, go to the “Summary” tab, and choose the correct group in the “Assigned” field. 











## Tracking IRIS Issues

- The Contact Center team will provide the Triage team with a spreadsheet of new issues each day by placing it into ZH that will be reviewed, answered, and if necessary, triaged.  As each issue is responded to, the triage team member will update the spreadsheet in the following ways:
  - Status: The status column will be prepopulated with IRIS terms. If an issue receives a written response from the triage team member, that issue is considered closed and the status will be changed to “solved.” If the issue requires additional triage work, the status of the issue will be set to “escalated,” and the triage team member will send out the escalation template response to the user.  
  - Topic and Sub-Topic: After reviewing and answering an IRIS issue, the triage team member will fill in the Topic and Sub-Topic field based on the issue description. 
- If an issue is escalated, the triage team member will follow their team process for escalating the issue. 
  - Additionally, rather than saving and closing the issue in IRIS (which automatically changes the status to solved) they will update the spreadsheet in the ZH ticket changing the IRIS status to “In Progress” before saving the ticket. 
- After reviewing spreadsheet and ensuring all updates have been recorded by Triage team members, the Contact Center team member will update (close) the ZH ticket at the end of the day; notifying all assignees.  The insights and analytics team member will then compile the data for tracking and reporting purposes.
