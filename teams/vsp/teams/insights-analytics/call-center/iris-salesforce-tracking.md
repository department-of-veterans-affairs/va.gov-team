# IRIS and SalesForce Tracking

## Current State

There is now one centralized location where the Contact Center Leads can now access the master spreadsheet of IRIS and SalesForce issues.  All pertinent information from each CRM will be added to the spreadsheet.

Contact Center Leads will gather issues on a daily basis from IRIS and SalesForce and enter into the master spreadsheet located on 
the O drive of the VA Network.  

## The information that will be collected:

- Ticket numbers
- Origination ticket date
- System (i.e. IRIS or Salesforce)
- Name of employee handling issue
- Status
- Users last name
- Description/Case notes 
- Topic
- Subtopic


Once the information is entered into the master spreadsheet it will be the responsibility of the Call Center Leads to follow the escalation process in order to advise the appropriate teams of known issues.
