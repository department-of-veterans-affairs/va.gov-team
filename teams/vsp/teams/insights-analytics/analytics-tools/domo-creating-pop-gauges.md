## Creating Period-Over-Period Gauge Charts in DOMO

DOMO provides several types of [gauge charts](https://knowledge.domo.com/Welcome/Available_Chart_Types/08Available_Gauges) that we use to display individual metrics.  This can be an individual value like an aggregated average or the change to a metric over a period.

Because the BigQuery daily session tables are at least one day behind the current day, it is not possible (at the time of this writing) to use DOMO's period-over-period gauge charts as-is.  Because DOMO considers the "Last 7 days" to start at the current date - and not the most recent day in the dataset - you will end up comparings periods of 6 days to periods of 7.

We have several options to work around this limitation.

### Calculated column in DOMO dataset views

You can create a calculated column in a [DOMO dataset view](https://www.domo.com/learn/dataset-views).  Your goal is to create an output dataset that includes a grouping date column and the values you want to compare.

For instance, if you want to compare the average of a conversion rate from the last 7 days to the 7 days before that, you can create a grouping date column like:

```sql
-- Return 1 for the last 7 days and 2 for the period before that
CASE
	WHEN DATEDIFF(`date`, MAX(`date`) OVER ()) <= 0 
		AND DATEDIFF(`date`, MAX(`date`) OVER ()) >= -6 THEN 1
	WHEN DATEDIFF(`date`, MAX(`date`) OVER ()) <= -7
		AND DATEDIFF(`date`, MAX(`date`) OVER ()) >= -13 THEN 2  
END 
```

To use this in a gauge chart, create a 'Multi-value Gauge' chart and use your grouping date column as the "Optional Group By" field.

You will also need to sort by your primary date column and make sure your selected date range includes all the dates you want to compare.

### Beast Mode calculation in a card

It's a little unwieldy (especially for periods of 30 days), but adding together and dividing values in a Beast Mode does give you an accurate rolling value.

For instance, you can create a Beast Mode calculation for the last 7 days:

```sql
(`event_rate` + LAG(`event_rate`, 1) OVER (ORDER BY `date`) + LAG(`event_rate`, 2) OVER (ORDER BY `date`) + 
LAG(`event_rate`, 3) OVER (ORDER BY `date`) + LAG(`event_rate`, 4) OVER (ORDER BY `date`) + 
LAG(`event_rate`, 5) OVER (ORDER BY `date`) + LAG(`event_rate`, 6) OVER (ORDER BY `date`)) / 7
```

...and the 7 days before that...

```sql
(LAG(`event_rate`, 7) OVER (ORDER BY `date`) + + LAG(`event_rate`, 8) OVER (ORDER BY `date`) + 
LAG(`event_rate`, 9) OVER (ORDER BY `date`) + LAG(`event_rate`, 10) OVER (ORDER BY `date`) + 
LAG(`event_rate`, 11) OVER (ORDER BY `date`) + LAG(`event_rate`, 12) OVER (ORDER BY `date`) + 
LAG(`event_rate`, 13) OVER (ORDER BY `date`)) / 7
```

You can then use a "Comparative Gauge" chart to compare the two values.

You will probably want to set *General > Value Displayed*  to "Percentage Change" and "General > Value Format" to "Percentage".

You will also need to sort by your primary date column and make sure your selected date range includes all the dates you want to compare.
