# KPI Setting and Tracking

**Goal**: All VFS teams will have Key Performance Indicators set up, be supported in tracking their data, and use these metrics for data-driven product decisions and goals. 

## KPI Setting Workshops (_As a part of the initial weeks of VSP Orientation_)
1. The VSP Analytics and Insights Team (VSP Insights) will set up 2 hour workshops with teams building products or services in the VA.gov ecosystem - this includes VFS and VSP teams.
2. VSP will send the VFS Team a [link to a pre-work template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/analytics/kpi-setting-pre-workshop-template.md) before the workshop.
3. The VFS team needs to create a file from this template in their /team folder in GitHub, and meet internally to fill it out before the Workshop.
4. VSP Insights will facilitate the KPI Workshop itself, to lead teams through setting the KPIs for their product(s). Teams will collaborate in this meeting via screenshare, to fill out a [KPIs Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LGN2TKNwmobdl4yhxjyd_bua22KUkW3K56RU7yHMNrk/edit#gid=1554481611) hosted by VSP Insights.
5. Post-workshop, VSP Insights will Slack an Excel version of the Google Sheet to the team, the team will upload it to their product folder, and return the link to Insights. 

## Insights KPI Tracking (_Post Orientation_)

1. Insights will add each team's KPIs to [this list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsp/teams/insights-analytics/kpi-tracking/kpi-list.md) and consolidate them [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1No7cWp3LgD69dQWgA5bdgo0zx5d-1m-4HW-ZLnasSDM/edit#gid=0).
2. VSP Insights will synthesize the data from each team's KPI setting to track:
    - Which KPIs are the most common
    - Which data sources we can pull from for tracking KPIs
    - Which desired metrics are uncaptured
3. VSP Insights will incorporate results from KPI workshops and check-ins to the Product Health Tool.
5. VSP Insights will be readily available for team questions and updates on KPIs and product health metrics through the #vfs-platforrm-support Slack channel.

## Quarterly Check-Ins

VSP Insights will perform quarterly KPI check-ins with each team. 
    - These check-ins will incorporate the KPI results, resulting actions, and any adjustments to KPIs.
    
(_Assumption: Insights will develop and deploy the Product Health Tool, which will help minimize the load to Wrangle and Explore the data_)

1. PM Training: Teams should have already set their KPIs. Insights will workshop PMs to develop the following key data-driven product management:
    - Reviewing KPI Goals & Prioritization (Red-Yellow-Green)
        - Green: Goal
        - Yellow: Warning Zone (with time to make adjustments)
        - Red: Unacceptable Result
        - Super Green: Stretch Goal
    - Re-evaluating KPIs after obtaining actual numbers
        Attempt to answer the following questions:
        - Data interpretation: Evaluating relationships between the data and the product, and test hypotheses
        - Insights to Action: After data has been evaluated, how do to pivot your Agile roadmap and re-evaluate your KPIs
        
 2. Insights will schedule an hour-long quarterly check-in with each team's PM & Product Owner. This time should be alloted to review results, re-evaluation of KPIs, address any holes in data wrangling, and answer any analytics-related questions.
