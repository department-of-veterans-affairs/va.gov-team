## We assume positive intent
We are all here because we want to improve the lives of Veterans.  To that end, our default assumption is that everyone involved with this work has done their best to build a positive experience with what was available to them at the time.  The decisions that got us here were made by smart and capable people, and were likely influenced by forces beyond their control like legislation, policy, privacy, security, patient safety, technology, budget, or other constraints.

## Communications
### Slack
- Information on getting access to Slack and taking advantage of its features will be discussed later in our orientation material.
- Slack is the preferred communication channel for My HealtheVet teams and most teams creating applications on VA.gov and VA Health and Benefits mobile apps.
- Anything written in Slack is subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
- We encourage transparency and conversing in public channels by default.
- Personal Health Information (PHI), Personally Identifiable Information (PII), and credentials should never be shared in Slack, including private channels.  Use encrypted email or provide a link to the appropriate test user list in the GitHub sensitive repository.  If you're not sure if something qualifies as PHI or PII, ask your OCTO product or engineering lead.
- Before posting in a channel you're new to, read the channel topic and description.  Some teams ask that threads be started with a command to initiate a workflow.
- Thread conversations to reduce noise in channels üßµ
- A helpful practice for keeping channels uncluttered is to begin new threads with a short intro, then reply to your own thread to add details and collaborate.
- When making a correction, it's common practice to strike through the original information and add the new information after the stricken text.
- If an ongoing thread needs to be moved to a different channel, cross-link the two threads.
- If you're going to be out of office, update your status with the ‚ùå icon, along with an OOO note and the relevant dates.

### Email
- Conduct all VA business from your VA.gov email address.
- Email is the recommended option for initiating contact with OCC stakeholders and other VA business partners.
- Everyone working on VA.gov is expected to check their VA email regularly.  Our OCC stakeholders generally communicate with us via email, and VA policy dictates that employees are not to discuss VA business with anyone using a non-VA email address.
- Never share Personal Health Information (PHI), Personally Identifiable Information (PHI), or log in credentials in unencrypted email.  This includes screen shots in which that type of information is visible.
- Email is good for quick communications with VHA stakeholders, particularly if their response needs to be shared with the team, used as reference, or stored with project documents.  If there are a large number of questions to be answered, or discussion is required, emails often will not yield a good result.
- Know when it's time to move the conversation to a meeting. If an email thread goes beyond ~5 replies, considering scheduling a meeting and following it up with an email confirming any decisions made.

### Microsoft Teams
- Some OCC stakeholders prefer to communicate via chat in Microsoft Teams.  This is a good option for getting quick answers once you've gotten acquainted with them and have a feel for their communication preferences.
- Teams is also the platform we use for virtual meetings.  More details are provided in [_Scheduling Meetings_](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/health-products/health-portal/how-we-work.md#scheduling-meetings) below.

### Scheduling Meetings
- Schedule meetings in Microsoft Teams from your VA.gov calendar.  Zoom is no longer supported by VA and many VA staff can't access it.
- We schedule meetings to start at 5 minutes past the hour or half hour to give folks a break between back-to-back meetings. With the exception of daily scrum, avoid starting or ending meetings at 15 or 45 minutes past the hour.
- Default meetings to 30 minutes unless there is a great deal of material to cover.  In that event, schedule for an hour.
- Include an agenda, purpose, and expected outcomes in the meeting invite.
- If attendees are expected to give opinions or discuss content or other written materials, send it as a pre-read at least 24 hours before the meeting to give attendees time to look it over. 
- If someone essential to achieving your meeting objective declines, such as a key team member, subject matter expert, or decision-maker, reschedule your meeting.
- Check invitees' calendars before scheduling to ensure they they are available. If you can't find a time that works for everyone, ask before booking over an existing meeting.
- When scheduling recurring meetings, check your attendees's calendars for the whole month to avoid conflicts with meetings that only occur once or twice per month.
- If you have a large number of attendees, send out some possible dates/times and ask people when they are available.  For senior leaders, work with their executive assistant.
- We have team members in all US time zones, so avoid scheduling meetings before 11 AM or after 5 PM ET.
- Avoid scheduling meetings on Fridays as many VA employees work compressed schedules and are off every other Friday.
- Standing meeting times to avoid:
    - VFS All Teams / OCTO Health Monthly Portfolio Review: Tuesdays 12-1 PM ET
    - Tech Tuesday/MHV Patient Health Record Policy Group meetings: Tuesdays at 2 PM ET
    - MHV Weekly Standup: Wednesdays 11:30 - noon ET
    - OCTO All Hands: Thursdays 12-1 PM ET
    - OCTO Health Portfolio All Hands: Tuesdays 1:30 PM
  - A list of meetings you should attend will be provided later in our orientation documents.

## Project Methodology
- We follow Agile Scrum methodology and hold the standard scrum ceremonies (sprint planning, daily standup, backlog refinement, sprint demo and retrospective).
- Schedule TBD

## Documentation
- Document storage specifics for your area of practice will be discussed later in our orientation materials.  As a general rule, we store project documents in GitHub and SharePoint.   Documentation should never be stored in Google Drive, DropBox, or other systems not approved or accessible by VA.
- Never store PHI, PII, or credentails in public repositories.
