# My HealtheVet - Orientation Checklist for Lauren Cutrell, Product Manager for the Platform and API Messaging team

Hi Lauren, and welcome to the My HealtheVet portal team.  We're glad you're here!

We've created this orientation checklist to help you learn about our team, what we do, and how we work.  If you are new to this program, we recognize that you won't be able to access some systems and documents right away, so we've organized our orientation to focus on publicly-available information first.  Once you've got your VA email and access to the VA network, you'll be ready to really dig in.

## VA Platform orientation for all team members

Even if you've reviewed this information before, changes can and do happen regularly, so it's highly recommended that you visit these overview pages to be aware of recent updates.  Changes are also announced on the [#mhv-change-announcements](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C03R5SBELQM) Slack channel.
