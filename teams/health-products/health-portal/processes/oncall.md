# On-Call Overview

Created: 2025-07-28

## Overview

The Health Portal team maintains three unique, but complementary on-call responsibilities to ensure system reliability, investigate technical issues, and provide user support. Each serves a specific purpose in our operational model and works together to maintain service quality and team productivity. Broadly, we can think of these roles as:

- **Monitoring On-Call**: Respond to system alerts and maintain service reliability
- **Investigator On-Call**: Handle non-urgent technical investigations and research
- **Tier 3 Support On-Call**: Provide escalated user support and technical assistance

One person might perform multiple roles depending on the situation. For example, a monitoring on-call engineer might also act as an investigator on-call when a non-urgent technical issue arises. Additionally, an investigator on-call can support a tier 3 support on-call when a more complex issue arises. A tier 3 support on-call engineer will also work with the monitoring on-call engineer when users are affected by system issues, or with the investigator on-call when additional resources are needed.

The Customer Support & Triage team will have a dedicated QA/Support engineer who will coordinate with the monitoring and investigator on-call engineers on customer support issues.

## On-Call Types

### 1. Monitoring On-Call
**Purpose**: Respond to system alerts and maintain service reliability

The monitoring on-call engineer is responsible for responding to automated alerts from our monitoring systems (Datadog), triaging incidents, and coordinating with relevant teams to resolve system issues. This role focuses on maintaining uptime and performance of our services.

### 2. Investigator On-Call
**Purpose**: Handle non-urgent technical investigations and research

The investigator on-call engineer addresses technical questions, conducts research, and investigates non-urgent issues that arise during development cycles. This role helps maintain team velocity by providing dedicated support for technical inquiries from stakeholders and team members while allowing other engineers to focus on planned work.

### 3. Tier 3 Support On-Call
**Purpose**: Provide escalated user support and technical assistance

The Tier 3 support on-call engineer handles user issues that have been escalated from lower support tiers. This role requires deep technical knowledge of our systems and the ability to troubleshoot user-specific problems that may require code-level investigation.

## Rotation Schedule

The monitoring and investigator on-call roles follow a weekly rotation schedule with handoffs occurring on Thursdays. Given monitoring and tier 3 on-call require attention to issues outside of normal business hours, coverage over weekends must be ensured. Thursday handoffs will allow the next on-call engineer to sync with the outgoing on-call engineer to note issues and ensure continuity of service.

## Escalation and Coordination

While each on-call role has distinct responsibilities, complex issues may require coordination between multiple on-call engineers:

- **Monitoring** â†’ **Investigator**: When alerts indicate systematic issues requiring research
- **Tier 3** â†’ **Monitoring**: When user issues reveal potential system problems
- **Investigator** â†’ **Tier 3**: When technical research reveals user impact

Each tool team will have a Slack group to which we'll rotate one or more engineers to when they are on-call. This will provide a way to coordinate and communicate effectively during on-call shifts.

## Getting Started

If you're new to on-call duties:

1. Review the specific documentation for your assigned role
2. Familiarize yourself with our monitoring tools and communication channels
3. Understand escalation procedures and team contact information
4. Review recent incidents and investigations for context
