# My HealtheVet Downtime Notification Process

The purpose of this document is to supplement existing downtime procedures with steps specific to the My HealtheVet (MHV) user-facing and API/Platform teams.

Teams will be agile with our process - iterating and refining as we use it and get feedback.

There may be instances where a user-facing impact can be anticipated due to planned activities.

Include the following information in messaging:
- Downtime Reason
- Anticipated Impact
- Planned Downtime Timeframe
- Rollback Plan

Notifications should go out:
- As soon as the team starts planning for the downtime
- Day before the downtime
- When the downtime has concluded

### MHV API/Platform Team
