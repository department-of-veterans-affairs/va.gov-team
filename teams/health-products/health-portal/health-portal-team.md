## Welcome
Welcome to the My HealtheVet Health Portal team.  We're glad you're here!  This document gives an overview of the team, our mission, structure, and what we're working on. 

## Team Mission
The My HealtheVet on VA.gov team’s mission is to simplify Veterans’ health experience on the web by consolidating all health things into a single health “home” on VA.gov. As we consolidate the health experience, we will work closely with the "classic" My HealtheVet / Office of Connected Care (OCC) and with teams throughout OCTO.
