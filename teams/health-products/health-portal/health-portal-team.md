## Welcome
Welcome to the My HealtheVet Health Portal team.  We're glad you're here!  This document gives an overview of the team, our mission, structure, and what we're working on. 

## Our Mission
The My HealtheVet on VA.gov team’s mission is to simplify Veterans’ health experience on the web by consolidating all health things into a single health “home” on VA.gov. As we consolidate the health experience, we will work closely with the "classic" My HealtheVet / Office of Connected Care (OCC) and with teams throughout OCTO.

## What We're Working On
The My HealtheVet portal team's main focus for the past several years has been rebuilding the standalone My HealtheVet patient health portal (currently referred to as My HealtheVet Classic) and integrating it into VA.gov.   

The My HealtheVet portal team’s mission is to simplify Veterans’ health experience on the web by consolidating all health things into a single health “home” on VA.gov. As we consolidate the health experience, we will work closely with the "classic" My HealtheVet / Office of Connected Care (OCC) and with teams throughout OCTO.
