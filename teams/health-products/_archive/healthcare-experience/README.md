## HealthCare Experience

**Description of Current Work**

Our goal is to improve the in-person and online pre-appointment experiences for veterans, contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities, and better integrate veteran-provided data in VA workflows by providing veterans with a digital option to complete pre-appointment questionnaires and screeners.
