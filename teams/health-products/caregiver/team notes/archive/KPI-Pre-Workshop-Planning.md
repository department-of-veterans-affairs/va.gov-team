# KPI Pre-Workshop Planning

### Product Line

- Platform

### North Star

- Reduce the amount of time it takes a Caregiver application to be processed


### Product

- Caregiver Application (10-10CG), online Caregiver experience

### High Level Objectives
_What are the objectives within your product line that your product plays into?_

_Stating this will help ensure your strategy for what to build and pain points to solve fall within the overall strategy._

- Increase Veteran (and caregiver) access to support by digitizing the 1010-CG Form
- Increase the Caregivers' confidence around the program, application process, and form submission
- Provide relevant information to Veterans and Caregivers in a way that is easy for them to understand

### Pain Points
_What are the major user and business pain points along the entirety of the service your product is a part of?_

1. Lack of clarity around program eligibility, requirements, and timeline (no single source of truth)
2. Application processing times are too long 
2b.Submission is a hassle - the veteran has to find the paper form, print it, fill it out, then mail in or bring to VA Medical Center
3. There is a lack of user control - they want to know application status throughout process
4. Veterans expressed concerns about who has access to their info

### Desired Outcomes
_What do you hope changes as a result of launching this product or feature?_

1. Increase Caregiver understanding/confidence throughout the program by providing a submission receipt and giving users more points of contact and reference.
2. More applications are filled out and processed properly
3. More people who are eligible for the Caregiver program apply and properly submit the needed information
4. Become a single source of truth for program eligibility, information, and requirements

### Hypotheses
_What do you plan to do/build/create to achieve your user and business goals?_

_ex: By creating more onboarding and training content, we expect teams to be more self-sufficient after they are onboarded._

- By digitizing the Application for the Comprehensive Caregiver Assistance Program (1010-CG Form), we will reduce application processing time and create more understanding and integrity around the program.
