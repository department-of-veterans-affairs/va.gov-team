## Open Questions
- How are we integrating plain language into the online 1010-CG experience while maintaining consistency with the paper form?
- What is considered a duplicate application? What do we need to do to prevent them?
- How are we going to roll the MVP out slowly?




## Action Items
- Define all requirements for MVP
- Create a launch plan
- Pick top 3 KPIs and identify baselines
- Weekly ToT Sync with Nitish, Caitlin, Natalia
- Service to notify veteran or caregiver of status change (or page to check)
- Prototype that includes MPI error message/redirect to print
- Next step: 
- Integration testing plan with David, Matt, CARMA team


## Notes:
| Create table in vets-api to link CARMA ID to form submission (+ date)| n/a
- `*` Options for Portal: 
  - Use application ID number to query for status update
  - Work with MPI to return status there
  - Add to Veteran profile/account
