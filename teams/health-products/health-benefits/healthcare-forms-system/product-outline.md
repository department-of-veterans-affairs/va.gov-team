# Product Outline - Healthcare Forms System
---

## Overview
*After you've explored the problem and through testing / hypothesis have identified the ideal solution, write up one sentence describing the solution you'll be creating.*


## Problem Statement
*In a couple of sentences, describe the Who, What, Why, and Where of the challenge / pain point you seek to address. [Here's a sample problem statement definition activity you can try on your team to help generate this](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/problem-framing)*

*Follow your problem description up with a "How might we... _______" statement re-framing that challenge as an opportunity. Don't hint too much at what the solution might be, you should have enough of a focal point here to guide your ideas, but plenty of freedom to think laterally and innovatively as you experiment and prototype later.*

Given that many forms have similar inputs, how might we make it easier for Veterans to apply for benefits?
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- As a veteran, I
  - Don't have to fill out the same information multiple times
  - Get benefits quicker
  - Understand what benefits I'm entitled to
  - Reduce the amount of information needed to apply for a benefit

- *Why would a user want to use this?*
- *With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*


## Undesired User Outcomes

- More confusing to users
- Lack of trust

## Desired Business Outcomes

- *Why would your business want this to exist?*
- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

- Able to better support veterans 
- Streamlined business processes

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- Unable to support a more streamlined workflow

## Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### KPIs
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_

- How long does it take to _____, ______, and ______?

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

### OKRs
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

- Faster to recieve benefits

---

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

- A streamlined form wizard would make it easier for Veterans to apply for multiple (or possibly, related) benefits at once.
- The business processes are similar enough that they could be combined

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

## KPIs
- *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
--- 

## Go-to-market Strategy
- *How are Veterans and others using this product going to know it exists?*
- *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful?*

## Target Launch Date
- *What is your target launch date of your MVP/iteration?*
- *What is your date for when you'll evaluate impact after launch?*
