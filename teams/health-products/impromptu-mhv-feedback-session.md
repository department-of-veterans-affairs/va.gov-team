# Impromptu MHV feedback session

*Background investigation interviewer had some comments about MHV to pass along*

Conversation took place on 9/11/19 

"It used to be great, then about a year ago they changed it"

"I used to be able to queue up my prescription refills in the system" It sounds like he had a backlog of scrips that he would "activate" when he needed them. But sometime in the last few months(?) the whole backlog got mailed to him without his intervention. I asked if this was a permanent change or if it went back to the old behavior (one-time glitch?) but he had not tried again

"It used to be easier, there are more steps now"

"I didn't used to have to sit and scratch my head to figure out what to do next"

Has reached out to Brockton VA and got offer from someone there for some training. But "I don't want to learn to use a bad system, I want them to fix the system"

"Login got worse" I couldn't get a clear picture here. I *think* that this is about the multiple paths?

"Maybe it's that there are more things you can do now, and so it has to be more complicated?"

"You should learn from Google" "Steal the white page"

He then sketched an empty page with buttons for the three big actions (with allowances that there might be more) that looked in broad strokes a lot like the VA.gov home page but I interpret this to mean big single use buttons more than our cards with multiple actions.

**FWIW**
