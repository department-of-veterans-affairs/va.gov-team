## Overview
This document outlines the unique and shared expectations of the Product Lead (OCTO government staff, sometimes referred to as Product Owner) and the Product Manager (usually a contractor). Please review this document together when starting work and then periodically as a check in — it will improve your communication and reduce stress.

The intention is to use this as a framework for communication and expectation setting between our ourselves and our teams.  The hypothesis is that this contributes to reducing stress and workload Creating a “one team” environment is the goal.  Consider the elements outlined here as a guideline, a list of jobs to be done.  Have the conversations about who is going to do them, what good looks like, and how you’ll communicate as a team overall.  Document the outcomes so that everyone is aware and on the same page. There is no replacement for a conversation.  

There are three key trigger points for when to have these conversations – outside of just setting up good practices.  

  * A whole new team is being formed 

  * Existing team is sufficiently changing its member makeup 

  * Existing team is taking on a new initiative that warrants revisiting existing expectations 

## Shared expectations
Additional, specific expectations related to these categories are described in the following PO/PM-specific sections. 

**Product documentation** Ensure product documentation — like the Product Outline — is up to date and publicly available on GitHub (or other appropriate locations). Document key decisions and product pivots. Onboard new team members by sharing documentation with them and explaining it.

  * Determine, communicate, and align the product direction and goals  
  * Ensure product documentation is accurate, useful, and not out of date 

* The Product Manager is responsible for 
  * Ensuring the team understands the product direction and goal and deliver towards it 
  * Writing and contributing to product documentation 

**Communication:** Foster healthy, open communication and blameless incident responses to continuously improve and grow as a team. Communicate in as open a channel as often as possible so that others may benefit — now or later while searching resources like GitHub or Slack.  

  * Proactively communicate the status and impact of the team’s work and cross-team dependencies to stakeholders, leadership, and other teams 

  * Provide regular updates to OCTO leadership and VA stakeholders about product development, improvements, challenges, and decisions

## Product Lead
Product Leads are primarily accountable for the outcomes of their products and services.
