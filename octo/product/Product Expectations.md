## Overview
This document outlines the unique and shared expectations of the Product Lead (OCTO government staff, sometimes referred to as Product Owner) and the Product Manager (usually a contractor). Please review this document together when starting work and then periodically as a check in — it will improve your communication and reduce stress.

The intention is to use this as a framework for communication and expectation setting between our ourselves and our teams.  The hypothesis is that this contributes to reducing stress and workload. Creating a “one team” environment is the goal.  Consider the elements outlined here as a guideline, a list of jobs to be done.  Have the conversations about who is going to do them, what good looks like, and how you’ll communicate as a team overall.  Document the outcomes so that everyone is aware and on the same page. There is no replacement for a conversation.  

There are three key trigger points for when to have these conversations – outside of just setting up good practices.  

  * A whole new team is being formed 

  * Existing team is sufficiently changing its member makeup 

  * Existing team is taking on a new initiative that warrants revisiting existing expectations 

## Shared expectations
Additional, specific expectations related to these categories are described in the following PO/PM-specific sections. 

**Product documentation** Ensure product documentation — like the Product Outline — is up to date and publicly available on GitHub (or other appropriate locations). Document key decisions and product pivots. Onboard new team members by sharing documentation with them and explaining it. 

* The Product Lead is responsible for working with the product manager, team, and stakeholders to  
  * Determine, communicate, and align the product direction and goals  
  * Ensure product documentation is accurate, useful, and not out of date 

* The Product Manager is responsible for 
  * Ensuring the team understands the product direction and goal and deliver towards it 
  * Writing and contributing to product documentation 

**Communication:** Foster healthy, open communication and blameless incident responses to continuously improve and grow as a team. Communicate in as open a channel as often as possible so that others may benefit — now or later while searching resources like GitHub or Slack.  

  * Proactively communicate the status and impact of the team’s work and cross-team dependencies to stakeholders, leadership, and other teams 

  * Provide regular updates to OCTO leadership and VA stakeholders about product development, improvements, challenges, and decisions 

  * Ensure the team understands the product, technical environments, and political environment 

 

**Goal and progress tracking** 

  * Define and track progress against KPIs and OKRs 

  * Create and share artifacts like roadmaps, product outlines, user stories, sprint goals, and release plans with platform and other impacted teams 

  * Share outcomes by participate in Impact Reviews after launches 

 

**Quality control** 

  * Ensure the team follows established OCTO product, design, and technical guidelines (for example, Platform Collab Cycles) 

  * Regularly review product analytics and task completion funnel data to track progress and identify problems 

 

**Data Driven** 
  * Analyze qualitative and quantitative data related to products and services, and be able to speak to that with any audience 
    * This looks like 
       * Provide feedback on discovery session plans and findings 
       * Approve KPI goals
         
## Product Lead
Product Leads are primarily accountable for the outcomes of their products and services. Other names you might hear include: OCTO team member, government lead, or Product Owner.

VA stakeholders are also referred to as Product Owners, so this can create some confusion. Sometimes, contractor Product Managers do some of this work too.

### Product vision

- **Prioritize and deliver**: Focus on value delivery and eliminate roadblocks.
- **Adapt and iterate the product**: Continuously review and update the vision and roadmap.
  
### Team leadership
- **Prioritize team health**: Foster a positive team culture while staying on track for delivery.
- **Lead by example**: Maintain a bias towards action and solve problems.
- **Protect the team**: Shield the team from unnecessary bureaucracy and external distractions.
  
### Partnership across VA
- **Build relationships**: Foster positive relationships and actively engage with VA colleagues.
- **Influence and align**: Gain commitments from key partners and resolve blockers.
- **Be humble**: Value folks’ experiences across VA. Approach diverse opinions with curiosity and empathy.
  
### Contract management
- **Guide work**: Support team onboarding and collaborate with Product manager to deliver prioritized work.
- **Monitor performance**: Evaluate vendor performance and escalate staffing gaps or performance issues.
- **Ensure compliance**: Ensure vendor adheres to contract terms and approve deliverables.
  
## Product Manager

**Product strategy, vision** 

* Transform Product Lead’s high-level vision into detailed action plans 

* Ensure the team understands the direction and goals of the product or service so they can deliver towards it
