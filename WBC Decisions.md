| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| 9/14/2018 | For Check Your GI Bill Benefits, VA letters, VIC, 526 SSCI these pages will continue to navigate to content page, no redirect, continue to tool button. <br />Griffins owns replacing the green buttons within Vets.gov content with the blue alert box/button that is used on preview.va.gov like on MHV tools. Need to account for a new state for on-site tool.<br />Hydra owns moving this page content to preview and applying the correct treatment | Chris Johnston,  David Bao  |
| 9/14/2018 | For Claims and Appeals Status these pages will follow the special redirect handling pattern similar to MHV. No need to put an additional content page in front of them. Keep current treatment of both buttons at top and bottom. <br />Revisit treatment of buttons on subway map pages post-launch/MVP | Chris Johnston,  David Bao  |
| 9/14/2018 | For 10/9, for beta we're fine with alt users having to log in again when directed to MHV pages. David will write content that reflects the actions users have to take (log in with ID.me or DS logon, not MHV, and log in again) based on the experience that they had. **Content should reflect that they should not create a new MHV account if they have already attempted to log in using their MHV credentials.**<br />Update reflected in the Rollout Doc | Chris Johnston,  David Bao  |
| 9/14/2018 | Push back beta test of full site experience from 10/9 to 10/16 in order to have an additional week of moderated usability testing<br />Update reflected in the Rollout Doc | Chris Johnston              |
| 9/14/2018 | **No more team responsibility swaps.** It's a waste of time, resources and effort. We're running out of time to do this work and swapping resources is a waste of everyone's time. | ALL                         |
| 9/14/2018 | Transfer Teamsite Header/Footer effort to Dragons, effective immediately. De-scope search v2 as a priority for launch/MVP.<br />Update reflected in the Rollout Doc | Steve Kovacs, James Kassemi |
| 9/14/2018 | For MVP, The "My Health" link in the Header will open the home page of My HealtheVet in a new tab. | Chris Johnston, Andy Lewandowski |
| 9/17/2018 | Trevor is responsible for accessibility ONLY on VA.gov pages, VA global utilities, VA global mega menu, and VA global footer that are on the Veteran Facing Services stack (including tools built by BAH, Veracity, and AbleVets). He cannot ensure compliance of any old VA pages that we do not currently have control over. | Lauren Alexanderson, Mary O'Toole, Andrew Hughey |
| 9/17/2018 | Sign in/profile navigation scenarios <br> 1) User clicks on Sign In button in header from any page on the site - they sign in and remain on the page they were on. <br> 2) User clicks on Sign In button on home page - they sign in and remain on the home page. <br> 3) User is directed to sign in when attempting to access a tool that requires authentication (i.e. claim status or refill rx) - they sign in and are directed to the tool they were trying to access. <br> 4)  User navigates directly to /my-va before signing in - they routed to sign in and are directed to My VA page (dashboard). <br> 5)  User navigates directly to /account before signing in - they routed to sign in and are directed to Account. <br> 6)  User navigates directly to /profile before signing in - they routed to sign in and are directed to Profile. <br> 7)  User clicks on "Home" in breadcrumb from anywhere on the site - they are taken to the home page. <br> 8)  User clicks on VA logo from anywhere on the site - they are taken to the home page. <br> 9)  User clicks on My VA option in header - they are taken to the My VA page (dashboard). <br> 10)  User clicks on Profile in the header (under signed in name) - they are taken to Profile page. <br> 11)  User clicks on Account in the header (under signed in name) - they are taken to Account page. <br> 12)  User clicks on Sign Out from anywhere on the site - they are signed out and taken to the home page . | Andy Lewandowski, Mikki Northuis |
| 9/18/2018 | Search MVP is in scope for Nov 7 launch (MVP = functioning search feature, replicating Vets.gov functionality, but w/new VA branding). Search V2 deprioritized as out of scope for Nov 7 to make room for TeamSite header/footer injection work. | Andy, Chris, Steve |
| 9/18/2018 | In order to avoid breaking the form functionality while migrating from Vets.gov to VA.gov (namely form routing), we've decided to revert back to the existing Vets.gov URL structure for all of the forms. | Andy Lewandowski, Ryan Luu, Rian Fowler|
| 9/18/2018 | Nav items and links that link to pages that are EXTERNAL TO VA.GOV domain, should open in a new tab/window. Nav items and links that link to pages WITHIN THE VA.GOV domain, should open in the same tab/window.  Exceptions to this rule can be made for  VA.gov subdomains or pages that have a different design and user experience from the core VA.gov experience.  Examples include, but not limited to accesstocare.va.gov, data.va.gov, oit.va.gov.   | Mikki Northuis, Andy Lewandowski|
| 9/18/2018 |Login (for dependents and caregivers) - For MVP, no changes are needed to accommodate these groups. Griffinâ€™s team will monitor any issues reported by the call center for these users and handle in future releases. | David Bao, Chris Johnston
| 9/18/2018 |DS Logon  - No changes will be made to the way users access this feature.  | David Bao, Chris Johnston
| 9/18/2018 |Login FAQ content - Updates will be made to the current login/identity FAQs to reflect new whitelabeling changes. Joe has reviewed the existing content and provided recommendations that will be implemented for MVP. (#11491)  | David Bao, Chris Johnston
| 9/19/2018 | [Confirmed with Carnetta from MHV](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/180919%20MHV:VA.gov%20Terms%20and%20Conditions%20for%20Medical%20Information.pdf) that the current Vets.gov Health Tools Terms & Conditions are *not* required in VA.gov, as the health tools will not be hosted on VA.gov. Therefore, VA.gov may freely create and upgrade MHV accounts for users without asking them to accept T&C. | David Bao |
| 9/19/2018 | The "My Health" link will show up for *all* logged in users, and we will not attempt to create MHV accounts for those who do not have them for now. | David Bao, Ben Barone, Chris Johnston |
| 9/21/2018 | For links to PDFs provided by third parties (i.e., life insurance companies who provide forms for VA Life Insurance benefits), we should link to the higher level of content on VA.gov that provides contextual information and the most up-to-date PDF form. (Life insurance is the only benefit that we know of that use third-party forms.) For links to PDFs provided by VA or another government agency, we will continue to link directly to the PDF form. (No change from what we currently do.) | Andy Lewandowski |
| 9/24/2018 | For Privacy Policy, fow no, we'll get the new URL up to a page w/existing privacy content. We'll implement the new content as soon as it's approved within VA. | Chris, Melissa |
