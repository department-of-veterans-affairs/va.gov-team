# Homepage alert banners
- Updateable through index .md file in the vagov-content repository
- Requires a reviewer to approve before changes can be published
- Will be updated by VA Stakeholders
- Will be used for things like weather alerts
- Will only display on the homepage
- Displays at the very top of the page

# System alert banners
- Updateable through normal downtime alert processes (however they happened on Vets.gov)
- Will be used for things like downtime notifications
- Currently being leveraged for the "You're viewing a preview of the new VA.gov" alert
- In the rare case that a global alert on the homepage AND a homepage alert exist at the same time, this global alert should stack directly below the homepage alert like this:
