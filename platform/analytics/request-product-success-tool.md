## How to Request the Product Success Tool for your application

Once you have your product's KPIs, fill out the Github request template (link to be added) with your KPIs linked to the template.

In order to ensure that KPIs will be tracked for product decisions, please ensure that your KPIs are **linked to OKRs or product/user goals.** 

*If you would like support with determining your KPIs or linking them to OKRs, please take a look at the [data journey deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OGdCLFYGA4cb5nDUTJOme_7UBdAM49bX5zpYZ-zg6rw/edit#slide=id.g6d866f9dc2_0_165) or feel free to reach out to VSP Analytics & Insights on the #vfs-platform-support channel.

### Timing

VSP Analytics & Insights will generally take 2-3 sprints to fulfill your request, depending on the complexity of your metrics.

KPIs that have additional definitions or annotations can help speed up the process.

**Example:** 

Metric: Urgent Care Searches

Additional Definitions: 
- "I would like to see where users are clicking out from Urgent Care searches"
- "I would like to see how many PDF downloads are happening after Urgent Care searches"
- "I would like to see how many users are using the search term "Urgent Care""
