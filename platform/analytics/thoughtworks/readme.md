## Thoughtworks Scorecard Discovery Sprint

Analytics & Insights support work & readouts from the Thoughtworks discovery sprint in March 2020.

### Credentials for Google Analytics
The Analytics & Insights team worked with Andrew Gunsch and Nancy Smith by requesting a new Google Cloud Project Organization (aka GCP org) and new Google Analytics API project connected to the org. Andrew Gunsch shared the user name and password via CredStash, and Nedie Recel provided the new API email with View Access to the Google Analytics Production property.
