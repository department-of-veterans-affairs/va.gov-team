# How to request a Medallia survey

**Summary:** this document outlines Medallia surveys and how you can request one for your Veteran-facing service.

**Background:** What is a Medallia survey? Medallia is the tool we use to receive veteran feedback on VA.gov. Data from Medallia is shared with the VEO, is in compliance with PRA, and the template below has pre-approved platform design and content.

## How to request a survey

The issue will be triaged to the VSP Contact Center team and will be implemented in Staging based on the URLs provided. Once approved by the VFS product manager or product owner in staging, the survey will be pushed to Production and the issue will be closed after another approval.

Please allow 1-2 sprints for the survey to be implemented, depending on the complexity.
