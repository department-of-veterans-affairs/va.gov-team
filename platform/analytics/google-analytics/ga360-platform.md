## Google Analytics 360 Platform

VA.gov uses the paid tier for Google Analytics, called Google Analytics 360 or GA 360. The premium versions offers a higher tier of data collection and more customizable traits that we can use to measure success. 

_Audience for this Resource_: This resource is for all team members who want to understand the tools available to VA.gov for measuring our success and how these platforms are accessed. 

_Access_: To access Google Analytics, you should have completed VSP orientation or requested access via #vfs-platform-support. Your VA.gov or contractor email address must be tied to a Google Account before we can provision you with access. 

## Analytics

## Tag Manager

Google Tag Manager is a tool where analytics users can control what is sent to Google Analytics. It is implemented by a JavaScript snippet across all pages of VA.gov. The Analytics-Insights team collaborates with front-end engineers to create a set of requirements for dataLayer events that communicate this data via Google Tag Manager and ultimately to Google Analytics.
