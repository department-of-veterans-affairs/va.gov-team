## Welcome to Google Analytics

VA.gov uses the paid tier for Google Analytics, called Google Analytics 360 or GA 360. The premium versions offers a higher tier of data collection and more customizable traits that we can use to measure success. 

The Admins for the VSP Analytics-Insights Team are Joanne Esteban, Nedie Recel, and Jon Wehausen. 

### Resources for Google Analytics

We want to help you measure the success of the products you are building for veterans and their families. We highly encourage engagement with the VSP Analytics-Insights team throughout the lifecycle of your product.
