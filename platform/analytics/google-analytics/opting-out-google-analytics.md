## Analytics Opt-Out

#### Who should read this?
All VA.gov product teams, leadership, and other internal users of VA.gov should review this resource.

#### Why should we opt-out?
To best separate our product team's activity from veterans, their families, and other users of VA.gov, we ask all product teams and other internal VA staff to opt-out of tracking on their device(s).  

Please take a minute to visit this link on all of the devices, including your desktop(s), smartphones, and tables, that you might use to do testing on the production site: [VA.gov Analytics Opt-Out](https://www.va.gov/analytics-opt-out.html)

#### How the Opt-Out Process Works
By clicking on this link, it will set a cookie that allows us to distinguish you as a VA.gov Internal User. Google Analytics then filters out any device where it is marked as an Internal User. 

This cookie will expire in 2 years. If you clear cookies often, you'll have to visit this link again to opt-out of tracking.

#### Tracking on Non-Production Environments
The cookie is only used on the Production site to filter out Internal Users. All activity on non-production environments _is_ tracked, so we can QA the Google Analytics data before it reaches production.

#### Does being on a VPN affect my data in Google Analytics?
While a VPN itself will probably not affect our analytics opt-out or modify the cookies we use to identify you, a VPN may affect the data we record in Google Analytics. Specifically, location or geo data can be inaccurate and constantly changing.

Please note that some VPN software includes additional browser extensions that may clear or block cookies.
