## Tracking Form Events
For multi-step veteran forms, VFS teams can implement dataLayer events that will be pushed to Google Analytics based on a set of standard event schema. These events match settings that the Analytics-Insights team has established within Google Tag Manager. 

Before you review this document, please review [Measuring Pageviews and Events.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/analytics/google-analytics/build-process-measuring-pageviews-and-events.md)

### Data Dictionary for Form Events
The dataLayer events listed in the table below should populate the `event` value in the `event-goes-here` example. 

`dataLayer.push({'event': 'event-goes-here'});`

In the table where it lists \<product\>, please reference the Product prefix table in the bottom of the [Measuring Pageviews and Events documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/analytics/google-analytics/build-process-measuring-pageviews-and-events.md#event-tracking) and insert your product's prefix. If your Product area is not listed, please reach out to the Analytics-Insights team via the [Analytics-Insights GitHub Issue](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=joanneesteban%2C+bsmartin-ep%2C+jonwehausen&labels=analytics-insights%2C+analytics-request%2C+collaboration-cycle&template=analytics-implementation-and-qa-request-template.md&title=Analytics+Implementation+or+QA+Support+for+%5BProduct%5D) and also within the [#vsp-analytics](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/vsp-analytics) channel for guidance.
