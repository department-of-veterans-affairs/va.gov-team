## Definitions: 

**Data** is a set of qualitative or quantitative information that can give you more information about your product. 

**Metrics** are number subsets of the data.

**KPIs** (**K**ey **P**erformance **I**ndicators) are the main framework in which we use data and metrics on VA.gov.


# Introduction: why use data for digital services

Before we get started on how to use data to inform decision making, we’ll walk through some context and definitions on why we use data on VA.gov in the first place.


## Data in Government: What & Why


### What is data-informed decision making & why use it for VA.gov services?

We use data-informed product management to **help measure what matters**. In addition to user research and ideation, data tells us if we have been successful and helps verify what is or isn’t working with our products and services. It helps us test our hypotheses, inform product management about what has happened, and guide decisions on what should happen.


## Definitions: 

**Data-informed** means we have enough data available to understand our product’s health and performance and make educated decisions. 

**Data-driven** means we have all of the data that we need in place to make decisions solely based on statistical analyses. 

We are **data-informed as opposed to data-driven** because, on VA.gov, we use human-centered design. Instead of using data to tell us exactly what to do, we use it along with other research to inform our decisions.

**User research is used along with data**. Think of data as knowing a little bit about most of the people, and user research as knowing a lot more about a few of those people.

## What are KPIs & why are they useful?

We define product KPIs (key performance indicators) as metrics to evaluate the overall success of your product. Each KPI must have a **baseline**, to know where the metric is currently at, and a **target**, to have a goal for success. KPIs are used to evaluate the success of your product’s **OKRs** (Objectives and Key Results). One OKR can have multiple KPIs, we suggest 1-3.  \



## Why is having product KPIs important to product management on VA.gov?



1. provide a bigger, more holistic picture to your product’s success rather than using only a small portion of user feedback from research or comments, 
2. help inform your product’s roadmap, 
3. help build team autonomy and accountability, 
4. help your stakeholders understand your decisions and results, and 
5. track your product’s health over time to maintain optimal services for veterans. 


## Why do KPIs need to be prioritized?

Too many KPIs can cause confusion and overload, whereas prioritized, focused KPIs provide strategic, meaningful directions. 

Having a large number of KPIs is like presenting a long, heavy slide deck when asked to present a brief, focused presentation. It can also be like having too many user stories and tickets at once, and then instead of a focused product, you’re building multiple features for multiple different goals. 


### What are vanity metrics & how do we stay away from them?

**Vanity metrics** are metrics that can be exciting to share but are not necessarily actionable. They don’t help you make decisions and aren’t linked to user or business goals. 

Using our KPI framework will guide you away from vanity metrics. The VA.gov minimum standard for KPIs is that they are clearly linked back to user and business outcomes. 


## How does data fit with user research?

Don’t do away with your user research! **User research** is qualitative data that is also extremely valuable in understanding veterans and their digital needs. **User data** helps validate your user research, fact-check any anecdotal information, and can inform you if you need to go back and speak to more users. User research and data work together. 


## What kind of data should I focus on, business or user data?

On VA.gov, we suggest that you use both business and user KPIs and strongly suggest using user KPIs to ensure veteran success. **Business KPIs** ensure that your product is optimized for the Veteran Affairs offices. **User KPIs** ensure that your decisions are based on veteran outcomes and help veterans.

# Set your KPIs

Before starting to set your KPIs, you’ll need to have your product’s:

1. Mission
2. Vision
3. User Goals

Without a fundamental grasp of what you want your product to be and how you want veterans to use it, it will be difficult to understand what _metrics_ you will need to understand the success of your product.

We also suggest setting your product KPIs before you start building. It helps align your team around your product’s goals and what you’ll be looking for to determine if what you’re building is successful. At VA.gov, we have a few different sets of KPIs to help you measure health and success.



<<image>>



## Definitions: 

**North Star Metric**: (Overall Product Goal) Your leading indicator of success. 

**Objectives & Key Results (OKRs) 
Objective**: The outcome the team needs to achieve to improve the user experience on VA.gov.

**Key Result**: The measurable (qualitative or quantitative) indicators that the team needs to meet for the objective to be true.

**Product KPIs** Metrics to evaluate the overall success of your product. Use these over time to prioritize your roadmaps.

**Rollout KPIs** (Secondary Metrics) Time-bound metrics that are vital to evaluate the release of your product. Use this to evaluate if you should continue releasing your product, or go back to fix something. Some of these metrics may or may not be product KPIs, depending on your intended outcomes and what you will need to track over time.

**Discovery Metrics** (Secondary Metrics) Metrics that can be helpful to understand the background of a product or service space, but may not necessarily mean success over-time.

**Performance Metrics** The minimum set of standards that must always be true for your KPIs or OKRs to be successful or to enable good UX and outcomes.


## How to set & prioritize your Product KPIs

At VA.gov, our minimum standard for KPIs is that they are linked back to business and user metrics. We also suggest that you have a mix of quantitative and qualitative data; quantitative data helps with accuracy for your analysis, and qualitative data helps give you context.

_**Include updated framework & workshop**_

We strongly recommend using analytics from multiple sources to provide a more holistic view of your product’s health and success.

# Analyze & React to your KPIs

Now that you’re tracking your KPIs, how do you analyze and react to them? What does it mean if you go over or under your targets or baselines? And what do “use it to prioritize your roadmap” or “plan for your next sprint” actually mean?

At the end of the day, remember that tracking metrics isn’t the end of your analytics journey and that you should be using your data to help you make decisions and tell a story around it.


## Here are some suggestions for reacting to your KPIs:


### Digging deeper into your metrics: 

If a metric is below or above your baseline or target, always ask **why.**

If a metric is below or above the target:

What happened to make this metric move? Is something broken? Is a design difficult to use? If so, you may need to re-prioritize your next sprint or your roadmap to fix this issue. User research can also be used to dive deeper into how veterans experience the product.


### Compare metrics

User behavior might not happen in a vacuum. Compare your KPIs to see if the behavior correlates or if something is off. 

If Google Analytics traffic looks fine, but several users are calling in and providing feedback on a specific part of your service, you might want to look into your performance metrics to see if something is performing below standards. 

If you’re providing quick-glance content and users are scrolling through to the end of your page and several users are calling in and asking about a specific detail that’s at the bottom of your page, you may want to re-evaluate your sprint objectives or roadmap to prioritize that use-case to an easier-to-reach spot.

Remember correlation **does not** equal causation!


### Don’t let the data _drive_ you

Remember to pay attention to outliers and other causes of why the data might point to a shift. Does your traffic go up significantly on Wednesdays? That could mean that your service is needed on Wednesdays, or it could mean that marketing leads to referrals on Wednesdays but users are exiting before using your service. Remember to continue to ask **why** data has shifted before coming to conclusions. Data will help you know that something is happening. It will not tell you WHY something is happening.

Use prioritization methods to take what you find from your analyses into consideration as you plan your roadmaps and sprints.


## What do the different types of metrics mean for VA.gov?


### Customer Satisfaction & Trust

Since we provide essential digital services for veterans and their families, our services represent the VA’s ability to deliver services for veterans and may be the only point of contact that our users have with the VA or the only way that veterans can receive certain services. It is important to track user satisfaction and trust with your product to find out if your product meets users’ expectations and needs.


### Findability

Many of the services on VA.gov are vital to veterans and their families. They should be able to find the service regardless of the referral or operating system, otherwise, they can’t use your service.


### (Task) Service Completion

When looking at user behavior, it’s helpful to segment your users and ask what interactions they are performing or not performing and why.

Did users receive the service they needed? Did they find the information they were looking for, successfully use the tool, or apply for the benefit they needed and were eligible for?

For veteran services, conversions might not necessarily mean success. For example, for forms, if users are coming to your page and then leaving before they go onto the form, this may mean that they found that they don’t meet the eligibility criteria or have the documents necessary to use the form and apply for the benefit. On the other hand, if users are coming to your page and several users who are ineligible to apply for the benefit do complete the form, then your onboarding information page was not successful in deterring ineligible users from taking the time to complete your form. 

It’s important to ask which user behaviors are successful and which mean additional UX tweaks.


### Help Desk (Contact Centers)

If a user is having difficulty accessing or using your digital service, they should be able to call the VA contact centers for assistance. It is vital that if there is a large UX change or a new product on VA.gov that you complete a [contact center review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=Kimberley+Daniels%2C+Chante+LantosSwett&labels=contact+center%2C+analytics-insights%2C+analytics-request%2C+collaboration+cycle&template=request-contact-center-review-template.md&title=Contact+Center+Review+for+%5BTool%5D) so that the contact centers understand your product and can help veterans through any issues they may have.

When a large portion of users calls into the contact centers about an issue with your product or service, you can use this information as direct user feedback as to an issue your product is experiencing, which may be a bug, an issue with external services, or a design change.

The VSP Contact Center representatives will also triage any relevant Tier 3 issues to your team to help escalate veteran-facing issues.


### Back end services & website performance vs. user errors

For your product’s user design to be the first and foremost part of the user experience, your application should also be “performing” to minimum standards (you can see this in the Performance dashboards, tbd). 

If your content is slow to load or your tool is taking half a minute to buffer before displaying what the veteran is looking for, their first user experience with your service is going to be frustrating or even non-existent if they exit.

# Present your KPIs

Another part of using data to inform product decisions on VA.gov is sharing those metrics. Transparency allows others at the VA to understand your product’s performance and why certain decisions were made. Don’t assume that your results will speak for themselves. You’ve done the work to analyze your data as an integral part of your decision making, so make sure you’re sharing your data results and the _impact_ they made.

We recommend sharing your launch readouts and weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annual success stories in Team of Teams, Slack, and other open venues where others can learn about your product and the success of services provided to veterans and their families.

# Re-evaluate and reflect on your KPIs

Congratulations! You have set, tracked, and used your metrics to make your product decisions. But your analytics journey isn’t over yet! Using analytics to make decisions with product management on VA.gov is a continuous cycle. So what should you do to reflect on your analytics and ensure you continue to use the data? 


## Reflect 

As you get more comfortable setting KPIs, we suggest that while you plan for your roadmap every quarter, you also re-evaluate your KPIs. This can help ensure that your KPIs are up-to-date and reflect your product goals.


## Re-evaluate

Some questions you can ask while re-evaluating:
*   Were you able to accurately measure this metric? 
*   Did this metric inform you if your outcome/objective was met or was healthy?
