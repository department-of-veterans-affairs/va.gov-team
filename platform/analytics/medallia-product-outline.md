# Medallia Product Outline
---

## Overview
*Medallia is a part of the VSignals, VA-wide solution for receiving customer feedback.*

## Problem Statement
In order to build satisfying experiences for veterans and their families on VA.gov, VFS teams need a way to collect direct user feedback from users as scale so that they can back up their research and quantitive data with direct user sentiment. Medallia is a tool that will enable VFSs to collect feedback specifically for their product directly from users as they use the site.

**How might we implement Medallia so that VFS teams get the information they need to build more satisfying products and give VA.gov users an easy and effective way to provide helpful feedback to the teams building VFSs.**
 
## Desired User Outcomes

VFS teams can easily add surveys to their products so that they can collect direct user feedback.
- They can differentiate customer satisfaction for their products
- They can segment customer satisfaction to dive deeper into feedback

VFS teams receive accurate customer satisfaction data

## Undesired User Outcomes
- VFSs each have unique and different survey intercepts and questions; VA.gov users are bombarded and confused by varying experiences throughout VA.gov
- We collect and accidentally distribute PII
- VA.gov users view the surveys as ways to ask questions and receive feedback from VFS teams
- The data collection is confusing, and VFS teams don't understand how to accurately read the customer satisfaction data

## Desired Business Outcomes

- DEPO is able to use the feedback information to:
    - Understand overall va.gov satisfaction
    - Understand va.gov satisfaction by benefit hub
    - Easily report customer satisfaction and trust to varying stakeholders

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- DEPO receives inaccurate customer satisfaction data or data that is not easy to read, and reports inaccurate data to stakeholders
