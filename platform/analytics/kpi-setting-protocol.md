# KPI Setting Protocol

**Audience**: VFS teams

**Goal**: All VFS teams will have Key Performance Indicators set up, be supported in tracking their data, and use these metrics for data-driven product decisions and goals. 

## KPI Setting Workshops (_As a part of the initial weeks of VSP orientation_)
1. The VFS team will reach out to VSP Analytics & Insights on [#vfs-platform-support](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/vfs-platform-support) to set up KPI setting workshops with teams building products or services in the VA.gov ecosystem - this includes VFS and VSP teams.
2. VSP will send the VFS Team a [link to a pre-work template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/analytics/kpi-setting-pre-workshop-template.md) before the workshop.
3. The VFS team needs to create a file from this template in their /team folder in GitHub, and meet internally to fill it out before the Workshop.
4. VSP Analytics & Insights will facilitate the KPI Workshop itself, to lead teams through setting the KPIs for their product(s). Teams will collaborate in this meeting via screenshare, to fill out a KPIs Google Sheet hosted by VSP Analytics & Insights.
5. Post-workshop, VSP Analytics & Insights will Slack an Excel version of the Google Sheet to the team, and the team will upload it to their product folder.

## Ongoing KPI Setting (_Post Orientation_)
1. VSP Analytics & Insights will incorporate results from KPI workshops and check-ins to the Product Health Tool.
2. VSP Analytics & Insights will perform quarterly KPI check-ins with each team. 
    - These check-ins will incorporate the KPI results, resulting actions, and any adjustments to KPIs.
3. VSP Analytics & Insights will be readily available for team questions and updates on KPIs and product health metrics through the [#vfs-platforrm-support](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/vfs-platforrm-support) Slack channel.
