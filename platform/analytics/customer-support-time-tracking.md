## Toggl Customer Support Tracking  

### Purpose
- To enable the Analytics & Insights team to track time + efforts spent supporting customer support requests over time, we would like 
to standardize the way we track our customer support 

### Background
- Toggl is the current solution Empirical Path contractors utilize for time tracking on the VSP contract
- Toggl has **three fields** to classify for time tracking:<br>
      - _Description_: Free-text field description of work performed<br>
      - _Project_: Pre-determine field to identify the project<br>
      - _Tag_: Customizable field to provide additional context / categorization to work performed
 - Toggl includes a start + stop button to signal time spent
 
 
 ### Customer Support Time Tracking Process
 - Beginning as early as Sprint 51, team members executing customer support should begin tracking their time according to the standards below: 
     - _Description_: **ALWAYS** precede your description with the GH issue number of work performed if there is one applicable, if not consider creating one, i.e "15974 - Round 1 QA Testing " 
     - _Project_: For simplicity and consistency, track all time to the existing "Veteran-Facing Services Program (VSP) - Ongoing Support" project
     - _Tag_: Assign **1** tag that represents most closely to actual work performed, this tag should align closely with whats documented in the description, for a full list see table below
          - _If having performed several pieces of work, please retroactively do your best to itemize this work to 1 specific tag for each type of work performed_
