## How to Request a KPI dashboard for your application

*Overview*: The process for how to request a KPI dashboard.

*Audience*: VFS teams requesting a KPI dashboard for their applications.

---

Once you have your product's KPIs, fill out the [Github request template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=joanneesteban&labels=analytics-insights%2C+analytics-request%2C+kpi-dashboard&template=analytics-request-kpi-dashboard.md&title=Analytics+KPI+dashboard+request+for+%5BTeam%5D) with your KPIs on your Product Outline linked to the template.

In order to ensure that KPIs will be tracked for product decisions, please ensure that your KPIs are clearly mapped back to veteran goals/outcomes. **We highly recommend using the [KPI framework](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/analytics/Analytics%20Playbook/va-gov-platform-analytics-kpi-framework.pdf) to guide your KPI setting.** The product outline template on Github has current guidelines to ensure that your goals are linked back to Findability, Ease of Use, Service Completion, and Trust.

*If you need support with determining your KPIs, please take a look at the [KPI framework](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/analytics/Analytics%20Playbook/va-gov-platform-analytics-kpi-framework.pdf), [data journey deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OGdCLFYGA4cb5nDUTJOme_7UBdAM49bX5zpYZ-zg6rw/edit#slide=id.g6d866f9dc2_0_165), the [KPI Setting workshop](https://app.mural.co/t/adhocvetsgov9623/m/adhocvetsgov9623/1591285060838/5b950dfe08c860feb2b26d049665f8a043ee278d) or feel free to reach out to VSP Analytics & Insights on the [#vfs-platform-support](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/vfs-platform-support) channel for "in-person" support.

(Future State: Adding baselines/targets to your KPIs)

### Timing

VSP Analytics & Insights will generally take 2-4 sprints to fulfill your request, depending on the complexity of your metrics.

KPIs that have additional definitions or annotations can help speed up the process.

**Example:** 

Metric: Urgent Care Searches

Additional Definitions: 
- "I would like to see where users are clicking out from Urgent Care searches"
- "I would like to see how many PDF downloads are happening after Urgent Care searches"
- "I would like to see how many users are using the search term "Urgent Care""

Additional Examples:
- "Average page load time for va.gov/decision-reviews" *over* "page load time"

We may reach out for a follow up meeting to further define your goals. 

### Follow Up

We ask that you report updates to or usage of your metrics in public spaces, such as Team of Teams or Slack. (This section may be updated in the future with additional guidance). 

As you track your KPIs, you may find that previous assumptions may have been changed or that your metrics no longer back your product success. In case your KPIs themselves need to be updated, please feel free to reach out to fill out the [request issue template]( ) again and we can initiate an update to your dashboard.
