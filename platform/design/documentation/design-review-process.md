1. Designer prepares for the design review in advance
   - If needed, designer schedules review
   - At least a half day in advance, the designer sends around a slack message detailing:
       - Project constraints: (e.g. content can't be changed)
       - Project goals
       - timeline
       - Current level of fidelity
       - Devices to bring, if needed
       - Goals of the review ("I'm looking for feedback especially on..")
       - Shares a link to design (whatever you have)

2. The review
   - All reviewers are expected to have reviewed the design on their own
   - The designer shows the design and explains to reviewers the context of this design. (E.g. What problems were you solving
   - The designer explains what they think is strong about the design, and what they are struggling with.

3. Reviewers discuss the design
   - The designer will step back and withdraw from the discussion.
   - Instead of referring to the designer, they should refer to the design.
   - Instead of talking to the designer, they should talk to each other.
   - The reviewers should point out good aspects of the design as well as discuss areas that they’d like to see improved.
   - By intentionally excluding the designer from this conversation, the dialogue can cover more ground and the feedback can be more honest. Otherwise, the dialogue has a good chance of focusing on a single point or so as the designer begins to explain or defend their decisions. That will derail good feedback, and everyone loses out on good information. People’s feelings are also at risk.

4. The designer rejoins the conversation.
   - Once the facilitator has determined the design has been discussed enough, they will invite the designer back into the discussion.
   - The designer can now summarize the notes they have taken in order to give the reviewers the opportunity to catch any misinterpretations.
   - They can also ask follow up questions to clarify feedback they may not have fully understood.
   - The designer will probably want to defend the work or explain it, but really doesn’t have to.
   - After the meeting, the designer sends around the notes so that everyone is on the same page.
