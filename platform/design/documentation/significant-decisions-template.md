# Significant decisions

If you spend any time going back on forth (internally or with stakeholders) on a design, code, or content decision , write it down here.

The purpose of this document is to record decisions you've made so that your team can move forward (and stop having the same conversation over and over). In the future, you might revist this decision. But this document will help you avoid rehashing the same conversation because you will have notes on the background and decision.
