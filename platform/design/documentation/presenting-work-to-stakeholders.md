# Things to remember when presenting project work to new or busy people
As a product team it is sometimes easy to forget that not everyone has been along for the ride with you. Giving the audience some context for the work you are presenting will help them understand why you did it the way you did. 

This is framed as an introductory exercise, but these are also good questions to keep in mind during the demo itself. If you remember the parts of the product that were hard to figure out initially, those are good sections to provide some extra detail for. Anything in that category should probably also be in a Significant Decisions doc in your project repo.

## What is the problem we’re solving?
> Education Benefits are currently applied for and modified online using VONAPP. VONAPP is a creaky system with poor user experience. We want Veterans, Servicemembers, and dependents to be able to easily and comfortably understand and apply for Education Benefits, regardless of screen size or need for assistive devices. Transitioning this form to Vets.gov will increase the utility of Vets.gov and is a necessary precurser to the desired shutting down VONAPP.

## What state is this work at? What kind of feedback is helpful?
> This is the 1990, the first of six forms. Veterans use it to initiate a claim for Education Benefits. We’re starting with this one because it is overwhelmingly the most used. We believe this is ready to launch, please throw a flag if you see something worrying.

## What usability feedback have we gotten on this solution?
> We did initial discovery work with stakeholders and Veterans to understand pain points in the process. We did two rounds of usability testing with both mock-ups, and later, a live form on a staging server. We will be paying close attention to metrics and contact center feedback in the weeks following soft launch. In this case, soft launch means that people will be able to find and use the form on Vets.gov, but we will not be redirecting traffic from the existing form.

## What kind of metrics are informing this work? (Baseline: source, date)
> About 90% of application are currently filed online. The 1990 comprises about 56% of almost 400k form submissions per year. Because most forms are filed online, we don’t anticipate a significant increase in total number of applications.

_It’s okay if the answer to some of these is “we don‘t know yet”, but it’s good to have thought about it ahead of time and have a ready response._
