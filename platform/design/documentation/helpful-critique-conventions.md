Note: this is somewhat duplicative of [an exisiting design review doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Design/Documentation%20and%20Readouts/Design%20Review%20Process.md) but I don't have time to merge the two at the moment

# Critique conventions

Some helpful ground rules for effective critique sessions

1. Have a dedicated facilitator who keeps the time, and takes notes.
2. Session
   1. Presenter sets up the work they are presenting with a little context
   2. Presenter asks for type of feedback they are looking for and scopes to a subset of the work if desired
   3. Presenter spends a few minutes walking through the work
   4. Participants ask clarifying questions
      1. Facilitator keeps these limited if necessary
      2. Presenter gives focused answers to clarify background or resolve misunderstanding, but it's not necessary to defend the work.
   5. Participants weigh in with feedback about the area the presenter has requested
   6. Facilitator documents and keeps an eye on clock and participation
      1. Keep talkers under control and encourage full participation from group
      2. Sometimes a set order can be helpful
3. Tips:
   1. Keep feedback constructive and focused on the desired scope
   2. +1 is better than reiterating
