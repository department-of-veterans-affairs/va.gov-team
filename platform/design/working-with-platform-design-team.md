# Working with the Platform Design Team
(this is a work in progress doc: things are likely to change. This should be in tip top shape by Jan 2020)

## Working with the Veteran-facing Services Platform (VSP) Design Team
This document helps all teams working on VA.gov understand when you should engage VSP design resources for collaboration, design review, and support. All teams building on the VA.gov platform must follow VA.gov design best practices and guidelines in order to provide Veterans with an excellent customer experience. Working with the VSP design team helps ensure that we maintain consistent design language that supports the best Veteran user experience across the site.

## How Veteran-Facing Services (VFS) teams and VSP Design work together

VSP Design serves as a centralized design support team for all VFS teams, including teams working on Veteran-facing Services Applications (VSA), public website teams, and more.  

**Onboarding new teams**
- Your team will get a tour of how we approach UX! We’ll schedule a design breakout with you and team members to show you around the tools, services, support, and documentation available to you. 
- You’ll meet the people on VSP who specialize in design and research, content, information architecture, and accessibility

**During the discovery phase**
- Your team can use our templates, patterns, and guides to conduct user research, create prototypes, start crafting supporting content, and test all of this with real users.
- Your team can expect early feedback and direction on the work with a [Design Intent Check-in](#designintent),and can drop in throughout the process using [Platform Design Office Hours](#officehours).

**During the design and build phases**
- Your team will use the [sketch pattern library](https://design.va.gov/documentation/designers "sketch pattern library") to quickly design screen mockups in Sketch.  
- Your team can work from our research guides for usability testing, and update your content and features based on what you learn.
- The team will schedule [Design Reviews](#designreviews) as you build out your flows


## <a id="whatdoesVSPdesigndo"></a>What VSP design does
We support designers by providing resources and guidance to enable them to create excellent Veteran-centered experiences. 

### How can VSP Design help?

- Show you how we carry out research and design in support of VA.gov products.
- Provide resources for planning, recruiting, facilitating, and synthesizing research when you’re ready to conduct user research (discovery or usability).
- Design intent check-ins for an early mock, prototype, or flow before conducting usability testing **(this is required)**
- Identify design system components and patterns that are most appropriate for what your team is designing
- Conduct a pre-usability testing design review on prototypes or static screen, and a design QA review when the designs have been built on staging (coded, interactive flows) **(this is required)**
- Hold reviews and check-ins as needed when the design team iterates based on user feedback, new requirements, etc.

## <a id="whentorequest"></a>Design reviews
**There are 3 types of design reviews:**
1. **Design intent-check in** is conducted in the early stages of a project and provides direction, feedback, and research assistance. 
2. **Pre-usability testing design review** is conducted when the designs are built on static screens or prototypes and provides more specific feedback like relevant design system components and patterns, VA.gov URLS of relevant patterns in production, and staging server information and test user accounts.
3. **Design QA review** is conducted when design is on staging and provides a final look through of the built-out design. Ideally design is polished and discussed previously through prior reviews. We don't want to be making any major design changes at this stage. 

If you are a new designer on your first VA.gov project, or if you are a designer starting a large project from scratch (defining the problem, doing discovery research) you should go through each of the 3 types of design reviews.

For new designers: We would like you to to seek out lots of feedback throughout your first project so you can get to know the environment and work norms with lots of guidance - there is a lot to learn and we are here to help!

For designers beginning new, large projects from scratch: Something here to give reasons why they should go through all 3 steps.

For not-new designers working on small or medium projects: Use your judgment for what levels of support and feedback you need. Generally, a pre-usability testing design review or a design QA review will be appropriate for this type of project, but you are the expert!

## Design review timeline
- Assigned to project
- Project kickoff
- Research/discovery if needed
- **A design intent-check in**
- Take in feedback/direction build out user flows, mockups, prototypes
- **Pre-usability testing design review** 
- Incorporate feedback into prototype before testing
- Testing with users
- Iteration to incorporate user feedback
- Hand off to development to build
- **Design QA review** 

### <a id="designintent"></a>Design Intent Check-in
**When to request a design intent check-in:**  
We recommend requesting a design intent check-in before any high-fidelity designing takes place. This is the chance to lay out the problem space with the platform team and get guidance on inclusive design, and any existing patterns or flows that might be useful.  
Your designs should be in the early stages, like low-fidelity whiteboard or pencil sketches and/or wireframes.
- Everything doesn’t need to be perfect. We have an iterative design culture and encourage feedback early and often.
- Check the [design review guidelines](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/edit/master/platform/design/working-with-platform-design-team.md#things-to-keep-in-mind-when-designing-for-vagov "design review guidelines") for general areas of discussion we may cover before the meeting. Don’t stress out on parts of the design that aren’t totally fleshed out yet, the goal of this meeting is to confirm the overall direction and make sure you are putting your energy into the most impactful design problems.

**How to request a design intent check-in:**
You can slack Crystabel Reiter or Emily Waggoner on slack and they will schedule an in-person meeting. 
- During the meeting be prepared to provide full context on your design, i.e. lay out what problems you are solving, what you’ve learned so far (research, competitive analysis, etc), and what ideas you’re exploring for solutions. We will talk through any suggestions or feedback during the meeting and after, i.e. people to connect with who have worked on similar things, other research that has been done that might be useful to you, similar or required reusable flows on VA.gov, guidelines and patterns from the design system, etc.

### <a id="designreviews"></a>Design Reviews

**When to request a pre-usability testing design review:**
VFS teams should schedule the design review when the designs are ready to be tested with users (prototypes or static screens)

**When to request a design QA review:**
VFS teams should schedule the design QA review when designs have been built on staging (coded, interactive flows).

**<a id="howtorequest"></a>How to request a VSP design review**

**1. File an issue in va.gov-team repo.**
- Title: Request Design Review
- Labels:
    - design
    - product support
    - [your team's Github label], e.g., "BAH-526"
- Assign the issue to: Crystabel Reiter, Emily Waggoner, and Trevor Pierce
- Comment: Include the following information:
    - Context: Provide context for your team's project.
    - e.g., Functionality adds a new dataset to the Facility Locator so users can search for and view non-VA health providers on the map, as well as in list and detail views.
- URL or screenshots: link to your project prototype if you have one, or attach screenshots of each page, or paste a link to where it lives on staging
- New Design Patterns (if any): Note the places where you've created and used new design patterns (if any)
- Design Challenges (if any): Note any unusual or tricky design problems you needed to solve in this work
- TODO - *provide an example here.*

**2. Slack Crystabel Reiter or Emily Waggoner and let us know the issue was created. We will schedule an in-person review or will review asynchronously as we see fit.**

**3. Within 4 business days, VSP will conduct a Design Review using the [checklist at the bottom of this document.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/working-with-platform-design-team.md#things-to-keep-in-mind-when-designing-for-vagov)**
- If you don't hear anything after 4 business days, reach out to your Digital Experience & Product Office (DEPO) Contact.

**4. VSP will update the Github issue with screenshots to show where design needs to be changed.**

**5. Complete all the changes requested in the screenshots.**
- If your team has questions (or disagrees with a requested change), use the Github issue to discuss that with DEPO and VSP.

**6. When all changes are completed, close the issue.**

**7. When the issue is closed, this activity is considered complete.**

## <a id="otheropportunities"></a>Other ways to get VSP design feedback

The platform design team is also available for informal discussions about design challenges and we can help answer questions and point you in the right direction outside of the more formal design reviews and intent check-ins.

<a id="officehours"></a>**Platform Design Office Hours**  
Every Tuesday from 3-4pm ET, drop into Zoom to get a second set of eyes on your work, get some questions answered, or talk through any design challenges you’re experiencing. [Add the event to your calendar here.](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=ZDV1bzE3czUzb3U4cTA0YWlqbmRrOW40dDZfMjAyMDAyMTFUMTkwMDAwWiBlbWlseUBhZGhvY3RlYW0udXM&tmsrc=emily%40adhocteam.us&scp=ALL)

**Design + Content + Research sync**  
Every Monday from 1-2pm ET, anyone and everyone doing work related to UX design on VA.gov is invited to get together for an hour to show-and-tell, get feedback, share research, and collaborate on tough design problems. We plan the agenda ahead of time for this meeting, so let @Emily Waggoner know in Slack if you’d like to get on the list! [Add the event to your calendar here.](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=XzYwcTMwYzFnNjBvMzBlMWk2MG80YWMxZzYwcmo4Z3BsODhyajJjMWg4NHMzNGg5ZzYwczMwYzFnNjBvMzBjMWc2bDMzMGQxbTZncmo4aDltNzBxazhkOWc2NG8zMGMxZzYwbzMwYzFnNjBvMzBjMWc2MG8zMmMxZzYwbzMwYzFnNmtwNGNoOWs2NTIzaWMxbTY0c2o4aDlrNjkxMzZjaGw2dDJqZWhoZzc1MGpnZTFpOGNzZ18yMDE5MTExOFQxODAwMDBaIGVtaWx5QGFkaG9jdGVhbS51cw&tmsrc=emily%40adhocteam.us&scp=ALL)

**Design in the open    
We encourage all designers to be open about their process and seek feedback throughout every step. We are all working together to create excellent experiences for Veterans, and we are here to help each other along the way. Designers should share sketches and low-fi mockups of your work in the Slack #design channel. It’s a great way to get quick, asynchronous feedback and it helps to build a culture of transparency and openness.**
