# Working with VSP Design Rules of Engagement (ROE)


## How VFS teams and VSP Design work together 
**Onboarding**
- Get a tour of how we UX! We’ll show you around the tools, services, support, and documentation available to you. We will schedule a design breakout with you and team members 

**Discover**
- Use our templates, patterns, and guides to conduct user research, create prototypes, start crafting supporting content, and test all of this with real users  

**Build**
- Use the sketch pattern library to build out designs  
Use our research guides for user testing, and update your content and features based on what you learn. 

## Working with VSP Design
This document will help all teams working on VA.gov understand when you should engage VSP design resources for collaboration and support. All teams building on the Veteran-facing Services Platform (VSP) should follow VA.gov design best practices and guidelines. Working with the VSP design team can help ensure all designs communicate effectively and maintain a consistent design language and user experience across the site.

## <a id="whatdoesVSPdesigndo"></a>What does the VSP design team do
We support designers by providing resources and guidance to enable them to create excellent Veteran-centered experiences. 

### When can VSP Design help?

- Show you how we carry out research and design in support of VA.gov products.
- Provide resources for planning, recruiting, facilitating, and synthesizing research when you’re ready to conduct user research (discovery or usability).
- Design intent check-ins for an early mock, prototype, or flow before conducting usability testing **(this is required)**
- Conduct design reviews on prototypes or static screens, and when the designs have been built on staging (coded, interactive flows) **(2 design reviews are required)**
- Hold reviews and check-ins as needed when the design team iterates based on user feedback, new requirements, etc.

## <a id="whentorequest"></a>When to request VSP design resources
You can engage with the VSP Design team anytime throughout the design process. We strongly recommend  that you reach out earlier rather than later so we can give our input before development. After development and when the complete and final build is on staging, a design QA review will be scheduled. Instructions on how to request a design QA review is in the next section. 

**When performing user research**   
We can help facilitate user research, review research plans and conversation guides, and help connect you with the recruiting team.

**To review designs and/or prototypes**    
VFS teams can schedule a design review on work in progress or prototypes that you’re planning on testing. 

**After development** .   
VFS teams should schedule a design QA review session when the complete and final build is on staging.

## <a id="whentorequest"></a>How to request design reviews
**There are 2 types of design reviews:**
1. Design intent check-in 
2. Design Review

**When to request a design intent check-in:**  
Before any high-fidelity designing takes place to lay out the problem space with the platform team and get guidance on inclusive design, and any existing patterns or flows that might be useful.  
Your designs can be in the early stages like whiteboard or pencil sketches/low-fidelity or more built out, for example, mockups or prototypes. 
- Don’t feel like you have to have everything perfect. We have an iterative design culture and we’re encouraged to give feedback early and often. 
- Check the [design review guidelines](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-vfs-teams/blob/master/Request-Reviews/request-design-qa.md#design-qa-checklist "design review guidelines") for general requirements on your designs you should check before our meeting, but don’t stress out on parts of the design that aren’t totally fleshed out yet. 

**How to request a design intent check-in:**
These reviews are informal. You can slack Crystabel Reiter or Emily Waggoner on slack and they will schedule an in-person meeting. 
- During the meeting you can provide full context on your design and we can talk through any suggestions or feedback during the meeting and after.

**When to request a Design Review:**
VFS teams should schedule the Design Review when the designs are ready to be tested with users (prototypes or static screens), and when the designs have been built on staging (coded, interactive flows). You should be having at least 2 Design Reviews with the platform design team for each project, and they should not wait until the product is ready to launch.

## <a id="howtorequest"></a>How to request a design review:

**1. File an issue in va.gov-team repo.**
- Title: Request Design Review
- Labels:
    - design
    - product support
    - [your team's Github label], e.g., "BAH-526"
- Assign the issue to: Crystabel Reiter, Emily Waggoner, and Trevor Pierce
- Comment: Include the following information:
    - Context: Provide context for your team's project.
    - e.g., Functionality adds a new dataset to the Facility Locator so users can search for and view non-VA health providers on the map, as well as in list and detail views.
- URL or screenshots: link to your project prototype if you have one, or attach screenshots of each page, or paste a link to where it lives on staging
- New Design Patterns (if any): Note the places where you've created and used new design patterns (if any)
- Design Challenges (if any): Note any unusual or tricky design problems you needed to solve in this work
- TODO - *provide an example here.*

**2. Slack Crystabel Reiter or Emily Waggoner and let us know the issue was created. We will schedule an in-person review or will review asynchronously as we see fit.**

**3. Within 4 business days, VSP will conduct a Design Review using the [checklist at the bottom of this document.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/working-with-platform-design-team.md#things-to-keep-in-mind-when-designing-for-vagov)**
- If you don't hear anything after 4 business days, reach out to your DSVA Contact.

**4. VSP will update the Github issue with screenshots to show where design needs to be changed.**

**5. Complete all the changes requested in the screenshots.**
- If your team has questions (or disagrees with a requested change), use the Github issue to discuss that with DSVA and VSP.

**6. When all changes are completed, close the issue.**

**7. When the issue is closed, this activity is considered complete.**

## <a id="otheropportunities"></a>Other opportunities for feedback

The platform design team is also available for informal discussions about design challenges and we can help answer questions and point you in the right direction outside of the more formal design reviews and intent check-ins.

**Platform Design Office Hours**  
Every Tuesday from 3-4pm ET, drop into Zoom to get a second set of eyes on your work, get some questions answered, or talk through any design challenges you’re experiencing. [Add the event to your calendar here.](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=Nmx2aW5rczVhZXB0bTJwcTNoc2Z2ZGRnN2JfMjAxOTExMTJUMjAwMDAwWiBlbWlseUBhZGhvY3RlYW0udXM&tmsrc=emily%40adhocteam.us&scp=ALL)

**Design + Content + Research sync**  
Every Monday from 1-2pm ET, anyone and everyone doing work related to UX design on VA.gov is invited to get together for an hour to show-and-tell, get feedback, share research, and collaborate on tough design problems. We plan the agenda ahead of time for this meeting, so let @Emily Waggoner know in Slack if you’d like to get on the list! [Add the event to your calendar here.](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=XzYwcTMwYzFnNjBvMzBlMWk2MG80YWMxZzYwcmo4Z3BsODhyajJjMWg4NHMzNGg5ZzYwczMwYzFnNjBvMzBjMWc2bDMzMGQxbTZncmo4aDltNzBxazhkOWc2NG8zMGMxZzYwbzMwYzFnNjBvMzBjMWc2MG8zMmMxZzYwbzMwYzFnNmtwNGNoOWs2NTIzaWMxbTY0c2o4aDlrNjkxMzZjaGw2dDJqZWhoZzc1MGpnZTFpOGNzZ18yMDE5MTExOFQxODAwMDBaIGVtaWx5QGFkaG9jdGVhbS51cw&tmsrc=emily%40adhocteam.us&scp=ALL)

**Design in the open    
We encourage all designers to be open about their process and seek feedback throughout every step. We are all working together to create excellent experiences for Veterans, and we are here to help each other along the way. Designers should share sketches and low-fi mockups of your work in the Slack #design channel. It’s a great way to get quick, asynchronous feedback and it helps to build a culture of transparency and openness.**
