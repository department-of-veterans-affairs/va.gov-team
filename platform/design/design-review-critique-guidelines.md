# Design Review Critique Guidelines:
The purpose of these guidelines are for VSP practice area experts to give a standard framework of feedback so that VFS designers can understand what needs to be done, what needs to be explored, and what needs to be considered when incorporating VSP feedback into their designs. 

## Design Review Format: 
- **Collaboration points applicable:** Design Intent Collaboration, Usability Testing Prep, Staging Review

- **Anyone who is moderating the session:** Let the person receiving critique  introduce the problem they are trying to solve and any requirements they may be working with, and then go over their design. Make sure they state if they want a specific piece of feedback on any part of their design. (10-15 min max)

- **Note:** Designer should not give a full overview of their project because this happens in the Project Kickoff.

- Each reviewer has 5 minutes each to give initial feedback and then will add feedback later in a ticket related to the epic 

## Step 1: Analyze

Reviewers: For Usability Testing Prep and Staging Reviews, reviewers should look at the work before the meeting and have questions, notes, and feedback prepared ahead of time. The first thing you’ll need to do is analyze the work. See if anything stands out from the design as particularly effective or ineffective..  The goal of providing feedback is to talk about what can be improved AND what was done really well. Be empathetic, keep in mind to try to understand why the team did that in the first place.


A few questions that can help frame your thinking while analyzing:

- What is the goal of this project?

- What human problem is this trying to solve?

- How close is this design to achieving the goal?

- How do I feel about this in general through the lens of my expertise?

## Step 2: Write It Down

Write down your thoughts as you are analyzing the work so that you are prepared with actionable feedback when coming to the review. Organize your notes in the following way:

- Questions
- Things that stand out as very effective (good stuff!)
- Feedback
   - Do
   - Try
   - Consider

## How to Communicate Feedback:



### Do:

- **“Do” is used for mandatory feedback. It overrules the team, and so we use it very mindfully— just for times when a decision is hard to reverse and has a big impact on quality or system complexity, or contains a clear 508 violation, or departure from established patterns in the design system.** 
- “Do” means “this feedback is not optional”, not “Do this no matter what and don’t ask any questions”.


**Examples of “Do” feedback:**

- Change the focus state from the blue outline back to yellow
- Add the underlines back to the text links
- If something is not going to pass 508 office standards of accessibility 

### Try:

- The “try” feedback can have more of a suggested solution, since the team is fully empowered to take the feedback or not once they’ve explored it.

- **“Try” feedback is appropriate when you think the extra time for exploration is really worth it.**

**Examples of “Try” Feedback:**

- Try: Explore options for displaying the data, such as in a list, a table, or a card. 
- Try: See if we can solve this with an existing design pattern instead of inventing a new one

### Consider:
- **“Consider” is used to share ideas or alternate ways of thinking about a problem.** After thinking through the point briefly and responding, the team is empowered to take the feedback or not.

- When suggesting a direction, try to make it **solution-agnostic, which means the suggestion should not imply any sort of specific solution because you want to give a room for the team to explore.** At the same time, you have to be articulate, you have to be clear on what you think needs to be improved.

- By marking these ideas as “consider”, we make it clear exactly how optional the feedback is: it’s not just a random idea that the team can brush off without thinking about it, and it’s not so lightweight that it doesn’t need a response, but the team is fully empowered to respond however they want.
 
**Examples of “consider feedback:**

- Consider: Could we combine the two screens into one?
- Consider: Could we use a different form control for gathering that data?
- Consider: How might we make the entry point more discoverable?
- Consider: Does the button have a strong enough call to action?

### Step 3: Communicate it

- **During the meeting:** reviewers should use their 5 minutes to ask their questions, note items that are particularly effective, and deliver their feedback. If you don’t think 5 minutes will be enough time, prioritize your questions and do feedback, and come back to it if there’s time after everyone else has gone. 

- **After the meeting:** Before the end of the day, create an issue that captures your feedback and attach it to the collaboration point’s epic.
