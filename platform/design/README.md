## <a id="whatwedo"></a> What we do
VSP Design serves as a centralized design support team for all VFS teams, including teams working on Veteran-facing Services Applications (VSA), public website teams, and more.
- Show you how we carry out research and design in support of VA.gov products.
Provide resources for planning, recruiting, facilitating, and synthesizing research when you’re ready to conduct user research (discovery or usability).
- Identify design system components and patterns that are most appropriate for what your team is designing
- Collaborate at key points throughout the life cycle of a product to help connect you to relevant patterns and research and ensure consistency
- Hold reviews and check-ins as needed when the design team iterates based on user feedback, new requirements, etc.

### Orientation
During orientation, you’ll meet the people on VSP who specialize in design and research, content, information architecture, and accessibility and get a tour of how we approach UX. We’ll schedule a design breakout with you and team members to show you around the tools, services, support, and documentation available to you.

### VSP Collaboration Cycle
The [VSP Collaboration Cycle](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/vsp-collaboration-cycle/vsp-collaboration-cycle-visual.pdf) defines the process for VSP support of VFS teams to ensure that products and services on VA.gov are human-centered, reliable, and continually improving.
Design guidance is included as a standard in the following phases of the VSP Collaboration Cycle:

- **Define:** In the early stages of a project, we will meet in a Design Intent Collaboration meeting to provide you with direction regarding existing design components and research findings relevant to the problem space. 

- **Discover:** Usability testing prep collaboration happens when the designs are built on static screens or prototypes and provides more specific feedback like relevant design system components and patterns, VA.gov URLS of relevant patterns in production, and staging server information and test user accounts.

- **Build:** Staging review is conducted when design is on staging and provides a final look through of the built-out design. Ideally design is polished and discussed previously through prior reviews. We don't want to be making any major design changes at this stage.

Review the [Design checklist for usability testing prep and staging review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/design-checklist-for-usability-testing-and-staging-revi.md) to prepare your designs for the Usability testing prep collaboration and Staging review meetings. 
 
### Other ways to get VSP design feedback
We are also available for informal discussions about design challenges and can help answer questions outside of the formal collaboration within the VSP Collaboration Cycle:

- **Platform Design Office Hours**
Every Tuesday from 3-4pm ET, drop into Zoom to get a second set of eyes on your work, get some questions answered, or talk through any design challenges you’re experiencing. [Add the event to your calendar here](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=ZDV1bzE3czUzb3U4cTA0YWlqbmRrOW40dDZfMjAyMDAyMTFUMTkwMDAwWiBlbWlseUBhZGhvY3RlYW0udXM&tmsrc=emily%40adhocteam.us&scp=ALL).

- **Design + Content + Research sync**
Every Monday from 1-2pm ET, anyone and everyone doing work related to UX design on VA.gov is invited to get together for an hour to show-and-tell, get feedback, share research, and collaborate on tough design problems. We plan the agenda ahead of time for this meeting, so let @Emily Waggoner know in Slack if you’d like to get on the list! [Add the event to your calendar here](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=XzYwcTMwYzFnNjBvMzBlMWk2MG80YWMxZzYwcmo4Z3BsODhyajJjMWg4NHMzNGg5ZzYwczMwYzFnNjBvMzBjMWc2bDMzMGQxbTZncmo4aDltNzBxazhkOWc2NG8zMGMxZzYwbzMwYzFnNjBvMzBjMWc2MG8zMmMxZzYwbzMwYzFnNmtwNGNoOWs2NTIzaWMxbTY0c2o4aDlrNjkxMzZjaGw2dDJqZWhoZzc1MGpnZTFpOGNzZ18yMDE5MTExOFQxODAwMDBaIGVtaWx5QGFkaG9jdGVhbS51cw&tmsrc=emily%40adhocteam.us&scp=ALL).

- **Design in the open**
We encourage all designers to be open about their process and seek feedback throughout every step. Designers should share sketches and low-fi mockups of your work in the Slack #design channel. It’s a great way to get quick, asynchronous feedback and it helps to build a culture of transparency and openness.
