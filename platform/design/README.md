## <a id="whatwedo"></a> What we do
Platform Design serves as a centralized design support team for all VFS teams, including teams working on Veteran-facing Services Applications (VSA), public website teams, and more.
- Show you how we carry out research and design in support of VA.gov products.
Provide resources for planning, recruiting, facilitating, and synthesizing research when you’re ready to conduct user research (discovery or usability).
- Identify design system components and patterns that are most appropriate for what your team is designing
- Collaborate at key points throughout the life cycle of a product to help connect you to relevant patterns and research and ensure consistency
- Hold reviews and check-ins as needed when the design team iterates based on user feedback, new requirements, etc.

### Orientation
Come to the Design Orientation session where you’ll meet the people on the Platform who specialize in design and research, content, information architecture, and accessibility and get a tour of how we approach UX. We’ll show you around the tools, services, support, and documentation available to you. [Sign up for the next design orientation session](https://calendly.com/collaboration-cycle/design-orientation-for-va-gov-platform?month=2022-01)

### Platform Collaboration Cycle
The [Platform Collaboration Cycle](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/vsp-collaboration-cycle/vsp-collaboration-cycle-visual.pdf) defines the process for Platform support of VFS teams to ensure that products and services on VA.gov are human-centered, reliable, and continually improving.
Design guidance is included as a standard in the following phases of the Platform Collaboration Cycle:

- **Define:** In the early stages of a project, we will meet in a Design Intent Collaboration meeting to provide you with direction regarding existing design components and research findings relevant to the problem space. 

- **Discover:** A Midpoint review happens when the designs are built on static screens or prototypes and provides more specific feedback like relevant design system components and patterns, VA.gov URLS of relevant patterns in production, and staging server information and test user accounts.

- **Build:** Staging review is conducted when design is on staging and provides a final look through of the built-out design. Ideally design is polished and discussed previously through prior reviews. We don't want to be making any major design changes at this stage.

Review the [Design checklist for midpoint review and staging review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/design-checklist-for-usability-testing-and-staging-revi.md) to prepare your designs for the Midpoint review and Staging review meetings. 
 
### Other ways to get Platform design feedback
We are also available for informal discussions about design challenges and can help answer questions outside of the formal collaboration within the Platform Collaboration Cycle:

- **Platform Design Office Hours**
Every Tuesday from 2:30-3:30pm ET, drop into Zoom to get a second set of eyes on your work, get some questions answered, or talk through any design challenges you’re experiencing. [Add the event to your calendar here](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=ZTIwYTc5cWExbmdkcXR1NGpxNG1vNmZkNnBfMjAyMTAzMDlUMTkzMDAwWiBuYW9taS5tYXJjdXNzZW5Ab2RkYmFsbC5pbw&tmsrc=naomi.marcussen%40oddball.io&scp=ALL).

- **Design + Content + Research sync**
Every Monday from 1-2pm ET, anyone and everyone doing work related to UX design on VA.gov is invited to get together for an hour to show-and-tell, get feedback, share research, and collaborate on tough design problems. We plan the agenda ahead of time for this meeting, so let @Naomi Marcussen know in Slack if you’d like to get on the list! [Add the event to your calendar here](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=XzYwcTMwYzFnNjBvMzBlMWk2MG80YWMxZzYwcmo4Z3BsODhyajJjMWg4NHMzNGg5ZzYwczMwYzFnNjBvMzBjMWc2bDMzMGQxbTZncmo4aDltNzBxazhkOWc2NG8zMGMxZzYwbzMwYzFnNjBvMzBjMWc2MG8zMmMxZzYwbzMwYzFnNmtwNGNoOWs2NTIzaWMxbTY0c2o4aDlrNjkxMzZjaGw2dDJqZWhoZzc1MGpnZTFpOGNzZ18yMDE5MTExOFQxODAwMDBaIGVtaWx5QGFkaG9jdGVhbS51cw&tmsrc=emily%40adhocteam.us&scp=ALL).

- **Design in the open**
We encourage all designers to be open about their process and seek feedback throughout every step. Designers should share sketches and low-fi mockups of your work in the Slack #design channel. It’s a great way to get quick, asynchronous feedback and it helps to build a culture of transparency and openness.
