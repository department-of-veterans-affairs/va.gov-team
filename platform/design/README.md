# Previous Readme Content From Deprecated 'Work Practices' Folder
The content in this folder was made with love by multiple generations of our UX team with special attention from your friendly UX Leads: Emily Wright-Moore, Suzanne Chapman, and Lauren Alexanderson.

*Current maintainer of this directory: Lauren Alexanderson*

This folder includes design resources, processes & guidance, and information about the design practice. It does NOT include design components or research components for specific products. You should find those in the appropriate product folder. 

## Getting started

Welcome to the team! If all has gone well, you've made it through our [main onboarding section](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/working-with-vsp/orientation) and you're ready to start working in your practice area. This should help you get started. 

## Onboarding: Are you new or need a refresher of all the basic things? 
- [UX Onboarding talking points](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/uxonboarding.md)

## Practice Area Schedule
- Monday 1pm Full Team: join.me/vetsdotgov-design; Design & Research Crits, Demos, Readouts, and Discussions 

## [Tools We Use](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/design-resources/designtools.md)
*If you need to be invited to an account or need a license for a tool reach out to Alex Taylor or Lauren Alexanderson.*
- **Slack**: All conversations about products should take place in the appropriate DSVA product channel, not a private DM, an AdHoc only, or DSVA only channel. 
  - Bring any design questions for your fellow designers to the **#design** channel. 
  - Bring any research questions to the **#vetsdotgov-research** channel. 
- **GitHub**: Both for code and for storing #allthethingz. This is our knowledge management system too, so document everything!   
  - Your research process should be documented end-to-end in a [research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/research-plan-template.md) stored in your product folder. When you're done with research, add your study & the link to your research folder to the [Research History](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/research-history.md)   - Your [design decisions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/design) should also be documented in your product folder; upload and store design files, link to prototypes and templates.  
- **Join.me**: We conduct our meetings on join.me/vetsdotgov-design. If you need to use the design channel at times when we don't have meetings check with Alex Taylor or Lauren Alexanderson. You can also use join.me to conduct some types of research sessions, if you don't need the user to interact with a prototype. 
- **Sketch**: We use Sketch to design. There is a Sketch pattern library (see links below). Don't create new patterns without checking with the manager of the design system (currently: Sophia Dengo). 
- **InVision**: We use InVision to create prototypes for testing, demos to stakeholders, etc. 
- **Ripple**: Ripple is our Veteran database for research. We also have other options to recruit Veterans. Check with research & UX lead (Lauren Alexanderson). 
- **GoToMeeting**: This is the tool we use to conduct remote research sessions. Requires you to have the desktop version to use. Review the [GoToMeeting Instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/research/during-research) before you use it. Check in with Lauren before booking research sessions on it to make sure you're not overlapping with someone else. 
- **Optimal Workshop**: This is a research tool you can use to conduct card sorts, tree tests, or unmoderated prototype tests. You can also use the Reframer tool within Optimal Workshop to synthesize research. 
- **Handrail**: This tool facilitates notetaking during research sessions and synthesis.
- **Mural**: This is a great group brainstorming tool. Can be used to map out a userflow, conduct remote post-it synthesis, etc. 
- **Trello**: Trello is a free tool that can also be used to [conduct remote synthesis with your team](https://builttoadapt.io/using-trello-for-user-research-synthesis-fb1abdfc7c4b).

- [Research process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/research-process.md): This is the process that every team should follow for research. Research should be led by a designer. 
- [Research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/research-plan-template.md): Designers should fill out this research plan as they think through their upcoming research. 
- [Research history](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/research-history.md) - This is perpetually a work in progress. If you see something missing, add it! 

### Design
- [Formation Design System](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/design-system/index.html): This is our "single source of truth" for design. If you have questions about a pattern or need to add one, please talk to Sophia Dengo and/or bring it up in the #design channel! 

### Graphic Resources
- [Formation Design System](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/design-system/index.html): *Repeating this, because it should be your first point of reference.* This is our "single source of truth" for design. If you have questions about a pattern or need to add one, please talk to Sophia Dengo and/or bring it up in the #design channel! 
- [Sketch Pattern Library](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/design/design-resources/pattern-library): A tool for designers to create hi-fidelity mockups of features on Vets.gov. It also serves as documentation of the styles and components that make up Vets.gov, as well as basic guidelines for the design system.

### How to Run Vets.gov Locally on Your Computer
Maybe you want to test a design in code or create a prototype. One way to do that is to set up Vets.gov to run locally on your computer. If you want help setting it up, reach out to Liz Hunt!
