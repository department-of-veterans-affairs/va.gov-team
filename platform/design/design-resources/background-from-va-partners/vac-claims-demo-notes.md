  - - Each question page by page, usability principles state this is too long, going to put on single page (no feedback yet)
    - Have chance to review/edit before moving on to step 4
  - Third party consent form
  - Spouse/demographic information
  - - Only asks these questions if your account doesn’t have this information
  - Dependents
  - Review application 
- “If you can categorize the answers its easier for people who adjudicate the claim as well”

    - - Causes further delays, redacted information
  - Scheduling appointments
  - - Different health insurance rules = puts responsibility on the veteran to get exams to support their claims
    - rely on external sources to provide a diagnosis for claims
