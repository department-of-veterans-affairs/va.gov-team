# VA.gov form design process

**Stakeholders:** Form owner, subject matter experts, VA employees processing form, VA employees that help Veterans to complete the form

**Users**: Veterans, family members, VA employees that help Veterans to complete the form

### What is the form?

- Review paper form, in detail
  - Is the form currently being revised by the owner?
- If it exists, review digital form, in detail
  - Create detailed flow diagram using screenshots of each decision point
- Create comparison spreadsheet of fields
- Document all (or relevant) content
- [Stakeholder Interviews] Identify elements of offline experience
  - What kind of communication or followup happens after the form?
  - Can the Veteran find out anything about their status, results, etc. through another online source?

### How does this form process work?

- [Stakeholder Interviews] Understand backend and human processes
  - Identify constraints for how data needs to be collected based on backend process
- [Stakeholder Interviews] Prod for how fields are used in processing: computer, human or otherwise
  - Look for things that are a greater burden on the applicant than they a time saver to VA employees
  - Look for ways the form could be tweaked to easily relieve burden from VA employees
    - Document these decisions. Why, who, etc.
  - Are there any work-arounds being employed to process the forms now?
- Note confusing form fields
- Identify related and potentially dependent questions

### Who uses the form?

- [Stakeholder Interviews] Identify use cases for the form. Who and why.
- [User Interviews] Interview form users to identify paint points (Commonly: Which form? What does this question mean? When do I fill out the form? How am I supposed to hear back?)
- [User Interviews] Note work arounds that applicants commonly use to complete the form

### Confirm scope

- Use design review process to confirm that functionality identified as out of scope is truly non-critical to the success of the form process.

### How should the form work?

- Create an outline for each required chapter
  - Identify field types
  - Identify dependent questions
- Create punchlist of copy needs (Many of the field level elements may be straightforward or direct copies from other forms)
- If new interactions are required, note these with development team and work on high fidelity mocks of what this new pattern would look like.
  - Get feedback from design team
  - Check with core team to make sure new patterns aren't reinventing the wheel
  - Test new pattern if necessary
- Think about entry and exit points for the form
  - Does your form require changes to navigation?
  - Is related static content up to date? 
  - Are there any other places you should be able to get to the form from?

### Usability Testing

- Use the live prototype to test the form process with applicants
  - identify unclear language
  - check whether new patterns are working
- Iterate
- Test again if necessary
