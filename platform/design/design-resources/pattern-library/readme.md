### Narrative
The VA.gov Sketch pattern library is a tool for designers to create high-fidelity mockups of features on VA.gov. It also serves as documentation of the styles and components that make up VA.gov, as well as basic guidelines for the design system.

[Formation](https://design.va.gov/), VA.gov's design system, should be your primary source of truth for design patterns. Emily Waggoner is in charge of making sure that the Sketch pattern library matches Formation.

### Current status
The Sketch pattern library is updated on an ongoing basis as new patterns and changes to existing patterns are developed. The latest version is always uploaded and available on [design.va.gov](https://design.va.gov/downloads/VA-gov-Pattern-Library.sketch) and on the [Sketch Cloud](https://sketch.cloud/s/8WM9O). 

The pattern library file contains a page called `Changelog` which outlines the updates that have been made to the file in each release.

**Note:** The Sketch Cloud URL is not currently accessible on the VA network, but is useful for anyone who doesn't have access to this private repo, such as external platform team designers or designers seeking open source resources.

#### A note about Sketch versions
The current Sketch pattern library was built using Sketch version 51.3, which is notably not the latest version of Sketch. This is because Sketch 51.3 is the oldest known version of Sketch in use on some designers' government-furnished equipment. We discovered in the Spring of 2019 that there were some compatibility problems for designers using an older version of Sketch to open a file created in the latest version. This was resolved by re-creating the pattern library in version 51.3, which doesn't present any compatibility issues when opened in newer versions of Sketch.

It’s important that the file is compatible with the oldest version of Sketch that designers are using. When the pattern library file is updated, it must be updated in Sketch version 51.3 which is [available for download here](https://www.sketch.com/updates/#version-51.3).
