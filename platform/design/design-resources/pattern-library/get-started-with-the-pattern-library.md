# Get started with the VA.gov Pattern Library

## Purpose

The VA.gov Sketch pattern library is a tool for designers to create hi-fidelity mockups of features on VA.gov. It also serves as documentation of the styles and components that make up VA.gov, as well as basic guidelines for the design system.

[Formation](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/design-system/index.html), VA.gov's design system, should be your primary source of truth for design patterns. Emily Waggoner is in charge of making sure that the Sketch pattern library matches Formation. 

## Getting started

Download the latest version of the [va-gov-pattern-library.sketch](/Practice%20Areas/Design/Design%20Resources/Pattern%20Library/VA-gov-Pattern-Library.sketch)

Important: whenever you start a new file, make sure to pull the latest version!

**Using this file as a Library**: Sketch has a feature that allows any file's symbols to be shared as a library to any other file. This is a handy way to use the VA.gov Sketch Pattern Library because it can keep your working file separate from the library, and ensure that you have the most up-to-date components. [More instructions to come]

**Fonts**: The pattern library uses [3 fonts](/Practice%20Areas/Design/Design%20Resources/Pattern%20Library/vets-fonts.md), download and install them.

The Sketch file is divided into four pages: Mockups, Templates, Styles, and Symbols

- **Mockups** is a space to create your mockups. Artboards from the Templates page can be copied here as a starting point for your mockups.
- **Templates** contains basic layouts in 3 device breakpoints for commonly used page templates. **12/19/18 note: Updates coming to the Templates section**
- **Styles** contains VA.gov style guide information and examples of core components. This is your sticker sheet to grab components to use in your mockups.
- **Symbols** contains components that have been made into Sketch symbols for easy & consistent use. You shouldn't need to look at this page unless you're creating or editing an existing symbol (more on that later).

In most cases you'll be working directly in the Mockups page, and only copying artboards and components as needed from Templates and Styles. The Symbols page can be ignored, as all the symbols are present and easier to find on the Styles page.

## Document setup

### Grid

All artboards in the Templates page contain the appropriate grid layout (use `crtl + L` to show/hide the layout per artboard).

### Colors

All colors are saved as a solid fill layer style and a document color. 

If the document colors do not appear, you can download the [Sketch Palettes plugin](https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes) and use it to load [vets-gov-colors.sketchpalette](/Practice%20Areas/Design/Design%20Resources/Pattern%20Library/vets-gov-colors.sketchpalette) to your document.

### Typography

All typography patterns (H1, H2, body, link, etc) are saved as text styles.

## Working with components

Components can be copied from the Styles page to be used in mockups. Components that have a fairly static layout are saved as Sketch symbols, and can also be added through the Symbol menu.

Some symbol components contain nested symbols that can be overridden for additional control over the state of a component. An example is the button symbol, which can be used to switch a button from a primary to secondary style, change the state (e.g. hover) and include icons in the label, in addition to changing the label text itself.

## Working with templates

Templates provide a starting point for your mockups. The artboards in the Templates page provide common page types in VA.gov, and can be copied for use in your Mockups page.

Each template type is represented in desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints to demonstrate the basic responsive behavior for its component parts.
