# Vets.gov Digital Service Design Tools 


## Communication
NO Google Drive allowed. Like, for real. 
- **Slack**: All conversations about products should take place in the appropriate product channel. Don't use private DM, contractor only, or VA only channels unless there is a **really** good reason. 
  - Bring any design questions for your fellow designers to the [#design](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/design) channel. 
  - Bring any research questions to the [#vetsdotgov-research](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/vetsdotgov-research) channel. 
- **GitHub**: Both for code and for storing #allthethingz. This is our knowledge management system too, so document everything!   - Your research process should be documented end-to-end in a [research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/research-plan-template.md) stored in your product folder. When you're done with research, add your study & the link to your research folder to the [Research History](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/research-history.md)     
- Your [design decisions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/design) should also be documented in your product folder; upload and store design files, link to prototypes and templates.  
- **Zoom.com**: We conduct our weekly meetings on Zoom. Naomi Marcussen or Kevin Hoffman will post the link weekly.

## Mockups, wireframes, sketches
_Ask your UX Lead about access to these tools_
- **Sketch**: We use Sketch for Teams to view, share, and collaborate on our work. Sketch for Teams works very similar to “normal” Sketch, but contains a few big features that help teams work together:
  - Files (including libraries) live in the cloud, rather than locally on your machine
  - You can see what everyone else is doing
  - You receive Library updates automagically
  - Developers can inspect any element on a page, anytime
[Learn how to setup Sketch for Teams](https://design.va.gov/documentation/designers#sketch-for-teams-at-va)

- **VA.gov Pattern Library**: You can access the library in Sketch for Teams. If you find you aren't able to get the job done with existing patterns, you can contribute to the design system by [suggesting a new component](https://design.va.gov/documentation/contributing-to-the-design-system). Check with the manager of the design system if you have questions (currently: Ryan Thurlwell). 

- _Creative Cloud_ (subscription, monthly fee on your own)
  - Photoshop
  - Illustrator
  - XD
  - InDesign

## Prototyping
- Pen and Paper totally works!
- Keynote / Powerpoint
  - fast but low-fidelity
- InVision (Free!)
  - good for mobile
  - account admin is Nancy Smith
- HTML/CSS (Free!)
  - for higher fidelity prototypes that will become applications
- Mural (for brainstorming, mapping, and comparative analysis)
  - account admin is Nancy Smith

## Front-End frameworks
- Foundation
- US Web Design Standards
- [VA styleguide & Pattern Library](design.va.gov)
  - A combination of Foundation, USWDS and our internal style 

## Print
- Creative Cloud 
  - InDesign 
    - for (documents, document templates, research, presentation - things that need to look very presentable)
    - consider using keynote instead

## Presentation
- Keynote
- PowerPoint

## User Research and Usability Testing
- **GoToMeeting**: This is the tool we use to conduct remote research sessions. Requires you to have the desktop version to use. Review the [GoToMeeting Instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/research/during-research) before you use it. Check in with Lauren before booking research sessions on it to make sure you're not overlapping with someone else. 
- **Optimal Workshop**: This is a research tool you can use to conduct card sorts, tree tests, or unmoderated prototype tests. You can also use the Reframer tool within Optimal Workshop to synthesize research. 
  - Alex Taylor is account owner
- **Mural**: This is a great group brainstorming tool. Can be used to conduct remote post-it synthesis, etc. 
- **Trello**: Trello is a free tool that can also be used to [conduct remote synthesis with your team](https://builttoadapt.io/using-trello-for-user-research-synthesis-fb1abdfc7c4b).
