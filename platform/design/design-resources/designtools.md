# Vets.gov Digital Service Design Tools 


## Communication
NO Google Drive allowed. Like, for real. 
- **Slack**: All conversations about products should take place in the appropriate product channel. Don't use private DM, contractor only, or VA only channels unless there is a **really** good reason. 
  - Bring any design questions for your fellow designers to the [#design](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/design) channel. 
  - Bring any research questions to the [#vetsdotgov-research](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/vetsdotgov-research) channel. 
- **GitHub**: Both for code and for storing #allthethingz. This is our knowledge management system too, so document everything!   - Your research process should be documented end-to-end in a [research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/research-plan-template.md) stored in your product folder. When you're done with research, add your study & the link to your research folder to the [Research History](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/research-history.md)     
- Your [design decisions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/design) should also be documented in your product folder; upload and store design files, link to prototypes and templates.  
- **Zoom.com**: We conduct our weekly meetings on Zoom. Naomi Marcussen or Kevin Hoffman will post the link weekly.

## Mockups, wireframes, sketches
_Ask your UX Lead about access to these tools_
- **Sketch**: We use Sketch to design. There is a [Sketch pattern library](https://design.va.gov/documentation/code-and-design). If you find you aren't able to get the job done with existing patterns, check with the manager of the design system (currently: Ryan Thurlwell). 
- _Creative Cloud_ (subscription, monthly fee on your own)
  - Photoshop
  - Illustrator
  - XD
  - InDesign

- Pen and Paper totally works!
- Keynote / Powerpoint
  - fast but low-fidelity
- InVision (Free!)
  - good for mobile
  - account admin is Nancy Smith
- HTML/CSS (Free!)
  - for higher fidelity prototypes that will become applications
- Mural (for brainstorming, mapping, and comparative analysis)
  - account admin is Nancy Smith

## Front-End frameworks
- Foundation
- US Web Design Standards
- [VA styleguide & Pattern Library](design.va.gov)
  - A combination of Foundation, USWDS and our internal style

    - for (documents, document templates, research, presentation - things that need to look very presentable)
    - consider using keynote instead

## Presentation

## User Research and Usability Testing
- **GoToMeeting**: This is the tool we use to conduct remote research sessions. Requires you to have the desktop version to use. Review the [GoToMeeting Instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/research/during-research) before you use it. Check in with Lauren before booking research sessions on it to make sure you're not overlapping with someone else. 
- **Optimal Workshop**: This is a research tool you can use to conduct card sorts, tree tests, or unmoderated prototype tests. You can also use the Reframer tool within Optimal Workshop to synthesize research. 
  - Alex Taylor is account owner
- **Mural**: This is a great group brainstorming tool. Can be used to conduct remote post-it synthesis, etc. 
- **Trello**: Trello is a free tool that can also be used to [conduct remote synthesis with your team](https://builttoadapt.io/using-trello-for-user-research-synthesis-fb1abdfc7c4b).
