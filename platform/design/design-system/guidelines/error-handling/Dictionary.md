## System messaging

Alerts the user of important system-related issues or status. It’s initiated by the system and it’s not a result of the user’s actions.

***Note:** See [content style guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Platform/Design%20System/Guidelines/Error%20handling/Content%20Style%20Guide.md#next-step-calls-to-action) for guidance on when to consider adding instruction to call the VA.gov help desk or other "next-step" call to action.*

| Action required (e.g. claim evidence request) | **We need your help to finish reviewing your claim** | Please provide more evidence (supporting documents) so we can finish reviewing your claim.| See Details | Alert | Warning | Above affected component |
| Form prefill notice                      | **We've started your form for you** | We've filled in some of this form based on information you've given us in the past. Please double-check the information and update it as needed. | - | Alert | Informational | Above affected component |
| Change in application feature, neutral/positive impact (e.g. SiP now available) | **You can now save your in-progress applications** | Sign in to VA.gov to save your application so you can come back later to complete it. All you'll need to sign in is an email and password. | Sign in to VA.gov | Alert | Informational | Above affected component |

## Engagement messaging

Nudges the user to enter or update data in the system. It can be initiated by either the system or another user.

***Note:** See [content style guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Platform/Design%20System/Guidelines/Error%20handling/Content%20Style%20Guide.md#next-step-calls-to-action) for guidance on when to consider adding instruction to call the VA.gov help desk or other "next-step" call to action.*

### Prompt to complete a task or enter data

| Scenario                                 | Title | Description | Actions | Component | State  | Location |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----- | ----------- | ------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| Continue a saved benefit application | **Still want to apply for [BENEFIT NAME]?** | The application you started for [BENEFIT NAME] will expire on [EXPIRATION DATE]. If you'd still like to apply, you'll need to submit the application by this date. Or you can start a new application any time. | [BUTTON 1] Continue your application [BUTTON 2] Start over | Alert | Informational | Replace affected component |
| Set up 2-factor authentication       | **Want to make your VA.gov account more secure?** | You can add an optional extra layer of security (called 2-factor authentication) to your account. This helps to make sure that no one but you can access your account—even if someone gets your password. | Secure your account | Alert | Informational | Replace affected component |

## Access messaging

Appears when the user tries to access an item that’s not available to them. It may be because the record has been deleted, the user doesn’t have access, etc.

***Note:** See [content style guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Platform/Design%20System/Guidelines/Error%20handling/Content%20Style%20Guide.md#next-step-calls-to-action) for guidance on when to consider adding instruction to call the VA.gov help desk or other "next-step" call to action.*

### System downtime

Variations in messaging will be contingent on:

- Whether or not the downtime is scheduled/expected
- If scheduled, when the application will be back up (precise time stamp if known, general estimate if not)
- If not expected, general estimate of when the application will be back up
