# User Experience Goals

**Unified:** develop a holistic strategy for providing feedback to users more broadly, not just error messaging

**Empathetic:** provide appropriate visual representation that matches the type of feedback

- In many scenarios a warning (yellow) is overkill and would be better as informational (blue) or plain text
- Develop a strategy that is considerate of the fact that seeing errors triggers a stress response

**Consistent**: set expectations for how, when, and where feedback appears

- Above/below page title, in place of unavailable content, width differences, etc
- When should feedback be shown as an overlay?
- When should an alert be dismissable vs. collapsible vs. permanent?

**Accurate:** in the event of an issue, provide the best resolution to the situation

- Detail — provide the right amount of information that's useful to the user and in plain language
- Timing for access issues — should I refresh, wait a couple hours, or wait a couple days?
- Assistance — in which cases can someone (or something) else help me, who is it, how do I contact them?
