# Kickoff meeting

## Problem statement

Error messages for the products across Vets.gov have been implemented in silos, and without a whole lot of planning around how they convey next steps/resolution to the user. Now that the site is maturing, we need a consistent strategy and implementation of error messaging across products in order to:

- Have a pattern for new product builds, thereby reducing time spent on error messaging for new products
- Provide dependable user flow from: try to access something, get an error, get help, get problem resolved (which, depending upon the error, may include flow from site to contact center)
- Provide consistent user experience for errors throughout the site

## What do we want to accomplish?

- Develop patterns where regardless of product whenever we get [x] response from backend there's a standard message
  - e.g. "call help desk" messaging should be the same message everywhere
  - Create an error dictionary
- Help the help desk resolve issues more quickly without a negative impact on users
  - More granular messaging?
  - Error codes that the help desk can use?
  - Can we help them uncover data mismatch issues? **<— longer-term goal, not for Dec**
- Develop stock fallback error messaging for major error codes
- Limit scope of backend work to only what the front-end requires to meet UX needs

## Approach

- Capture the current state
  - Audit the current state of errors across all products how we're handling them from a code, content, and UI perspective
- Define the desired state
  - Determine methods to handle errors for optimal visual presentation, voice and tone, and issue resolution
  - Develop a set of guidelines for teams to use to implement this standard
- Define the change process
  - Think about how and when teams can revisit and standardize error messaging in our current products
  - Add error message implementation as a process step in new product development (launch checklist?)
