# Forms Library

### Description

The Vets.gov team has forked and customized an open-source library called [react-jsonschema-form](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form) for use on Vets.gov. This has enabled us to increase the speed at which we build online forms significantly.

There is potential for this library to be abstracted out of the Vets.gov codebase and used by other teams across government to help them build their online forms. Our team is exploring ways in which we can improve the library for our own use as well as make it publicly available for any team to use.

This directory contains documentation on the phases of work for this project, both from a Vets.gov perspective as well as more generally, and any other materials needed to complete this work.
