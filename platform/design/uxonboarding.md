# Welcome to the Veteran Facing Services UX team!
Hi there. This document is specifically for UX (design, content, research) folks joining the Vets.gov team and is intended to be an outline of topics to be discussed with the UX Lead during your first couple of weeks.  

## First & second
- We're so happy you've joined!
- Onboarding at a federal agency is surprisingly hard and annoying. Just know this is "normal" and we're sorry. It will serve you well to approach it as an empathy building experience. If it's this hard to start work here, imagine what it's like to be injured, stressed, and wading through thousands of webpages and forms to figure out how to get life changing benefits you earned the hardest way possible. This is why we're here.

## Who we are
### USDS > Digital Service @ VA (DSVA) > Veteran Facing Services
- Veteran Facing Services team is one of a few DSVA teams (the others are focused on Appeals modernization, cloud, homelessness) 
- Includes USDS via HQ, USDS via VA, AdHoc contractors, and AdHoc subcontractors.
- DSVA team started around Jan 2015. Vets.gov beta launched Nov 2015. Vets.gov brand consolidated with VA.gov launched November 2018. ([timeline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/digitalservice/blob/b8b888e1e15fce0622367186bc59d99ccd7d5d31/5.%20DSVAhistory.md) available for DSVA members).
- [Official USDS values](https://www.usds.gov/values.html) apply to everyone

## What we do
### Our mission
- Official mission statement: VA.gov enables Veterans to discover, apply for, track, and manage the benefits they've earned.
- VA.gov aims to be the new home for all Veteran-facing, transactional services, under one roof (as opposed to the hundreds of websites Veterans currently have to navigate). We are also working to merge with VA.gov to bring the work to-date to a much bigger audience.
- Mix of migration and new tools and features.

## How we work
### Very important things to keep in mind
- Be thoughtful, generous, respectful. 
- Every single person on this team is here for the right reasons so be careful not to loose site of that.
- No mansplaining. No cutting other people off.
- Assume past decisions by DSVA were made thoughtfully and with difficult tradeoffs in mind. Everything is harder than you think it should be so we're often forced to go with the least shitty solution. However, new people often bring a wonderful new perspective so don't hesitate to ask questions -- just approach from a neutral and inquisitive place. Alex Talyor's rule of thumb = if you find yourself thinking "why don't we just...", it's probably time to adjust your attitude. And remember, one day you'll be the old timer on the team that some new person is wondering why _you_ did some weird thing!
- When entering a project mid-stream, avoid critiquing until you understand how we got there. It's helpful to ask:
    - What's the problem we're trying to solve?
    - What's been done so far?
    - What does the rest of the team think about where we are now?
- The same goes for how we work. We do have a lot of processes in place that work well, some maybe don't work well. If you have an idea for how to make something work better, great!
- When working with VA stakeholders or legacy systems, assume the best intentions. They've been trying to make things better long before we got here. It's important to bring them along and be respectful of what came before us.  Always assume someone smart and well meaning worked on the thing you're aiming to improve.
- The same goes for how we work. We do have a lot of processes in place that work well, some that don't. If you have an idea for how to make something (team structure, processes, methods, meetings, etc.) work better, great! Talk to the UX Lead or your sprint team lead. The better we work as a team, the more awesome things we get to make! 

### Team structures & "reporting lines"
- Your priority is to support the work of the sprint team you're assigned to
- Your friendly UX Lead
  - Oversees all things related to research, design, and content
  - Assigns new UX team members to their team / moves people when we have to load balance
  - Does not oversee daily tasks (but may assign work when sprint teams don't have enough work or one-off projects need assistance)
  - Gives feedback on designs and big decisions to help solve problems and ensure consistency and quality
  - Nudges, encourages, enforces good practices, and makes difficult UX calls when needed
  - Can help resolve any issue and conflict
  - Tries to anticipate cross-project and future needs
 
### Being remote or working with remote people
 - Default to overcommunicating
 - Take advantage of join.me (in particular video)
 - Sit in on remote user research sessions
 - Help recruit user research participants in your area
 - Find time to reachout and just chat with people

### Recurring meetings
 - Sprint team meetings: Your team lead and product manager will send you these. Expect standups most days, and weekly backlog grooming or sprint planning. 
 - Teamwide meetings: Your team lead (Marvo for DSVA or Elizabeth & Rachael for Ad Hoc) will send you these. Expect biweekly demos, monthly deep dives.

  
### Communication & documentation
In general, default to text-based tools for internal communications for ease of finding and updating (ie. choose github markdown over Word files and PPTs; only use slack posts for temporary or private docs)

Aim for a medium level of documentation (not exhaustive and not minimal). Document key information that will be useful to our future selves and our wonderful future team members who may need to look back to understand project goals, key research findings, what areas need additiona attention, why we made some weird decision, etc. 

Leave things better than how you found them (it’s everyone’s responsibility to improve documentation).

Communication goals: transparancy now, paper trail for future version of the team

(AdHoc designers: all communication about the work should be done in DSVA slack, NOT Adhoc's slack)

- Slack
  - join channels as you desire (team, design, extras)
  - use for conversations (threads for micro convos)
  - Only use DMs when it truly needs to be private or you’re just working out logistics for a meeting or something no one else needs to see
  - Channels shouldn't be private 
- Github
  - most of your work (or requests to others for work) should be connected to an issue or product folder
  - Decisions made in slack conversations should be documented in GH
  - Planning, notes, documentation should be in an md file
  - Research documentation and design decisions should be stored in appropriate research folder within product folder. 
  - Cross-link any research to the research history
- Email
  - Ideally only used when communicating with people outside the DSVA team, such as stakeholders

*** **Note: all 3 above communication tools are subject to FOIA**

#### Slack tips and tricks

## How we UX

### In general
- Design, research, content, accessibility should be integrated from the very beginning
- Be able to both lead and be led (UX folks should be involved in planning and decisions but team leads have to make "final" decisions and not everyone can be a part of every decision)
- Bring your team along with you on your process (don't design in a bubble and toss over the wall to devs)
- Always be asking
  - Ask WHY all the time
  - State the problems. Articulate assumptions then validate them
  - Strive to solve the deeper problem
- Always be improving
  - “Only make new mistakes” - Weaver
  - Be open to critique of your own work and processes. Critique makes things better!
  - Contribute to critique of other people's work (help other people improve)
  - If you don't know how to do something, what to do next, how to solve a problem -- Ask! You're awesome, but you're not expected to know everything.
  - Our work is iterative
  - Our teams are iterative
- Look for the story in everything we do (for stakeholders, ourselves, and potential medium posts)

- [Vets.gov Playbook](https://www.vets.gov/playbook/) (but it REALLY needs to be updated)
- [Software and tools list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/design-resources/designtools.md)

### Research & Discovery
- Most designers do their own research or engage deeply in the research process.
- There's no magic formula for doing research but it often (sort of) looks like this:
    - [Discovery Sprint](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/discovery-sprints/how-to-run-discovery-sprint.md) to get the lay of the land and jump start your project.
    - Analytics when there are existing/comparable systems
    - Comparative analysis
    - Baseline testing of any existing/comparable systems
    - card sorting / tree testing
    - Early prototype testing (can be scrappy, paper-based)
    - Prototype testing or testing on staging with code 
    - UAT pre-launch
    - A/B testing with Google Optimizer post launch
    - and for all things, we aim to test with a variety of users -- including those with low-literacy, cognitive disabilities, visual impairments/assistive technology 
- One major obstacle to research is [PRA & things you may not expect](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/what-is-paperwork-reduction-act.md)

#### Secondary research
- VE materials
- Read user voice submissions
- Veteran forums and Facebook groups
- Contact centers
- Secretary's help line group - get access to transcripts/talk over themes
- POTUS letters
- Vet data (https://www.va.gov/vetdata/) for lots of stats on veteran use of VA services, demographics, etc.

### Design
  - Mobile-first
  - Use established design patterns when possible (sort of aligned with the US Web Design Standards)
  - Flow diagrams & maps of existing systems to document "before" AND launch discovery activities
  - Design for accessibility
  - [How to design forms for VA.gov](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/design-resources/form-design-process.md)
  
### Content
- Static content vs. Tool-based content
- UX writing & plain language (when in doubt, ask a Veteran - or five!)
- Consult your friendly content person early and often

### 508/Accessibility
- Design for accessibility
- Test with screenreaders ([see VoiceOver guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/resources/mac-voiceover-guide.md) and [see cross-platform guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/resources/screenreader-testing-cross-platform.md) and ask for a demo if this is new to you)
- Consult your friendly 508 office
- Usability test for accessibility
