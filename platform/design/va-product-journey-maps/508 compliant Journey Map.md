## About This Project

The Journey of Veterans map is a project by the Veterans Experience Office.

The Veterans Experience team traveled across the country to meet and learn more about Veterans from all eras and branches of service. We listened to stories about their diverse military experiences and their evolving civilian lives.

**The purpose of this effort** is to catalyze action through analysis of customer insights, so we can align what we do with the needs and expectations of who we serve.
