# Liquid Template Unit Testing Framework

The Liquid Template Unit Testing Framework was created to replace Cypress for unit testing the logic in `liquid` templates because Cypress is slow, heavy, and is overkill for this purpose. More importantly, this framework provides us with total control over the test data which is critical for testing `liquid` templates, something that Cypress does not provide. For example, a you can test a given `liquid` template against any number of fixtures that represent different entries into the Drupal CMS, so bugs in `liquid` templates can be discovered more quickly.

**Please note**: End-to-end (e2e) tests on VA.gov use Cypress; Cypress has NOT been replaced by this tool.

## How to Use the Framework
To test a `liquid` template, use the `parseFixture()` and `renderHTML()` functions in [`src/site/tests/support/index.js`](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/master/src/site/tests/support/index.js) to create an `HTML` document. Run accessibility checks using the `axeCheck()` function in [`src/site/tests/support/axe.js`](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/master/src/site/tests/support/axe.js).

Be sure to import the functions into your spec file like so:

```js
import { parseFixture, renderHTML } from '~/site/tests/support';
import axeCheck from '~/site/tests/support/axe';

```

### Folder and File Naming Conventions
To create a new test for a template in the `layouts` directory:

1. Create a new folder in the `tests` directory under `layouts` and give the folder the same name as the template under test (but don't include the `.drupal.liquid` extension).
2. Create a new spec file using the following naming convention: 'template name' (without the `.drupal.liquid` extension) + `.unit.spec.js`.
3. Create a `fixtures` folder in the same directory where the `JSON` fixtures can live.

Here's an illustration of this folder structure:

```
/layouts
  /tests
    /example_page
      /fixtures
        example_fixture_1.json
        example_fixture_2.json
      example_page.unit.spec.js
  example_page.drupal.liquid
```

Use the same pattern for templates under test in other directories like `includes`, `navigation`, etc.

### `parseFixture(filePath)`
`parseFixture()` takes a `JSON` fixtures path starting from `src/` and returns a `JavaScript` object.

### `renderHTML(layoutPath, data, dataName)`
`renderHTML()` takes a `liquid` template path starting from `src/`, the `JavaScript` object returned by `parseFixture()`, and an optional `dataName` and renders an `HTML` document. We can then run the usual Mocha assertions on the result. This function uses the same code as our build process, so all of our custom `liquid` filters can be used.

This technique can be used to generate tests of varying complexity, ranging from simple rendering sanity checks to complex logic. Since we control the `JSON` test data, we can easily test different scenarios.

### `axeCheck(container)`
`axeCheck()` takes the `HTML` document returned by `renderHTML()` and returns an array of accessibility violations.

#### Disabled Axe Checks

The following Axe Checks are disabled:

##### `bypass`
The 'bypass' check has been disabled because it may give a false positive for lists of 4-5 links. VA.gov includes a global skip to content link that is evaluated in full page e2e tests.

##### `color-contrast`

The `CSS` file for the static pages found on VA.gov is generated during the build process and, therefore, cannot be referenced by the `HTML` files generated by this tool. The `color-contrast` check has been disabled because it requires the `CSS` file.

##### `document-title`

The `document-title` check has been disabled because `liquid` template `include` files (not entire page templates) can also be tested by this tool and those templates are missing the `title` tag (along with the `html`, `head`, and `body` sections, etc., etc., etc.).

Here's the problem:

If you want to test the `breadcrumbs` `include` file (`src/site/includes/breadcrumbs.drupal.liquid`) the `HTML` used to instantiate a new `JSDOM` object looks like this:

```html
<nav data-template="includes/breadcrumbs" aria-label="Breadcrumb" aria-live="polite" class="va-nav-breadcrumbs"
  <!-- lots of liquid code here -->
</nav>
```

The resulting `html` document looks like this:

```html
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
  <nav data-template="includes/breadcrumbs" aria-label="Breadcrumb" aria-live="polite" class="va-nav-breadcrumbs"
    <!-- lots of liquid code here -->
  </nav>
</body>
</html>
```

Just like a browser, `JSDOM` adds whatever `HTML` is missing to make the document valid.

Notice there's no `title` tag in the `head` of the document. Because of this, we can't perform Axe Checks to make sure a `title` is present, so we need to disable the `document-title` check.

In addition to the reason outlined above, we experienced false-positives on pages that had a valid `title` tag when running the `document-title` check. 

If you want to test the presence of a `title` tag, and that the `title` isn't an empty string, you'll have write unit tests for those 'the old fashion way'.

#### How to Run an Axe Check

Run an accessibility check like this:

```js
it('reports no axe violations', async () => {
  const violations = await axeCheck(container);
  expect(violations.length).to.equal(0);
});
```

Accessibility violations are logged to the console and look like this:

<details>
  <summary>Accessibility Violations</summary>

  ```javascript
  6 Accessibility Violations Were Detected

  Axe Violation 1:
  {
    id: 'aria-roles',
    impact: 'critical',
    tags: [ 'cat.aria', 'wcag2a', 'wcag412' ],
    description: 'Ensures all elements with a role attribute use a valid value',
    help: 'ARIA roles used must conform to valid values',
    helpUrl: 'https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.1/aria-roles?application=axeAPI',
    nodes: [
      {
        any: [],
        all: [],
        none: [Array],
        impact: 'critical',
        html: '<h1 role="nonsense">VA Pittsburgh health care</h1>',
        target: [Array],
        failureSummary: 'Fix all of the following:\n' +
          '  Role must be one of the valid ARIA roles: nonsense'
      }
    ]
  }

  Node 1:
  {
    any: [],
    all: [],
    none: [
      CheckResult {
        id: 'invalidrole',
        data: [Array],
        relatedNodes: [],
        impact: 'critical',
        message: 'Role must be one of the valid ARIA roles: nonsense'
      }
    ],
    impact: 'critical',
    html: '<h1 role="nonsense">VA Pittsburgh health care</h1>',
    target: [ 'h1' ],
    failureSummary: 'Fix all of the following:\n' +
      '  Role must be one of the valid ARIA roles: nonsense'
  }
  ```
</details>

#### `axe-core` Smoke Tests
A smoke test was created to ensure `axe-core` is picking up the expected violiations. This tests acts as a circuit breaker for potential silent failures.

The liquid template for the smoke test is located at `src/site/layouts/liquid_template_axe_check_smoke_test.drupal.liquid`. `axe-core` currently reports 6 violations on this page.

The spec file and fixture is in the `src/site/layouts/tests/liquid_template_axe_check_smoke_test` directory.

### DOM Testing Library

To perform queries using the [DOM Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/), simply import the queries or functions you want to use. Example:
```
import { getByText } from '@testing-library/dom';
```

From the [Dom Testing Library docs](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about): "All of the queries exported by DOM Testing Library accept a container as the first argument."

In the Liquid Template Testing Framework examples found below, the `HTML` document generated is assigned to a variable called `container` in the `spec.js` files. Use this variable as the first argument to the imported DOM Testing Library functions, like this:

```
const node = getByText(container, '3500 Ludington Street');
```

## Rendered `HTML` Is Saved to Disk
For convenience, the `HTML` that's generated from each `liquid` template is automatically saved to `src/site/tests/html` when tests are executed so the `HTML` can be inspected when writing tests. These files are gitignored.

The name of the `HTML` file is created from `liquid` template path.

Example:  
Given the path `src/site/components/phone-number.drupal.liquid`, an `HTML` file called `phone-number.html` will be created.

However, if you're calling `renderHTML()` many times using different `JavaScript` objects returned by `parseFixture()`, you might want to save an `HTML` file for each `JavaScript` object. In that case, pass in a third, optional argument to `renderHTML()` called `dataName` to add `dataName` to the `HTML` filename.

Example:  
Given the path `src/site/components/phone-number.drupal.liquid`, and `labelAndLocationName` for `dataName` an `HTML` file called `phone-number.labelAndLocationName.html` will be created. 

## Sample Test
Here is a sample test:

<details>
 <summary>Sample Liquid Template Unit Test</summary>

```js
const layoutPath = 'src/site/layouts/landing_page.drupal.liquid';

describe('intro', () => {
  describe('no fieldTitleIcon', () => {
    const data = parseFixture(
      'src/site/layouts/tests/landing_page/fixtures/landing_page.json',
    );

    it('renders elements with expected values', async () => {
      const container = await renderHTML(layoutPath, data);
      expect(container.querySelector('h1').innerHTML).to.equal(data.title);
      expect(container.querySelector('.va-introtext p').innerHTML).to.equal(
        data.fieldIntroText,
      );
      expect(
        container.querySelector('i.icon-large.white.hub-icon-foo'),
      ).to.equal(null);
    });
  });
});
```
</details>
