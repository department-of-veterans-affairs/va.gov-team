# Cypress Viewport Updater Bot

The Cypress Viewport Updater Bot updates the following files in `vets-website` each month with recent data from Google Analytics:

- `config/cypress.json`
- `src/platform/testing/e2e/cypress/support/commands/viewportPreset.js`

The updater:

- Requests two Google Analytics reports from the `va.gov` organization:
  - Total number of users in the previous month
  - Total number of users in the previous month using 1) each type of device type (mobile, tablet, and desktop), and 2) screen resolution (viewport width/height), sorted by number of users descending
- Parses the reports and creates viewport objects, categorized by device type
- Grabs the the `cypress.json` and `viewportPreset.js` files from Github
- Updates the files
- Creates a new feature branch
- Commits the updated files
- Submits a pull request

## The Number of Top Viewports

When this feature launched in February, 2021, the updater set viewport data for the **top 5** mobile, tablet and desktop viewports. However, you can set the number of top viewports for each device type by updating the `NUM_TOP_VIEWPORTS` constant in `app/workers/cypress_viewport_updater/viewports.rb` in `vets-api`:

```ruby
NUM_TOP_VIEWPORTS = { mobile: 5, tablet: 5, desktop: 5 }.freeze
```

## `DEVICES` Lookup Table

Each viewport object has a `devicesWithViewport` property that lists the most popular devices for each viewport. These lists are stored in the `DEVICES` lookup table in `app/workers/cypress_viewport_updater/viewport.rb` in `vets-api`.

If a viewport is missing from the lookup table this property will be set to the following string: `This viewport is missing from the devices lookup table. Please contact the Testing Tools Team to have it added.`

Desktop viewports do not use this property; it is set to `This property is not set for desktops.`

## Sidekiq Job

The updater is a Sidekiq job on `vets-api` that runs at 12pm EST on the 3rd of each month.

- Job files: `app/workers/cypress_viewport_updater`
- Job unit tests: `spec/jobs/cypress_viewport_updater`
- Job VCR cassettes: `spec/support/vcr_cassettes/cypress_viewport_updater`
- Scheduled job: `config/sidekiq_scheduler.yml`

The job is scheduled to run on the 3rd day of each month at noon because it apparently takes Google 24-48 hours to fully update Google Analytics data. Official documentation about how often Google updates Google Analytics data could not be found but [this article](#https://www.ecommercetribune.com/marketing/analytics-data/how-often-does-google-analytics-update/) recommends 24-48 hours, which is a common recomendation found on many websites:

> â€¦according to Google, the statistics update every 24 hours for standard accounts. Google also states that it might have a processing latency of 24-48 hours for the accounts which send more than 200.000 sessions per day. This can delay the updates for up to 2 days.
>
> For premium paid Google 360 accounts, the data is updated every 4 hours or less.

## Google Analytics & GitHub Settings

Google API Service Account credentials with read access to va.gov Google Analytics was provided by `#vsp-analytics`.

The `Cypress Viewport Updater Bot` GitHub App is owned by `@department-of-veterans-affairs`.

Secrets for for the Google API Service Account and the GitHub App are stored in credstash. The Google Analytics settings are available in the `google_analytics_cvu` object in `config/settings.yml` and the GitHub settings are available in the `github_cvu` object in `config/settings.yml`. The settings are available in the `dev`, `staging`, `prod`, and `sandbox` environments.

All sensitive Google API and GitHub settings that VCR normally records in each cassette `yml` file have been filtered out.

## Google Analytics VCR Cassettes Were Manually Updated
The following failure was happening in Jenkins:
```
[2021-02-09T22:12:49.377Z] Failures:

[2021-02-09T22:12:49.377Z]      Failure/Error: if (match = interaction.request.body.match(/^grant_type.+/))
[2021-02-09T22:12:49.377Z] 
[2021-02-09T22:12:49.377Z]      ArgumentError:

[2021-02-09T22:12:49.377Z]      # ./spec/jobs/cypress_viewport_updater/google_analytics_reports_spec.rb:20:in `match'
```

The spec `spec/jobs/cypress_viewport_updater/google_analytics_reports_spec.rb` was causing another test to fail, while the spec itself was passing. A most unusual interaction was occurring between spec files.

In `google_analytics_reports_spec.rb` the statement `if (match = interaction.request.body.match(/^grant_type.+/))` replaced a line that started with `grant_type` in the request body with 'removed' in the resulting `spec/support/vcr_cassettes/cypress_viewport_updater/google_analytics_request_report.yml` VCR cassette file. The word 'removed' was encoded in `ASCII-8BIT`:

```
[2] pry(#<Class>)> interaction.request.body
=> "removed"
[3] pry(#<Class>)> interaction.request.body.encoding
=> #<Encoding:ASCII-8BIT>
```

This caused the error `ArgumentError: invalid byte sequence in UTF-8` which is strange because the request body is supposed to be in encoded in `ASCII-8BIT`:

```
    body:
      encoding: ASCII-8BIT
```

Various attempts to fix this error were tried but none were sucessful. It was finally decided to remove the filter and manually update the VCR cassette after it was generated.

If either the `google_analytics_request_report.yml` or the `google_analytics_after_request_report.yml` VCR cassette file ever needs to be regenerated, open the file and manually remove the `jwt` token, the value for `grant_type`:

```
