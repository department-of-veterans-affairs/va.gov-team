# Contract Testing
Contract testing on VA.gov is accomplished using Pact.

Pact is a tool that enables consumer-driven contract testing (CDCT) by defining a contract between service consumers and providers (e.g. `vets-website` applications and `vets-api`). As explained by Pact, “Contract testing is a technique for testing an integration point by checking each application in isolation to ensure the messages it sends or receives conform to a shared understanding that is documented in a 'contract'.“

In this way, Pact enables VFS teams to test integration points with `vets-api` in a non-production environment. This gives VFS teams the ability to ensure that their app is production-ready, and helps VSP ensure that platform-wide changes are non-breaking. Pact allows VFS and VSP to catch issues with integrations before they reach production.

As of 1/7/21, VSP is in the process of rolling out Pact to VFS teams.
