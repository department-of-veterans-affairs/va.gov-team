## Action items

- [ ] @omgitsbillryan @krfz: Look into getting @saneshark an alpha account to Sentry 10
- [x] @f1337: Find a collaborative voting tool for topic suggestions. I think it's a choice between Stickies.io and funretro.io. Funretro appears to have inertia here already, so unless there is vocal disagreement, I suggest we start with that.
