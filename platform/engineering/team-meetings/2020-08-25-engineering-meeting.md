## Demo: Save In-Progress

_presented by @Mottie_

### Problem statement

Filling out forms is a pain, especially for testing.

### What it does

- Allows us to stop & later resume multi-step forms at any step.
- URL slugs turn the feature on and off `#dev-on` and `#dev-off`
- Pre-filled form data is available for all the forms

### Q&A

- Q: is this just for testing? is this veteran-facing?
- A: it's only available on staging & local development

- Q: where does the example data come from?
- A: not sure we clearly answered this question?

- Q: could we start using the #hash-mode to turn on developer mode for other features?
- A: yes

- Q: does this need to be enabled per-form?
- A: it's enabled for all forms that use the forms library


## Demo: Grafana

### Overview

- we're using Grafana for VSP+VFS observability
- recently upgraded, shiny new features, UI improvements, perf improvements

### Q&A

- Q: how do we do annotations?
- A: click on the graph, and add annotation via the UI. there's also an API.

- Q: how do we do alerts?
- A: create a query, then add an alert for it

- Q: could we use this to track usage of the camel case header, ala source-app-name?
