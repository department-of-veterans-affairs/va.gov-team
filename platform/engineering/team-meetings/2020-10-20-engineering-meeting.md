## Loki

_presented by @pnwstevan_

### Overview

Full text logging & structured querying tool from the folks who made Grafana & Prometheus.

Use Cases
- Proactive detection of problems
- Reactive response to problems
- Auditing & compliance (ATO, etc)

Status
- Up and running in dev env today
- Standing up in staging currently
- 

Highlights
- Stevan wrote a Lamba script which scrapes cloudwatch data into Loki via promtail.
- [VFS Confluence documentation](https://vfs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VI/pages/619119010/Loki+-+Centralized+Logging+in+VSP)
- A separate Loki for each environment: production, staging, etc.
- Can create alerts from a Grafana query.

### Q&A

- Does Grafana/Loki provide something similar to ELK's ability to explore anomalies and root causes?
    - Stevan plans to ask at an upcoming conference.

## Forms library decoupling

_presented by @cvalarida_

### Overview

Removing a single import reduced build-time memory usage by .6GB (25%), reduced build size by 50%, and reduced build time 25-40%. Production vets-website build was reduced by ~3.5m

### Q&A

## Action Items

None.
