## Pact Demo

### Overview

The front end defines the specification, which looks a lot like a RSpec converted to JSON:
https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/14212/files#diff-67615f1fcc37263af71accbe505753ac

The back-end hook code (called a "provider state" in Pact parlance) which tells the `pact:verify` spec which endpoints to verify:
https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/pull/4933/files#diff-67b1fb821b639c48ee1dcbcfada48bd6

When the front-end specification is run in CI, it pushes a JSON specification to the Broker:
https://vagov-pact-broker.herokuapp.com/pacts/provider/VA.gov%20API/consumer/Facility%20Locator/latest

The `pact:verify` task in `vets-api` verifies the configured providers against the published Broker specifications, and reports the results to the Broker. This task is run in CI, and can also be run in local development.
