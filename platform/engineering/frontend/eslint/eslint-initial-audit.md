### ESLint Enforced Rules Audit

**Author:** Jhonny Gonzalez

**Last Updated:** February 3, 2020

**eslint version:** 4.18.2

### Objective

The purpose of this audit was to establish the current state of ESLint. It was necessary so I could identify what plugins and rules are already unabled, so we can explore and add new rules in a future.

This audit is a snapshot in time and it should be used as a reference. It's a set base so we could start adding new plugins and rules.

It also allow us to have a reference for dependencies' versions.
