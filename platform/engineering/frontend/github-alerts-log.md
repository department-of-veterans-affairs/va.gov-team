# Goals:

- [x] Identify alerts that are client facing and resolve those first
- [x] Figure out if we need to address the other issues
- [x] Create a triage plan in work tracking tool (JIRA, GitHub Issues, etc.)
- [x] If the vulnerability is acknowledged as will not fix, you can mark that in GitHub vulnerabilities page by clicking dismiss.
- [x] Monitor email alerts for new security vulnerabilities and assign a first responder.
