### Narrative
There's some boilerplate involved with creating new applications, and especially form applications, in vets-website. In order to simplify that process we created a tool that developers can use to quickly generate empty applications and forms.

#### Current Status

The form generator is currently in maintenance mode, pending future discovery around how to make it most useful to developers working on vets-website.

### How to Access / Test

The code is located at https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/generator-vets-website.

It's published as an npm module, which is detailed in that repository's readme.

More extensive documentation on the options is available at https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/platform/tools/generator
