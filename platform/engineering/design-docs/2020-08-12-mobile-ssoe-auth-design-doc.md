## Overview

### Objective
Allow VA Mobile App users, authenticated via the IAM SSOe identity provider, to consume endpoints in api.va.gov

### Background
A flagship mobile app for the VA is being developed to augment services available on va.gov with unique mobile features 
such as notifications and biometric sign-in. The VA’s Identity and Access Management System (IAM) maintains a Single Sign On 
identity provider/service for external apps (SSOe). Web clients can currently establish VA.gov sessions from SAML, Okta, 
and across vites via SSO. To enable the mobile app to consume api.va.gov endpoints we’ll allow mobile SSOe signed requests 
to also create and use VA.gov sessions.

Currently in vets-api all web client session (from va.gov) logic is managed in the `AuthenticationAndSSOConcerns` concern 
that is mixed in to the main `ApplicationController`.  API sessions (from lighthouse) are managed in the `OpenidApplicationController`.

The main difference between the two are that session extension/expiration for web requests are handled in the app while API 
session TTL is part of the token payload.

### High Level Design
When launching the mobile app for the first time a call is made to IAM OAuth service's `../authorise` endpoint. 
This returns a refresh auth token that expires after 30 days. Then, and after all logins during that window, the app makes
a call to IAM's `../token` endpoint to retrieve an access token which signifies that a IAM session has been created.
The mobile app will include that access token in a Bearer authorization header for all requests to vets-api.
When vets-api receives a request with that mobile auth header it will first lookup a session in redis by the access token.
If a session is not found vets-api will use a `IamSsoeService` (draft PR [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/pull/4665)) to call IAM's `../introspect` endpoint which both
validates and returns traits for a user.

The user traits returned by the instrospect endpoint are similar to those returned by ID.me and MVI and can be used to
instantiate a user profile. We will create an adapter class or method to map the fields to a user profile.

Mobile sessions are a hybrid of web sessions and api sessions. Like web sessions they are first class citizens. 
i.e. they do not have restrictions on which endpoints they can call. However they will have their TTL managed 
externally by the IAM auth service.

#### Optional Tech-debt Refactoring

The main `ApplicationController`, which extends `ActionController::API` has a lot of shared error handling 
but also includes methods which only apply to some controllers. It's auth mixin `AuthenticationAndSSOConcerns` 
is specific to va.gov and would not apply to the mobile endpoints and is currently ignored 
(`skip_before_action(:authenticate)`) by some Lighthouse endpoints.

The proposed refactor is to create a concerns for each type of shared logic. This enables two (ruby flavored) refactors;
composition over inheritance and polymorphism over conditionals. Classes only compose in the logic they need
and by doing so don't have to conditionally run, or not run, sections of code.


## Specifics

### Detailed Design
Beyond calling the `IamSsoeAuth::Service` to perform auth token introspection there are two options with varying levels of effort:

- **Option 1** MVP: the minimal solution would have the mobile engine's `ApplicationController` override the session management methods in the core app's `ApplicationController.
- **Option 2** SessionManager: A more complex solution creates a base `SessionManager` to handle all session logic with sub-classes for each auth source; `WebSessionManager`, `MobileSessionManager`, and `ExternalSessionMananger`.

#### Option 1: MVP
The minimum amount of code, with the largest tech debt, overrides the `AuthenticationAndSSOConcerns` session methods, such as `validate_session` in the mobile engine:

```ruby
module MobileAuthenticationConcern
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern
  
  def validate_session
    session_object = Session.find(access_token)
    @current_user = User.find(session_object.uuid) if session_object.present?
    # user exists return true
    return true if @current_user.present?
    
    # user created return true
    @current_user = introspect(access_token)
    @current_user.present?
    
     # if access_token is invalid introspect raises error return false
    rescue Common::Exceptions::Forbidden
      return false
    end
  end
  
  def introspect(access_token)
    response = IamSsoeAuth::Service.new.get_introspect(access_token)
    build_user(response)
  end
end
```

#### Option 2: SessionManager
A more traditional polymorphic approach would replace much of `AuthenticationAndSSOConcerns` with a base `SessionManager` that has 
`WebSessionMananger` and `MobileSessionMananger` sub-classes. It would declare an interface for session
manangement by defining a set of methods that must be overrriden by its sub-classes.

Web (va.gov) controllers would instantiate a `WebSessionManager` and Mobile controllers would instantiate a `MobileSessionMananger`. 
As both managers implement the same interface we won’t need to sprinkle web or mobile conditional logic throughout the concern. The request determines 
which state it’s in and chooses the appropriate manager:

<img src="images/mobile-ssoe-auth/mobile_ssoe_auth_class.png" alt="mobile auth sequence diagram" width="700"/>

Should another form of session manager be needed in the future it can implement the same interface. The design also makes testing easier as the logic to determine if each type of session manager is correct can be tested in isolation.

#### Optional Tech-debt Refactoring
The main `ApplicationController` includes shared error handling and logging that all its child controllers use. 
However, it also has quite a few methods which only apply to some controllers. This code could move to dedicated concerns 
and specific controllers could compose in only the logic they need.

### Code Location
Code will live in the [vets-api](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api) repo. IAM auth code will be located in lib/iam_ssoe_auth as in the [draft PR](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/pull/4665).

### Testing Plan
- As with MVI, IAM's OAuth team requires a live demo to move up environments
- Updated and new specs for session creation
- Integration tests first on a review instance then staging (may require the rollback dance if staging testing requires more than a day)

### Logging
- New log lines and metrics around the type of session created.
- Log errors when session creation fails or are unexpectedly not found.
- Log auth attempts that do not originate from the mobile app.

### Debugging
- TODO: Link to review instance/staging rails console instructions
- TODO: Link to mobile build instructions, logging details
- TODO: Check on access to IAM logs, add IAM point of contact

### Caveats
TBD

### Security Concerns
Access Token seems shorter than most in the wild e.g. Amazon's is 350 chars long. Session highjacking through brute force would be harder if it was longer. Session hijacking and replay attacks could be mitigated by [binding the access token to the TLS connection](https://medium.facilelogin.com/oauth-2-0-token-binding-e84cbb2e60).

While it extends beyond API security some anti-tampering services can detect if requests are coming from an app that has been modified.

### Privacy Concerns
The API will deliver the same PII to the mobile app that it does to va.gov. New logging should be tied to anonymous user session identifier rather than PII. Some security measures employed by private sector apps infringe on privacy. Measures such as validating requests through device fingerprinting would violate the VA's PII policies. 

While it's up to the end user to protect their phone, should a phone be stolen/compromised an option to disable long-term refresh tokens from va.gov (or by the call-center) would protect the affected veteran's data.

### Open Questions and Risks
- Does IAM SSOe OAuth support TLS token binding?
- Do VSP/VFS developers have access to IAM logs?

### Work Estimates
TBD

### Alternatives
- Okta: Okta and the lighthouse API paths were considered for auth. Okta's cost/user, SSOe's momentum at VA, and the greater number of endpoints that would have to be rebuilt worked against Okta as an auth choice.

### Future Work
The work outlined in this PR would complete the mobile auth flow.
