## Overview

### Objective
Create a simple, flexible forms library which can be used either in whole or in
part by application teams building any kind of form on VA.gov.

The intended audience of this document is
- Front end engineers building the library
- Application teams who may use it to build forms on VA.gov

### Background
We currently have a library which application teams use to build form
applications on VA.gov. It employs a configuration-based approach to rapidly
build forms in a consistent way.

To distinguish the new forms library from the old in this document, this new
forms library will be called **Formulate**.

#### Problems

##### Library bloat
The current forms library uses a single form configuration object to create the
entire form application. Modifying this `formConfig` object is the only way to
change anything in the form. When new features for individual forms are needed,
a change to the underlying library is required. This creates significant bloat
in the library and makes it difficult to modify.

##### Tightly-coupled systems
Often, an application team will want to tweak an aspect of a form, but the only
way to do that is by modifying the underlying library. The system-level autonomy
in individual forms is very limited.

See also [Library bloat](#library-bloat) above.

##### Steep learning curve
The book _Good Services_ sets forth a couple of relevant service design
principles:
- Work in a way that is familiar
- Require no prior knowledge to use

The form configuration approach is not one that is familiar to front end
engineers to create applications and requires _much_ prior knowledge to use
effectively. When learning the basics of the library, its complexity is
relatively minimal, but quickly grows as the form becomes more complex. This is
largely due to the library bloat outlined above.

##### And more!
There are many other problems with the current forms library that could be
written about at length, but to save space, we can group the bullet points into
a few categories. The following lists are by no means comprehensive.

**Assumptions made by the library**
- The whole application is a form
- The form is broken into chapters and pages
- Must have an introduction page
  - The first path in the form must be the introduction page
- Must have a review page
- Must have sequential pages determined ahead of time
  - VAOS, for example, makes external calls to determine what the next page
    the user needs to see is
- Must have a schema

**Building a form from a single configuration**
- Code splitting becomes problematic because everything is centralized
- It's a very [complicated interface](#steep-learning-curve)

**Building a form from a schema**
- The schema to build the form fields must sometimes differ from the validation
  schema, which means data transformation functions are required
  - The 21-526EZ form is a prime example of this because of its complexity
- Again, the [learning curve](#steep-learning-curve) gets in the way of rapid
  progress on more complicated forms
  - Engineers have to learn the interface for making dynamic changes through
    hooks provided in the `uiSchema` instead of using standard React conventions
- Using external services to determine which fields to render is cumbersome
  - Rather than conditionally rendering the fields, engineers must generate a
    schema
- Paring `schema` and `uiSchema` makes sharing reusable patterns awkward
  - Implementation details such as the data paths are baked into the
    definitions of these reusable patterns

### High Level Design
Formulate will be a modular library consisting of helper functions and
components to aid in the rapid development of forms on VA.gov. These functions
and components can be conceptualized as **sub-modules** for:
- [Building form pages](#form-page-builder)
  - Wrappers for Formik components using the design system
  - Re-exporting necessary Formik components
- [Routing](#routing)
  - Simple set-up for using Formik across multiple pages
  - Components for rendering the standard form "chrome"
  - Looping through a series of pages per item in an array
  - Conditionally-rendered pages
- [Save in progress](#save-in-progress)
  - Manual save
  - Auto save
  - Data migrations

**Each sub-module will be independent.** If a form doesn't need the multi-page
routing, the team building it simply won't use the routing sub-module, and it
won't be included in their application bundle. Likewise, if a form needs more
complex routing, the team building it can opt to roll their own, but still reap
the benefits of using the rest of the system.

_Note: "sub-modules" here refer to independent parts of a larger system and have
nothing to do with [Git
Sub-Modules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Sub-Modules)._

Additionally, the library will provide a number of helper functions and
components for:
- Field-level schema validation
- [Building a review page](#json-schema-validation)

## Specifics

### Detailed Design
**Key technologies** we'll use:
- React
- TypeScript
- [`api-extractor`](https://api-extractor.com/pages/overview/intro/)
- [React router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [Formik](https://formik.org/)

The following sections outline the various parts of the system.

#### Form page builder
Formulate will leverage Formik for much of the form page building. It will
**re-export Formik components** where it makes sense and **provide light
wrappers for Formik input fields** using design system components.

In addition to simple wrappers, Formulate will use Formik to provide more
complex fields such as file upload which may be imported and used in
applications.

##### Why not just use Formik directly?
It should be possible to use Formik directly without any issues. The form page
builder sub-module intends to make using the design system with Formik simpler.

##### Validation
One of the benefits the current forms library provides is field validation.
Error messages appear only on fields that have been touched or on all fields
after page navigation is attempted.

Formulate will use the baked-in validation handling from Formik. See [When Does
Validation
Run](https://formik.org/docs/guides/validation#when-does-validation-run) and
[Form Submission:
Validation](https://formik.org/docs/guides/form-submission#validation) for more
details on how Formik handles validation. For an example of when validation
runs, you can find examples using `ErrorMessage` on codesandbox.io such as [this
one](https://codesandbox.io/s/olql6q2m1q).

In addition to displaying error messages on touched fields, when form submission
occurs (including during page navigation), Formulate will focus on the first
field with an error message.

#### Routing
This sub-module will be responsible for the user navigating through a multi-page
form. In particular, it will:
- Present the form broken down into chapters and pages
- Manage routes for each page
- Render each page wrapped in the chrome appropriate for navigation
  - Form title, page title, progress bar, back / continue buttons, etc.
- Prevent progress through the form if there are validation errors on the
  current page
- Manage the form data
  - Each individual page is essentially its own mini-form; the router stitches
    all the data together into a single cohesive experience

To accomplish this, there will be four primary pieces in the routing
sub-module:
- [`Router` component](#router-component)
  - Holds form state and manages routes
- [`Chapter` component](#chapter-component)
  - Optional component to render some additional chrome and prefix page paths
- [`Page` component](#page-component)
  - Renders the page contents with the back and continue buttons
- [`Route` component](#route-component)
  - Adds a route outside of the sequential form flow

Additionally, to accommodate some common patterns on VA.gov form applications,
Formulate will provide:
- [Helpers for building array pages](#functionality-array-pages)
- [Helpers for building the review page](#review-page)

##### `Router` Component
**Purpose:**
The `Router` is at the heart of the routing sub-module. It will hold the routes
and components to render at each route.

**Usage requirements:**
_None_

**Responsibilities:**
- Provide a [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) with the
  form state
  - When the user navigates to a new page, the page state will be deeply
    merged with the form state in the React Context
  - `Page` will use the form data from the form state as the page's
    [`initialValues`](https://formik.org/docs/api/formik#initialvalues-values)
    - This is because each page is a separate Formik form, so the `Router` is
      responsible for stitching all these individual forms together into one
      cohesive experience
- Build a list of routes for the form flow from `Chapter` and `Page`
  components' `path` props
  - **Important:** `Route`s define valid routes in a form, but those pages
    live "outside" the normal form flow; these are used for pages such as
    `/form-saved` and `/error`
  - `Page`s nested in `Chapter`s will have their paths prefixed with the
    `Chapter` path
  - For example:
    ```jsx
    <Chapter path="/personal-information">
      <Page path="/name">...</Page>
    </Chapter>
    ```
    This will result in a path definition of `/personal-information/name`
- Re-compute the list of routes before each page navigation (below)
  - This ensures any data changes that might affect the routes are captured
- Provide callbacks in the React Context to navigate forward and backward
  through the list of computed routes
  - The functions for navigating forward and backward will merge page state
    into the form state in the React Context
  - The function to navigate forward will prevent navigation if there are
    validation errors

##### `Chapter` Component
**Purpose:**
The **optional** `Chapter` component will be used to render the VA.gov "chrome"
for multi-page forms which have multiple chapters. This "chrome" includes the
form title, current chapter name, and progress bar.

**Usage requirements:**
- `Chapter` may only be a child of `Router`
- Its only children may be `Page`s
- A `Chapter` must have children

**Responsibilities:**
- Render the chapter title and progress bar
- Render the child `Page`s

##### `Page` Component
**Purpose:**
A `Page` is used to define the path for a page and render its form contents and
the normal page chrome.

**Usage requirements:**
A `Page` may be the child of either `Router` directly or `Chapter`.

**Responsibilities:**
- If no `overrideFormik` prop is passed
  - Render a [`<Formik>`](https://formik.org/docs/api/formik) component and pass
    it some default props for `initialValues`, `validate`, and `onSubmit`
  - If the save-in-progress React Context is available, `Page` will use it to
    auto-save the form
- Render the children, passing them the extra props for form state
  - Extra props include `formData` and `pathParams`
  - For an example usage, see [below](#functionality-array-pages)
- Render the form navigation buttons "Back" and "Continue"
- Prevent navigation if there are validation errors

**A note on cloning children**
To pass the form state to `Page`'s children, it will clone all its children and
pass the form state props along with the child's given props. Implementation
will look something like the following:
```js
const newChildren = React.Children.map(
  this.props.children,
  child => React.cloneElement(child, { formData, pathParams }));
```

This means developers can create form pages in a couple different ways. 

_Using the form state:_
```jsx
<Page>
  {({ formData, pathParams }) => (/* Use the form state to render the correct fields */)}
</Page
```

_Not using the form state:_
```jsx
<Page>
  <StringField name="foo" />
  <StringField name="bar" />
</Page
```

In the above example, both `StringField`s will have the following props:
- `name`
- `formData`
- `pathParams`

The form state props `formData` and `pathParams` will simply go unused.

##### `Route` Component
**Purpose:**
The `Route` will be re-exported from `react-router-dom`. The purpose of
re-exporting is twofold:
- Simplifies imports
- Ensures only one version of `react-router-dom` is used

**Usage requirements:**
- `Route` may only be a child of `Router`

**Why not just use `Page`?**
The `Chapter` and `Page` components are meant to be used to define pages where
the user may enter data. These pages are sequential and have back and continue
buttons. `Route`s are used for pages in the application that live outside that
form flow. These pages may include:
- `/introduction`
- `/form-saved`
- `/error`

##### Functionality: Array pages
Array pages are one or more pages that are looped through in a form flow, once
per item in the array. To help understand the nuances of array pages, consider
the following example:

```jsx
<Page
  path="/marriages/:marriageIndex/foo"
  pathParams={{
    marriageIndex: 'marriages'
  }}>
  {({ formData, pathParams }) => (
    <Field name={`marriages.${pathParams.marriageIndex}.name.first`} />
  )}
</Page>
```

For array pages to work we need a couple core things:
- The path for the page
- The data for the current item in the array

To get these pieces, `Page` will accept the `path` and `pathParams` props.

`path` will be the URL within the application and must (for array pages) contain
path parameters. A path parameter must be the only token in the URL segment
(between `/`s or at the end of the URL). For example, `/:index/foo` and
`/:index` are valid path parameters. `/my-:index-item` is an invalid path
parameter. The name of the path parameter may be anything, but it must start
with a `:`.

`pathParams` will be an object whose keys map to the path parameters and whose
values map to the path to the form data. In the above example, the `pathParams`
will assign `:marriageIndex` in the URL a number based in the current item in
the `marriages` array.

##### Review page
To keep Formulate simple, it will not build the review page automatically. It
will be the responsibility of the engineers to build the review page. This
decision is subject to change, but as of the time of this writing, I can't think
of a way to automatically build the review page and meet all of the following
requirements:
- The chapters are divided correctly
- The pages are divided correctly
- The edit mode for each page is identical to the page in the form flow
- The review mode for each page displays each field on the page in a data table
  with the appropriate label and value
- Each field in the review mode may be overridden when the label or value need
  to be changed for a better user experience
- Each page may or may not have a review mode

Instead, Formulate will supply components to aid engineers in rapidly building
review pages. These components will include:

- `FormReview`
- `ChapterReview`
- `PageReview`
- `FieldReview`

**TODO:** Figure out how submission validation plays in here. How do we run all
validation on all pages?

#### Save-in-progress
Pieces of the save-in-progress sub-module are:
- [`SaveInProgress` component](#component-saveinprogress)
  - Adds `SiPIndicator` to each page
  - Provides functions to save and load the form
- [`SiPIndicator` component](#component-sipindicator)
  - Allows users to manually save the form
  - Shows the form save state (saved, saving, error, etc.)
- [Re-usable `FormSaved` component](#component-formsaved)
  - To be used in a `<Route path="/form-saved">`
- [Data migration functionality](#data-migrations)

##### Component: `SaveInProgress`
**Purpose:** This is the primary component for enabling the save in progress
functionality for a form.

**Usage requirements:**
This component must wrap the `Router` or `Formik` components so we can pass a
`saveForm` prop to it to be hooked into `Formik`'s `handleChange` callback.

**Responsibilities:**
- Add the `SiPIndicator` to the bottom of each form page
- Accept a list of paths to not display `SiPIndicator`
- Provide a React Context with the following
  - `saveForm` function
    - Save the form when `saveForm` is called
  - `loadForm` function
    - Call the supplied endpoint with the supplied arguments
    - Set the form data to the form data in the result
    - Perform any data migrations applicable
    - Navigate to the page supplied by the result
- Accept a [`dataMigrations`](#data-migrations) prop to be used with `loadForm`
- Accept a `postLoad` function which will be run after data migration and before
  re-routing to the return URL in the saved form metadata
  - This may be used to call an external service (e.g. to fetch the latest rated
    disabilities) and modify either the form data or metadata as needed (e.g. to
    reroute to the rated disabilities selection page, if the SiP disabilities
    don't match the data most recently fetched from the upstream service)

##### Component: `SiPIndicator`
**TODO:** Rename this thing. Ideas?

**Purpose:** To indicate when the form has been auto-saved and to provide a link
to save and exit the form.

**Usage requirements:**
This must appear as a descendant of `SaveInProgress` since it uses the React
Context provided by that component to save the form.

**Responsibilities:**
- Display a link to save and exit the form
- Display the form save state
  - Saved, loading, error, etc.
- Display the saved form ID if available (returned from the API request)
- Call an API endpoint to save the form data
- Navigate to `/form-saved`

**Location on the page:** This component will appear at the bottom of every page
except for those it is configured not to. The default routes which it will not
appear will be:
- `/introduction`
- `/review-and-submit`
- `/confirmation`
- `/form-saved`

**A note on usage:** The primary usage of this component is internal to
Formulate, used by `SaveInProgress`, but it may be used separately if desired.

##### Component: `FormSaved`
**Purpose:** To make the common `/form-saved` route easy to add to an
application.

**Usage requirements:**
_None_

**Responsibilities:**
- Render some text
- Render a link to continue the form

##### Data migrations
When a form in production needs to be changed in a way that will affect the
user's ability to complete the form accurately, a data migration may be written
to account for it. Examples include:
- The validation for a field changes
- An existing field was previously not required but now is
- A new required field is added
- A new page is added
- A field is removed

The goal of migrations is to bring the saved data of an old version of the form
up to match the new version of the form.

A `dataMigrations` prop may be passed to the `SaveInProgress` component.
`dataMigrations` must be an array of functions. Each function will be called
with the form data and metadata, either from the API request or a previous
migration function. Metadata will include:
- Form version when the data was saved
- The page URL when the form was saved

Each function must return the new form data and metadata. If multiple migration
functions must be run, the result of an earlier migration will be passed to the
next migration in the array.

Migrations are run during the `loadForm` function. It will check the form
version in the metadata against the length of the `dataMigrations` array. If the
latter is greater, all migrations after the saved form version will be called in
order.
    
#### JSON schema validation
To ensure the data sent from the front end matches data expected on the back
end, the client and API must share a common schema. Forms on VA.gov have used
the [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org) specification for this.

While Formik has [built-in support for
`Yup`](https://formik.org/docs/guides/validation#validationschema) schemas,
these are JavaScript-only and not easily shareable with the API. As such, we
will continue to support JSON schema by writing a function which can be used
while creating the [validate
function](https://formik.org/docs/guides/validation#validate) for each page or
field.

The JSON schema validation function will accept a JSON schema and return a
closure which can be used to validate individual fields against the schema. This
closure will also have chainable functions which may be used to override the default
error messages.

Formulate will use the [`jsonschema`](https://github.com/tdegrunt/jsonschema)
package to perform the JSON schema validation due to its
[popularity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonschema), [small
size](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=jsonschema@1.4.0), and [parseable
result](https://github.com/tdegrunt/jsonschema#results).

Each [JSON schema validation
keyword](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation.html#rfc.section.6)
will have a default error message and a corresponding function to override that
default. This function will accept either a string, React component, or a
function that's passed the value of the field as a parameter. The function must
return either a string or React component. (See below for an example.)

##### Usage
**Setup:**
```js
// schema-validation.js
import loadSchema from 'formulate/schema-validation';
import jsonSchema from '@department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-json-schema/my-form-schema.json';

const fromSchema = loadSchema(jsonSchema);

export fromSchema;
```

**Single validate function for the page:**
```js
import fromSchema from '../schema-validation';

const validate = values => {
  const errors = {};
  
  const passwordErrorMessage = fromSchema('password') // Path to schema
    .minLength("This, uh, isn't very safe...") // Optional error message overrides
    .pattern('Please follow the pattern, will you?') // Chained message override functions
    (values.password); // Data entered in the form
  if (passwordErrorMessage) errors.password = passwordErrorMessage;
}
```

**[Validate a single field:](https://formik.org/docs/guides/validation#field-level-validation)**
```jsx
import fromSchema from '../schema-validation';
import { StringField } from 'formulate';

const ThisPage = () => (
  <>
    <StringField
      name="name.first"
      validate={fromSchema('name.first').pattern("Please enter your _real_ name.")} />
    <StringField
      name="name.last"
      validate={fromSchema('name.last')} />
  </>
)
```

Notice how in the first example, the function must be called with the value
after all optional error message override functions, but in the second example,
Formik calls the function with the value for the field itself.

**Use the field value in the message:**
```js
const validateField = fromSchema('path')
  .maxLength(value => `You entered ${value.length} characters, which is too many.`);
```

##### Caveat
This field-level validation doesn't ensure that the form data submitted to the
API matches the same shape as the JSON schema defines. Because a mismatch in the
shape of the form data and corresponding schema has nothing to do with what the
user entered, this is a developer mistake and should be caught by developers and
not user-facing validation errors.

To clarify, take the following example:
**Schema**
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "email": { "type": "string" },
    "email-confirmation": { "type": "string" },
  }
}
```

**Data**
```js
{
  email: {
    original: "foo@bar.com",
    confirmation: "foo@bar.com"
  }
}
```
Formulate will not deliberately catch mistakes like this, but it should be
reasonably difficult to make these mistakes when using the `fromSchema`
validation since the field's `name` property should likely match the schema path
used in validation.

Implementing such a mistake would look something like this using the
`fromSchema` validation:
```jsx
<StringField
  name="email-confirmation"
  validation={fromSchema('email.confirmation')} />
```

A simple solution is to use a variable for both name and validation:
```jsx
const emailConfPath = 'email-confirmation';
<StringField
  name={emailConfPath}
  validation={fromSchema(emailConfPath)} />
```

**Discussion:** Is not ensuring the shape of the data matches the schema a
reasonable boundary for the library to stop at?

**Discussion:** What tools might Formulate give to developers to help catch
these kinds of data shape mismatch mistakes?

### Code Location
Formulate will live in its own repository.

### Documentation
Formulate documentation will follow the [diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/).

The following documentation is considered essential for the successful adoption
of Formulate.
- [Tutorials](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/)
  - Getting started
  - Building a multi-page form
- [How-to guides](https://diataxis.fr/how-to-guides/)
  - How to build a review page
  - How to make array pages
  - How to make single-page list loops
  - How to build a custom field
  - How to write a data migration
- [Reference documentation](https://diataxis.fr/reference/) tooling
  - See [Reference documentation](#reference-documentation) below
- [Explanations](https://diataxis.fr/explanation/)
  - Why keep form state in a React Context for multi-page forms?

All documentation will be located within the Formulate repo in the `docs/`
directory. It is essential that documentation and code live side-by-side so the
documentation may be updated at the same time as the code. Additionally, keeping
all the documentation in `docs/` allows us to serve it simply using GitHub Pages.

Tutorials will serve as the entry point for learning how to use Formulate.
Because the level of effort maintaining tutorials is high, they will be
intentionally few. Tutorials may be found in `docs/tutorials/`.

#### How-to guides
These guides will cover how to perform common tasks using Formulate. They will
live in the `docs/how-to-guides/` directory of the repo.

#### Reference documentation
Automated API documentation will be generated by
[`api-extractor`](https://api-extractor.com) in conjunction with
`api-documenter` to create markdown files which will then be hosted on GitHub
Pages, and linked to from both the [Documentation Front
Page](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va.gov-team/) and the
[Documentation
Site](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/).

**Example:** Microsoft's own Rushstack—which is the monorepo where
[`api-extractor`](https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack/tree/master/apps/api-extractor)
is developed—uses Jekyll to create HTML pages from the markdown files generated
by
[`api-documenter`](https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack/tree/master/apps/api-documenter).
See the
[`rushstack.io-website`](https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack.io-website) repo
and [corresponding website](https://rushstack.io/pages/api/).

The built reference documentation will live in `docs/reference/`.

#### Explanations
Architecture decisions and other explanations for decisions made for the
library will live in `docs/explanations/`.

### Testing Plan
Automated unit and integration tests will be written to ensure the components
and functions in Formulate work independently and together. Any changes to the
API of these components and functions will break the tests.

### Logging
N/A

### Debugging

#### Development logs
Formulate will try to catch developer mistakes by emitting console logs in
development builds similar to React. Mistakes it will attempt to catch include:
- `FieldReview` components with no associated form data
  - This is probably because the name (path to the data) is incorrect
- Missing or invalid props

#### Debugger object
In development mode, the `Router` will attach a `Formulate` object to `window`.
From the browser console, engineers will be able to call functions on
`window.Formulate` to:
- See all the form data
- Set data for individual fields
- Override the entire form data
- See the list of routes

### Caveats
<!--
Gotchas, differences between the design and implementation, other potential
stumbling blocks for users or maintainers, and their implications and
workarounds. Unless something is known to be tricky ahead of time, this section
will probably start out empty.

Rather than deleting it, it's recommended that you keep this section with a
simple place holder, since caveats will almost certainly appear down the road.

_To be determined._

### Security Concerns
N/A

### Privacy Concerns
N/A

### Open Questions and Risks
- Not using the same JSON schema to create the form fields as used in the data
  validation opens the possibility that submitted data will fail validation
  - For example, say the first name field doesn't have any validation in the
    JSX, but the JSON schema contract with the API specifies a `maxLength`
    of 25. A user can enter a name that's 27 characters long and not trigger any
    validation errors until the submission step.
  - This is a potential regression in UX
  - To counteract this, the forms library will accept an optional JSON schema
    and validate each form field against it.
- Not using any kind of schema to create fields may lead to a field overwriting
  bug
  - If I give on input field the data path of `password` and another of
    `password.confirm`, for example
  - **Possible solution:** The answer here may be to somehow check all the
    inputs against the form schema to ensure they're a match.

### Work Estimates

#### Milestone: Scaffold the project
First, we have to prepare the library for development.

**Prerequisites:** _None_

**Tasks:**
- Create the repo
- Enable branch protection and code owners
- Set up the TypeScript build process
- Set up the testing tools
- Set up `eslint` and `prettier`
- Set up linting pre-commit hook

**Estimate:** 1 day

#### Milestone: Create the form builder fields
This milestone is centered around getting the fields to look and feel like
VA.gov fields.

**Prerequisites:**
- Scaffold the project

**Tasks:**
- Re-export Formik components such as `Formik` and `Form`
- Build input fields
  - Text box
  - Text area
  - Checkbox
  - Radio group
  - Select box
  - File input
  
**Estimate:** < 1 week

#### Milestone: Routing with chapters and pages
Here, we build `Router`, `Chapter`, and `Page`. By the end, it should be
possible to navigate between pages.

**Prerequisites:**
- Scaffold the project

**Tasks:**
- Build the `Router` with bare-bones `Chapter`, and `Page` components
- Use the `Chapter` and `Page` in `Router` to construct routes for the
  application
- Handle navigation forward and backward through the form

**Estimate:** < 1 week

#### Milestone: Pass data through the form
Once we have multiple pages in a form, we need to keep data that the user
entered on a previous form and allow future pages to access it.

**Prerequisites:**
- Routing with chapters and pages

**Tasks:**
- Create the React Context to hold form state
- Provide the Context in `Router`

**Estimate:** < 1 day

#### Milestone: Add visual chrome
Forms on VA.gov have a certain look and feel. This is where we add the title,
progress bar, and other visual elements to `Chapter` and `Page`

**Prerequisites:**
- Pass data through the form

**Tasks:**
- Add the total number of chapters to the form state React Context
- Add the form title to the form state React Context
- Display the title on every page
- Display the segmented progress bar on each page

**Estimate:** 2 days

#### Milestone: Build review page components
We can make building the review page less painful by building some good default
components and being mindful of the developer experience.

**Prerequisites:** None, but it might be easier to test after the form state is
supplied in a React Context.

**Tasks:**
- Build the field review component
  - Will make an intelligent guess on what the output should be based on the
    data type
- Build the page review component
  - Will accept field names and render field review components for each
  - Will accept field review component overrides
- Build the chapter review component
  - Will accept a list of pages, each with an edit and review component

**Estimate:** 1 - 2 weeks

#### Milestone: Write the save in progress functions
This milestone is to build the functions for saving and loading the form.

**Prerequisites:**
- Scaffold the project

**Tasks:**
- Write the `saveForm` function
- Write the `loadForm` function
  - Include the data migration functionality

**Estimate:** 1 - 2 weeks

#### Milestone: Write the save in progress components
**Prerequisites:**
- Write the save in progress functions

**Tasks:**
- Write the following components
  - `SaveInProgress`
  - `SiPIndicator`
  - `FormSaved`
  
**Estimate:** 2 weeks

#### Milestone: Tutorials
Tutorials are an essential part for successful adoption of the library. The
smoother we can make the first few steps, the better.

**Prerequisites:**
- Create the form builder fields
- Routing with chapters and pages
- Pass data through the form

**Tasks:**
- Write the `Getting Started` tutorial
  - This covers the basics of spinning up a form with no routing
  - We should leverage the Formik documentation heavily here and mention the
    things we do differently, like grouping the field labels with the field
- Write the `Building a multi-page form` tutorial
  - Covers routing
  - Points to the how-to guides at the end

**Estimate:** 2 weeks

#### Milestone: How-to guides
The real meat of the documentation consist of these guides that focus on
accomplishing discreet tasks.

**Prerequisites:**
- Create the form builder fields
- Routing with chapters and pages
- Pass data through the form

**Tasks:**
- Write the following guides
  - How to build a review page
  - How to make array pages
  - How to make single-page list loops
  - How to build a custom field
  - How to write a data migration

**Estimate:** 3 - 4 weeks

#### Milestone: API reference
This API reference documentation will be generated automatically. The goal is to
provide a detailed description of how to use each component and function in the
library, both internal and external.

**Prerequisites:**
- Scaffold the project

**Tasks:**
- Initialize and customize the `api-documenter` configuration
- Generate the API documentation in a GitHub action
- Commit the modified documentation in a GitHub action on the `main` branch
  using [`git-auto-commit-action`](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action)

**Estimate:** 1 week

#### Milestone: Explanations
This section will hold explanations for decisions made for the library. They may
be simple decision records or in-depth technical explanations.

**Prerequisites:** _None_

**Tasks:**
- Write the explanation for why the routing module stores form state in a React
  Context

**Estimate:** 2 days

### Alternatives
_This section contains alternative solutions to the stated objective, as well as
explanations for why they weren't used. In the planning stage, this section is
useful for understanding the value added by the proposed solution and why
particular solutions were discarded. Once the system has been implemented, this
section will inform readers of alternative solutions so they can find the best
system to address their needs._

### Future Work

- "Array pages" on objects, where the URL contains object property names
- Lazy loading data migration functions
