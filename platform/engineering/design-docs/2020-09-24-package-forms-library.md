## Overview

### Objective

The goal of this project is to define clear boundaries around the collection of code, markup, and styling that is referred to as "the forms library."

Some non-goals are:

- Bug fixes to the forms library
- Adding new features to the forms library
- Refactoring the forms library beyond what is required to group the existing code together in the same package
- Publishing the forms library (yet)

The intended audience for this document is VSP and VFS frontend engineers.

### Background

The forms library is a collection of React components, CSS, and JS that allows an app team to build a form application for `vets-website` using a form configuration.

Right now in `vets-website` we have the following folders containing code for the forms library:

- `src/platform/forms`
- `src/platform/forms-system`

We also have forms-adjacent code in the form of other dependencies

- `@department-of-veterans-affairs/react-jsonschema-form` (See [Tighter dependencies](#tighter-dependencies))
- `vets-json-schema`


Additionally, the forms library code is entangled with other platform code as well as some app code.

#### Application entanglement

We have several examples of the forms library importing application code, which is the opposite of what should happen.
The forms library is meant to be a library that is used _by_ applications. Having certain parts of applications import forms library code while the forms library also imports application code leads to multiple problems and blurs the lines of responsibility.

[This definition file](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/720a867817f5b83bd1d713bd51202863b41739b1/src/platform/forms/definitions/nonMilitaryJobs.js#L1) in the forms library imports some app code, yet the file itself is _only_ used in other app code.

There is a [helper file](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/cc4a3172edc242bf60c93aec5b170c734dc57985/src/applications/personalization/dashboard/helpers.jsx) in `src/applications/personalization` which exports a number of consts which are used in the following file within the forms library:

- [`ApplicationStatus.jsx`](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/cc4a3172edc242bf60c93aec5b170c734dc57985/src/platform/forms/save-in-progress/ApplicationStatus.jsx#L6-L10)

(The `vets-website` [PR #14468](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/14468) made some progress here, but `ApplicationStatus` presented some additional complexities.)

Finally, there are some testing helpers that live in the `src/applications/hca` directory and are used in forms library tests:

- [`01-sip-autosave.e2e.spec.js`](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/cc4a3172edc242bf60c93aec5b170c734dc57985/src/platform/forms/tests/save-in-progress/01-sip-autosave.e2e.spec.js#L4)
- [`01-sip-fail-load.e2e.spec.js`](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/cc4a3172edc242bf60c93aec5b170c734dc57985/src/platform/forms/tests/save-in-progress/01-sip-load-fail.e2e.spec.js#L3)
- [`01-sip-finish-later.e2e.spec.js`](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/cc4a3172edc242bf60c93aec5b170c734dc57985/src/platform/forms/tests/save-in-progress/01-sip-finish-later.e2e.spec.js#L4)
- [`01-sip-review.e2e.spec.js`](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/cc4a3172edc242bf60c93aec5b170c734dc57985/src/platform/forms/tests/save-in-progress/01-sip-review.e2e.spec.js#L3)


#### Platform entanglement

In addition to the forms library, the platform provides other code that is used both in the forms library and in applications. 

- `utilities`
- `monitoring`
- `site-wide`
- `user`
- `static-data`

These aren't _strictly_ part of the forms library, but since the forms library makes use of its parent platform code, it becomes more difficult to place clear boundaries around the forms library.
In a properly structured package, any dependencies are called out in the `package.json`, rather than imported from outside of the package's root directory.

### High Level Design

The forms library will be consolidated into a single place and bundled as a Node package.
This will allow VFS teams to import it as if it were any other Node module.

This change should introduce minimal functional impact on individual application teams.
The only application code changes will be updating where the forms library code and styles are imported from.

## Specifics

### Detailed Design

The VSP Design System team will make several changes that will result in a packaged forms library.

Before we can begin to treat the forms library as a package, we will need to resolve the [application entanglement](#application-entanglement).
`ApplicationStatus` will need to be refactored to use the `save-in-progress-messages` helpers rather than application code.
Additionally, the `static-pages` contexts that `ApplicationStatus` is used in will need to be updated to lazy load & pass in the `formConfig` that those helpers will use. `createEducationApplicationStatus` will require a bit more work since it has the potential to be using one of many `formConfig`s. The best approach is likely to turn `ApplicationStatus` into a functional component so that an async/await function can be used to select the appropriate `formConfig`.

Next, there will be some prep work to make it easier to bundle all of the forms library code into a single location. After this, the code can be consolidated into a single directory: `src/platform/packages/forms-library`. This is where the package will live.
This will involve some temporary configuration changes so that app code is still able to import the code from the new location using the old import paths. These temporary measures will be removed once the forms library is properly packaged and all apps have been updated to import from it as a package, not as a path.

Moving all of this code to a new directory will leave "trailing ends" - relative imports from directories outside of the package root (`src/platform/monitoring`, etc).
We will work towards eliminating these kinds of out-of-package imports.

The new forms library package will also have its own webpack & mocha configuration and can be built separately from the rest of the site. CI builds will always build the forms library, since caching previous builds would add some unwanted complexity.
Unit tests for the forms library _won't_ be run along with all the other tests in each CI build.

- The `vets-website` repo will be configured so that any changes to `src/platform/packages/forms-library` must pass a required check in CircleCI which will run all of the forms library tests
- Forms library unit tests won't be run in PRs where only application code is being changed
- This forms library-specific build process will happen so that engineers will _not_ be committing the built files and folders to git

Once the forms library is actually a package, app code will be updated to import from it directly.

### Code Location

The forms library package will live in `src/platform/packages/forms-library`.
Since it will be a Node package, it will be added to the `package.json` file and apps will import it as a regular Node package instead of by its path in the repo.

### Testing Plan

We have an ESLint rule (`import/no-unresolved-modules`) in place which can verify that the right JS is imported as it relates to the forms library.
Additionally, many of the end-to-end tests will fail if the forms library is not imported properly, so they will help with awareness.

We don't have any automation in place to validate that the right SASS files are imported (other than webpack failing to resolve the file), so testing that forms styling is working properly will be a manual process using the browser dev tools.
This manual testing is low risk and will involve:

- Identifying an HTML node that uses a CSS class defined in the forms library
- Building & running the site
- Navigating to the page where the specific HTML node is used
- Inspecting the element
- Ensuring that the forms library class is applying the expected styles

### Logging

N/A

### Debugging

Since this project isn't about changing functionality of the forms library, we don't need to add any debugging tools. Validating that the app code can still access the forms library in its new location will be enough.

### Caveats

Though we will be creating a package for the forms library, we will not be following semantic versioning since it is _just_ a package and not a published module.
The additional overhead of updating the forms-library's `package.json` file and updating the `yarn.lock` file in `vets-website` to target the newest (but unpublished) version would be a burden without much benefit.

### Security Concerns

N/A

### Privacy Concerns

N/A

### Open Questions and Risks

#### Do we want to run forms library unit tests on each CI build+deploy

The current plan is to run forms library unit tests each time the forms library source is changed. Would we gain any additional protection by also running these on each deploy?

### Work Estimates

Note: These estimates do not account for time spent on other team duties such as support requests.

#### Fix Application Entanglement

**Estimate:** ~ 2 days

1. Move the app-specific code mentioned in [Application Entanglement](#application-entanglement) outside the forms library directories.

#### Preparation

**Estimate:** < 1 day

1. Use the `no-unresolved-modules` ESLint plugin to [find & remove unused code](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/8763) in the `forms` and `forms-library` directories

#### Beginning the bundling

This work should all be done together in one PR, so that the changed location of files won't cause any errors.

**Estimate:** ~ 4 days

1. Copy what remains from `forms` into `forms-system`, removing any duplicate files
1. Create `platform/packages/forms-library` and move the contents of `platform/forms-system` into it
1. Add a `package.json` file to the new `forms-library` package directory
    - Any dependencies that are exclusively used by the forms library will go in here, and a `yarn install` from the `vets-website` root will install them.
    - Shared dependencies (like `react` and `react-redux`) will be configured to be [peer dependencies](https://flaviocopes.com/npm-peer-dependencies/)
1. Add this new package as a symlinked dependency in the `vets-website` package.json file
1. [Add a temporary alias to the `.babelrc` file](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/055d96c54e1df54138b9efc589b98e55962333b3/.babelrc#L50-L55) that redirects imports from `platform/forms` and `platform/forms-system` to the new package
1. Edit the webpack config & use a custom `sass-loader` importer to _temporarily_ rewrite imports from `forms` to `forms-system`
    - This will prevent webpack from failing when it can't resolve the `.scss` files
1. Fix broken relative imports
1. Add babel configuration to the new package because according to [Babel's docs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files):
    > Searching [for a config] will stop once a directory containing a `package.json` is found, so a relative config only applies within a single package

#### Clarifying boundaries

**Estimate:** ~ 5 days

The [Platform Entanglement](#platform-entanglement) section mentions that forms library code imports from "parent" platform code. This makes the boundaries less clear, so an effort will be made to reduce or eliminate the forms library importing from platform code.

- Move the [`static-data/labels` file](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/58c48c6fd116db6e875162f540a0d072678a68d2/src/platform/static-data/labels.jsx) into the forms library, since it is only used in connection with forms library configuration
- Prefer code that exists in the forms library, instead of in the parent platform directory.
  - Anything used by the forms library should be _in_ the forms library, or declared as a dependency.
  - For example, we have a [`focusElement`](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/46000a4becae29ca72b505889713fd4b2b2718f0/src/platform/utilities/ui/index.js#L17-L32) that exists in `platform/utilities/ui`, but also one that exists in [`forms-system/src/js/utilities/ui`](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/46000a4becae29ca72b505889713fd4b2b2718f0/src/platform/forms-system/src/js/utilities/ui/index.js#L3-L18). This project would eliminate the duplicate code existing at the platform level and direct all imports to use the forms library version
- Remove imports from `platform/monitoring` _where feasible_
  - Instead, import the relevant code outside of the forms library and pass them in as props or config options.
  - As an example, in the [`FormSignInModal`](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/1cc955b8d4f6b9f93f4553fdd4afa9878c75564f/src/platform/forms/save-in-progress/FormSignInModal.jsx#L12) component, remove the `platform/monitoring/record-event` import and instead put that function call inside of the function that gets passed as a prop. `FormSignInModal` is only used from `platform/site-wide`.
  - Removing imports of `<DowntimeNotification>` will be covered in Future Work
- Remove forms library dependence on platform re-implementations of 3rd party functions, like lodash's `get` and `set`. Use the forms library implementations where possible.
- Remove imports for `src/platform/utilities/environment` and instead rely on global `const`s from webpack's DefinePlugin for environment-related `const`s (i.e. an api url) or branching

#### Package configuration

**Estimate:** 3-5 days

This is separate from updating the imports. We want the forms library not to depend on the "global" webpack & mocha configuration for `vets-website`, so we will add appropriate config files so that it can be built and tested as a standalone package.

- New webpack & mocha configuration files for the forms library
  - The webpack config will need to specify all of the `entry` fields (`components`, `definitions`, `pages`, ...) that applications will be importing from
    - Having the build output organized like this will allow imports to be structured like: `import { address } from 'forms-library/definitions'`, rather than having everything be bundled into a single file.
  - The `src/platform/packages` directory will also be excluded from the root-level `vets-website` webpack config
- CircleCI config to run forms library unit test on forms library changes
- `vets-website` changes to webpack & mocha config/scripts to prevent the forms library from getting built & tested as part of each PR
- Add an `.eslintrc` file to the new forms library package and configure `no-restricted-imports` to block imports from application code and platform code.


#### Final touches (updating app code)

By this point, the package will already exist, but due to some babel and webpack config it will be masquerading as if it were still spread across `platform/forms` and `platform/forms-system`. This is where we open a PR for each app team and update their code to import directly from the new package. Separate PRs for each app team will make each one easier to merge without requiring a codeowner review from every single team.

- Update app code to use forms library JS & SCSS from the package instead of by direct path. This will help to establish the boundaries of the package for VFS teams.
- Configure the `no-restricted-imports` ESLint rule to [restrict imports of `src/platform/packages` directly](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-restricted-imports)
- Remove the `.babelrc` forms-library alias & custom SASS importer

Once app teams approve these PRs that we create, we will be able to remove those temporary configs and add an ESLint rule to prevent direct imports from `platform/packages/forms-library` in order to make sure that the forms library is treated like a package moving forward.

Actual active time here will be fairly low (1-2 days), and will involve waiting for app teams before we will be able to finish the platform changes.

### Alternatives

See the section [Separate repo](#separate-repo) in Future Work. We are avoiding turning the forms library into its own node module with a separate repo because of the additional overhead of:

- publishing the package
- setting up CI pipelines
- additional repo management.

This _may_ be a path for the future.

Another reason why we don't want to do this right now is that we would lost the advantage of the ESLint configuration that is part of `vets-website`.
Once this configuration is published we will be able to import it into any repo, and at that point it may make sense to move the forms library out of `vets-website`.

#### Yarn workspaces

Yarn workspaces were considered as a solution to this, they are added complexity without any significant benefit.
We can use `yarn add link:./src/platform/packages/forms-library` to add the forms library to the `vets-website` package.json file and have it symlinked in the lock file automatically.

### Future Work

#### Further disentangling

Some of the directories mentioned in [Platform Entanglement](#platform-entanglement) will require larger, out-of-scope refactoring. This includes:

- imports of `<DowntimeNotification>` from `platform/monitoring`
- imports of `toggleLoginModal` from `platform/site-wide`
- imports of `logOut` and `removeSavedForm` from `platform/user`

One option would be to create sibling packages to `forms-library` (each with their own webpack config, etc.) so that the forms library can declare these external dependencies and import them as a package.

Another option would be to refactor the code so that these imports are no longer necessary.

#### Separate repo

One possible option would be to take the package out of `vets-website` and give it its own repo.
With this, we could publish it to npm, and we could completely remove the forms build & test process from `vets-website` repo, possibly speeding things up since we could avoid running forms tests on every build.

#### Tighter dependencies

Since the forms library will have its own `package.json`, we can treat it more like a product that we provide to VFS teams. It will be separate from the rest of the code in `vets-website`, so we could eliminate lodash from the forms library, or replace `moment` with something more appropriate without affecting the rest of the frontend.

Additionally, it might make more sense if we bundled `react-jsonschema-form` in with the forms library. This would help make the forms library feel more cohesive.

Part of the forms library uses re-implementations of 3rd party functions from lodash in the `utilities/data` directory. Several of these usages could be replaced with "native" or vanilla versions ([example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/32f6e006b36f9cbaa749ff33e41df322a4934d7f/src/platform/forms/save-in-progress/SaveInProgressIntro.jsx#L52)), and where that isn't possible we could add a dependency to `package.json` rather than reinvent the wheel.
