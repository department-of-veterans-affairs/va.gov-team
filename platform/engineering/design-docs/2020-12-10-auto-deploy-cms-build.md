## Overview

### Objective

This document explores an approach to running automatic deploys (auto-deploys) of content built using CMS (content management system) export data.
The approach also considers a feasible frequency for the build and deploy that does not overload the build system.

This document _does not_ discuss the design of the full build and deploy using CMS export data.

The intended audience are front-end (FE) and DevOps engineers on the Veteran-facing Services Platform (VSP) and the CMS teams.

### Background

#### Content build and transformers

The VA.gov website is built from the `vets-website` repo. The build outputs static HTML content, React applications, and styling.

The static content is built through a Metalsmith pipeline using data pulled from the Drupal-based CMS and the [`vagov-content` repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vagov-content/).

Currently, the data from the Drupal server is fetched with a GraphQL query. However, the GraphQL-based build has limitations in maintainability and scalability, so an alternative is being developed to replace it.

This implementation, the CMS export build, involves the [use of transformers](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/cms-integration) to transform CMS export data into a content model that matches that of the GraphQL data.

The CMS export data is a JSON static file representation of the content in the Drupal database.
- It's fetched as a tar file that contains a collection of JSON files.
- The files represent both Drupal node and non-node content (which includes, but is not limited to, paragraphs, taxonomy, and menu items).

Transformers act as a [data transformation layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation) to change the CMS Export data into a format the templates can digest.

In the same manner as the GraphQL data, the transformed CMS export data would then be applied to the Liquid templates to generate the HTML files in the build.

The VA.gov website can be deployed to production through the partial (or content-only) deploy or the full deploy.

The **full deploy** builds from _the latest commit of `vets-website`_ and the latest content downloaded from the Drupal server.

The **partial, content-only deploy** builds from the _latest release-tagged commit of `vets-website`_ and the latest content downloaded from the Drupal server.

Both deploys share the same Jenkins pipeline, described by the `deploys/warn-release-deploy` [Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/ansible/Jenkinsfiles/deploys/warn-release-deploy) in the `devops` repo.
- There is a `use_latest_release` flag passed as a parameter to the pipeline that determines which deploy is run.
  - This value is true for partial deploys in order to build from the latest release.
  - This value is false for full deploys in order to build from the latest commit.
- If the commit used in either deploy failed its build, the deploy will also fail.
- Either deploy can be manually invoked, independently of the daily schedule.

There is an existing [automatic full deploy job scheduled to run at 2:00pm ET daily](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/ansible/deployment/config/jenkins-vetsgov/seed_job.groovy#L255-L294). It runs an additional [pre-release job](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/ansible/deployment/config/jenkins-vetsgov/seed_job.groovy#L250) ([`builds/vets-website-content-vagovprod`](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/ansible/deployment/config/jenkins-vetsgov/seed_job.groovy)) defined in [`Jenkinsfile.content`](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/master/Jenkinsfile.content) in the `vets-website` repo.

To deploy content changes at will, that "auto-deploy" job is manually triggered with the `use_latest_release` flag by the CMS team or CMS users with the `Content Admin` or `Content Publisher` roles.

#### Pain points

- Content writers want to quickly draft, publish, and deploy content.
  - However, `vets-website` is only deployed to production once per day.
  - The CMS team can run content-only deploys independently of the daily production deploy, but that is triggered manually.
- The content-only deploy does not include automated accessibility checks.
- In local development, engineers can encounter confusing build errors that are due to the mismatch in outdated locally cached content and updated Liquid templates.

### High Level Design

There will be a new content-only auto-deploy job in addition to the existing full auto-deploy.
- It will build content with CMS export data.
- It will be a recurring job that executes on a more frequent schedule than the daily prod deploy.

The initial schedule will run between 8am and 8pm ET to align with CMS support hours.
- At first, it will be set to run hourly as a conservative cadence.
- It will then be incrementally adjusted to a higher frequency as the build system allows.

To avoid deploying when content hasn't changed since the previous deploy, the job will compare the export data (e.g., using and archiving the checksums of the tarballs).

To differentiate between the auto-deploys, we will refer to the new one as the **content-only auto-deploy** and the existing one as the **daily or full auto-deploy**.

## Specifics

### Detailed Design

#### Creating a new job

The content-only auto-deploy will be configured as a [seed job](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/ansible/deployment/config/jenkins-vetsgov/seed_job.groovy) (e.g., `deploys/vets-gov-autodeploy-content`) in the `devops` repo. It should also be possible to manually trigger it.

We will leverage the existing full auto-deploy job (`deploys/vets-gov-autodeploy-vets-website`) by having the content-only auto-deploy invoke it.
- The `use_latest_release` flag will be set to `true` and the `release_wait` will be set to 0.
- Since the content-only auto-deploy will be a recurring job, there are some concerns around potential conflicts with daily deploys.
- Having the new job invoke `deploys/vetsgov-autodeploy-vets-website` will allow both auto-deploys to share a queue in Jenkins and avoid conflicts.
- CMS stakeholders can still manually trigger the existing job for content-only deploys as before.

The Jenkinsfile for the content-only deploy (e.g., `ansible/Jenkinsfiles/deploys/content-only-autodeploy`) would contain this fundamental step:
```
stage('Autodeploy content') {
  steps {
    build job: 'deploys/vets-gov-autodeploy-vets-website', parameters: [
      stringParam(name: 'release_wait', value: '0'),
      booleanParam(name: 'use_latest_release', value: true),
    ], wait: true
  }
}
```

#### Using the CMS export to build content

In order for the content-only auto-deploy to use the CMS export data, the [build command](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/master/jenkins/common.groovy#L189) in the `build` function in `jenkins/common.groovy` will have to include the `--use-cms-export` flag.

As it's a content-only deploy, it will build using the latest release instead of the latest commit of of `vets-website`.
- This matches the behavior of the current content-only deploy.
- The daily production deploy will continue deploying from the latest commit and retain the responsibility of tagging releases.

If this work is done before the full build has transitioned to using the CMS export, the inclusion of the flag will be contingent on the `contentOnly` parameter to the function.

#### Validating the build

The implementation of the full CMS export build pipeline is expected to introduce a step that compares the diffs between GraphQL and CMS export builds.
- That validation should be included in this pipeline as well while it's being rolled out.
- The comparison step will be removed once the CMS export build is fully released.

For now, the job will not retry or re-queue upon failure.
- Such failures might be related to build diffs, broken links, or other validations.
- The goal is for the job to recur at more frequent intervals, so we can look for a successful run in the next scheduled deploy.

#### Deploying the build

The pipeline will archive the CMS export build in S3 at a different key than the current GraphQL builds.

For example, it might be `s3://vetsgov-website-builds-s3-upload/cms-export/${ref}/${envName}.tar.bz2`, where `ref` is the commit hash and `envName` is the environment (one of `vagovdev`, `vagovstaging`, or `vagovprod`).

The subpath `cms-export` in the key will namespace the archived CMS export build separately from the current GraphQL build. This will enable testing and debugging of the new pipeline without intefering with the current deploy process.

#### Scheduling the deploy

The pipeline will [use a cron trigger](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#triggers) to run on the desired schedule.

The initial schedule will be hourly between 8am and 8pm on weekdays. Ideally, the deploy would run every 5 minutes.

```
node('vagov-autodeploy') {
  triggers {
    cron('0 8-21 * * 1-5')
  }

  dir('vets-website') {
    ...
  }

  stage('Build') {
    ...
  }
}
```

#### Preventing deploys of existing content

On successful deploys, the tarball containing the CMS export data used in the build should be archived in S3. A possible key might be `s3://vetsgov-website-builds-s3-upload/cms-export/data/latest.tar.bz2`.

The CMS export build [currently reads the tarball directly from the response body](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/master/src/site/stages/build/drupal/api.js#L147) and should be modified to save it to a file.

Then on subsequent deploys, the tarball downloaded from Drupal will be compared with the tarball of the previous successful deploy. The build will run only if the MD5 checksums of the two tarballs differ. This ensures that we only run the build when content has changed.

For convenience, we could also upload the checksum to `s3://vetsgov-website-builds-s3-upload/cms-export/data/checksum.txt`. With that, the pipeline would not have to download the full tarball for the comparison.

To help content editors know when the content has been last updated, we might want to timestamp when a new tarball is used and include that info in the generated `BUILD.txt`.

### Code Location

The configuration for the content-only autodeploy will be in the `devops` repo.
- The job and its cron trigger will be configured as a [seed job](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/ansible/deployment/config/jenkins-vetsgov/seed_job.groovy).
- The Jenkinsfile for the job will be in `ansible/Jenkinsfiles/deploys/content-only-autodeploy`.

Modifications to the build and deploy process itself will be made in the `vets-website` repo.
- The [helper functions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/master/jenkins/common.groovy) used in the build are in `jenkins/common.groovy`.
- Anything specific to the [content-only build pipeline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/master/Jenkinsfile.content) will be in `Jenkinsfile.content`.

### Testing Plan

The following behaviors should be observed cumulatively as they are implemented.
1. Build is stored at the proper location in S3 when the job runs.
2. Job runs on the defined schedule.
3. Deploy doesn't proceed when no new content has been published.

### Logging

On top of the existing build logs, the new content-only deploy will output logs for the new transformation processes in the CMS export build.

### Debugging

The auto-deploy pipeline can be debugged by reading its console output. The S3 bucket can be checked to confirm whether the build has been deployed.

The CMS export build will validate the input and output schemas of the transformers, so errors related to the build itself can be debugged using that output.

As with the full build, during the rollout, there will be a comparison of GraphQL and CMS export builds to report errors when discrepancies between the two are found. The script used for this comparison will have some console output as well as an output JSON file describing the discrepancies.

To determine whether a page exists in the Drupal content, we can go to [`staging.va.gov/drupal/debug/`](staging.va.gov/drupal/debug/). This page is not available in production, however.

### Caveats

To be determined.

### Security Concerns

There are no new security concerns with the auto-deploy. There is no user interaction involved unless we include a manual trigger for use by internal VSP engineers, which still should not present any threat of malicious requests. Denial of service is also not a concern as builds are queued.

### Privacy Concerns

There are no new privacy concerns with the auto-deploy as user data is not involved.

### Open Questions and Risks

#### Questions

- What is the ideal schedule for the content-only auto-deploy?
  - The pipeline will initially run hourly 8am-8pm ET on weekdays.
  - The timeframe aligns with CMS support hours.
  - We want the highest rate of deploy that the system can sustain.

- How should we coordinate the schedule of the content-only auto-deploy with the daily production deploy?
  - The deploys from both pipelines will likely overlap.
  - The daily production deploy is still necessary for tagging the release.
  - [The queue of content-only deploys should naturally resolve conflicts without any special handling.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/18393)

- Is there a way to get the time of the last updated published content in Drupal and use that to determine if we should build or not?
  - If we have access to that information, we may not need to compare the CMS export tarballs.

- Will this new auto-deploy continue fail on broken links?
  - With a high enough rate of deploy, failing on broken links would not be ideal.
  - If we maintain the same error alerting, broken links could spam notifications while being investigated.
  - There has been a [proposed plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/pull/14092) to ignore these errors and upload the CSV of broken links on deploys.
  - For the initial hourly schedule, it may not be necessary to implement the changes for the proposed broken link improvements.
    - An hourly deploy should not generate too many notifications from failures.
    - As we increase the frequency of deploys, we might then want to dedicate some time to modifying the broken link behavior in a parallel effort.

#### Risks

- Newly added content from CMS without associated transformer schemas could fail the build.
  - New content introduces the possibility of new discrepancies, which would fail any validations that depend on diffs between the GraphQL and CMS export builds.
  - Having more content will inflate the runtime of the content-only deploy and could potentially exceed the scheduled interval.
  - The best defense against this is accounting for null and empty fields in transformers.

### Work Estimates

- Create a new content-only deploy job for CMS export builds (5 pts)
- Run the partial deploy on a schedule (3 pts)
- Auto-deploy only new content (3 pts)

### Alternatives

Ideally, content would get deployed immediately as content writers make changes. However, the CMS export process is not suited for multiple invocations in quick succession, so we opted for a process that will essentially batch and deploy content changes as appropriate.

### Future Work

- There are plans to transition from Jenkins to CircleCI for our build pipeline. The auto-deploy job will have to be brought over to CircleCI at that time.
  - The `vets-website` CircleCI infrastructure is hosted on a public domain.
  - CircleCI does not have access to the CMS Drupal server, which is hosted within the internal VA network.
  - To circumvent the need for access to the VA network, we could run a job that keeps an up-to-date cache of the CMS export data.
  - We might consider running that job as a Lambda function or a CodeBuild pipeline.
- To improve the runtime, we might want to explore incremental deploys.
