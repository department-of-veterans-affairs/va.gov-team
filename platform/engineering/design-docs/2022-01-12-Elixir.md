## Overview

### Objective
- Utilize the Elixir programming language to implement an authentication and authorization sign-in service with heavy concurrency and high availability needs
- Foster a community within the organization to share and expand Elixir knowledge, in order to encourage usage towards additional relevant implementations
- The intended audience is engineers within VSP who likely will interact with services that are implemented with the Elixir language. Otherwise there should be little to no requirement of other VA employees to understand Elixir as it's being used by VA.gov.

### Background

  The sign in service is intended to be a new solution for what will eventually be the authentication and authorization flow for all VA.gov users. This service will have clear concurrency and performance needs that do not make it a good candidate for an implementation inside the vets-api monolith, but rather encourage a separation as its own separate service. Additionally, the organization itself has encouraged a microservice approach for new features, and this feature is particularly suited for this new approach. Other reasons for separating this service from the vets-api monolith are to allow for simplified testing, and clear service boundaries. Finally, scalability is a concern for the new sign in service, as authentication and authorization mechanisms in vets-api today represent a bottleneck in the application. Therefore, it is imperative that this service is implemented with performance and concurrency considerations. Otherwise, it is likely that we would necessitate increases in our overall infrastructure instance count, rather than reductions.

  Another driving factor is the current lack of separation of our authentication service offerings. Currently vets-api is handling MHV's sign in through a solution we call the "Unified Sign In Page." This service offering greatly increases the user experience but this is also a very clear service boundary as it has nothing to do with vets-api. It is in the best interest of the Veteran that we continue to onboard authentication for other services through the Identity team. This service boundary definition provides us with the opportunity to better architect the solution and put less burden on vets-api. Simply put, we don't want vets-api handling authentication for a sign in request that has nothing to do with vets-api. We want the VSP managed sign in service to manage authentication for all veteran facing services.

### High Level Design
Use Elixir with Phoenix to create the SignInService and supporting endpoints:
- Highly performant language that allows for potentially 100s of thousands of concurrent connections
- Built on Erlang virtual machine to leverage established stable technology which also allows for “active changes”, “reduced impact of errors”, and non-blocking IO
- Requiring each response to the service to have minimal latency (Elixir performed better in many studies compared to Ruby and Node)
- Ruby's current buckling of high requests results in exponential increase in response time, Elixir has a flat latency response under higher concurrency loads. This is extremely important for the sign in service as we expect to receive inconsistent network latency and exponentially growing requests during “high va.gov traffic hours”.
- Elixir's functional language style more closely resembles the requirements of a well-defined sign in service, which results in the reduction of hours to create tests, maintain, debug, and improve.
- Elixirs Phoenix framework has many similarities to rails, thus resulting in taking advantage of the more performant framework while also reducing the “spin up time” for an engineer to understand the service as it was designed.
Example diagram showing the Phoenix framework is shown below. We will update this document with the architecture of our setup after the first implementation sprint.

## Specifics

### Code Location
Main location: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/sign-in-service

### Testing Plan
- Unit level tests with Phoenix test framework
- Integration testing with emulated requests and set expectations
- Leverage existing infrastructure for load testing
- Sonarqube will be used for security source code scanning
- All web component testing will utilize capybara or Elixir equivalent

### Logging
  We will be using the Phoenix framework which provides similar logging functionality to rails. We will perform a full solution breakdown of all audit requirements of the sign in service but that is out of scope for Elixir and does not impact this design document.

### Debugging
  Use IEx.pry to interact with any component the same as you would Ruby pry. Debugging in Elixir is no different than debugging a rails app, so for the purposes of this document we will not expand further at this time.

### Caveats
_To be determined._

### Security Concerns
  Elixir and the phoenix framework will be deployed as services within our current K8s va.gov infrastructure. There are no additional concerns that are worth noting at this time that are outside of what you would expect when creating an application similar to ruby on rails. In fact Elixirs share nothing concurrency makes this language more secure than many others, including Ruby.

### Privacy Concerns
Privacy concerns are not a direct consideration of the implementation of Elixir within the sign in service.

### Open Questions and Risks
- Are we concerned with the lack of current Elixir knowledge within the VA?
  - Generally we are not because the language is not more complex than Ruby and so similar to Ruby that many of the current Ruby engineers will be able to pick this language up without any issues. The team also intends on creating a community of practice which will provide other teams support with considering and implementing Elixir within any new solutions they have.
  - Likelihood: Moderate
  - Cost: hours spent to build this service would be lost if it was determined that support of the Elixir application was not sustainable
  - Mitigations: 
    - Initial service will be very small (less than 1k loc)
    - Hold Elixir workshops and establish CoP
- What if the response and concurrency do not deliver as expected?
  - We will document the performance of the implemented service and determine if we should continue with Elixir or pivot to another language.
  - Likelihood: Low
  - Cost: hours spent to build this service would be lost if it was determined that support of the Elixir application was not sustainable
  - Mitigations:
    - Reduction of likelihood by measuring the performance throughout the development cycle 

### Work Estimates
The phases of work are as follows:
- The use of Elixir will come with gaining knowledge of the language and its framework Phoenix
  - 4 hours per current Ruby engineer
  - 2 hours per current security engineer
  - 4 hours per supporting engineer (operations, testing) 
- Implement the first service with this language (sign in service), includes initial architecture integration
  - 4 sprints
- Establish CoP for Elixir
  - 1 sprint for initial creation, varies for maintenance and office hours after
- Implement additional services with Elixir as appropriate
  - Varies based on complexity of the current service and solution, however the scaffolding and examples of other applications

### Alternatives
If Elixir does not deliver on the expected advantages we can either pivot to Go or Ruby. The alternatives should be better understood, so we will take a moment to break those down. Elixir is to Ruby as Phoenix/OTP is to Rails. So when it comes to assessing the performance and alternatives, we are focused on the langauge and less so the framework because Elixir is what utilizes Erlang. Erlang provides us with the functional language backbone and ensures we have seamless concurrency. Using something other than Ruby if this solution does not work is not something this team is considering at this point but will revisit upon leadership or technology demand. 

### Future Work
The initial release with Elixir will be the sign in service which will support va.gov. The next two customers will be mobile app and lighthouse. An analysis will be conducted after each of these phased releases to ensure the choice of using Elixir is matching our expectations.
