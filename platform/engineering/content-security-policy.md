# Content Security Policy 

This document is an overview of how Va.gov implements, uses, and manages a content security policy. This document assumes you have an understanding of CSP, CSP directives and a high level understanding of Va.gov's infrastructure (specifically where the reverse proxy sits in the content delivery flow).

## Generation of CSP

There are two components of the CSP generated by Va.gov's reverse proxy. 

- **CSP HTTP headers**: `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` and `Content-Security-Policy` (currently not active) 
- **`nonce` header value and HTML attribute**: A unique value (nonce) is generated for each page visit. The nonce is added to the CSP header and to each occurance of the nonce attribute in the HTML document. The nonce is added to the HTML document with a simple string replacement of `CSP_NONCE`. 

## CSP logger 

Va.gov uses Sentry as its CSP logger. 

**Sentry CSP logs** for each environment: 
- [Production](http://sentry.vfs.va.gov/vets-gov/website-production/?query=is%3Aunresolved+logger%3Acsp)
- [Staging](http://sentry.vfs.va.gov/vets-gov/website-staging/?query=is%3Aunresolved+logger%3Acsp)

_Reports are throttled by the reverse proxy by setting the `report-url` in the CSP header for **only on a percentage** of visits._

## Configuration and maintenance

Must be backwards compatible to CSP 1.0 

## Exempted third party scripts
