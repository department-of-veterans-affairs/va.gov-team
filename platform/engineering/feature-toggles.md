# Feature Toggles
Feature toggles (also known as feature flags or feature flippers) can be used in both vets-api and vets-website to manage unreleased features in a continuous integration environment. Feature toggles enable VFS teams to test out new functionality (applications, features, VA.gov content pages, Metalsmith) in the VSP development, staging, or production environments for a set of users. Teams can enable or disable a feature for all users, a percentage of all users, a percentage of all logged-in users, a list of users, or users defined in a method.

Refer to the [Client application documentation on feature toggles](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/platform/tools/feature-toggles/) for more information.
