# Scheduled Downtime Process for VA.gov

## Overview
Site upgrades, migrations, or changes that affect the public site may result in the site requiring VA.gov services to be taken down. When this is necessary, we need to make sure that the VA.gov users and developers working on the VA.gov platform are sufficiently informed. Please follow the process below in order to allow the right parties to be aware, give enough time for other teams to make any preparations, and to minimize effect to the Veterans and other users of VA.gov. 

## Steps Needed to be Taken to Schedule Downtime On VA.gov

- Document the exact date and time you anticipate the downtime happening and the systems that will be taken down:
    - Systems affected: system name 1, system name 2, etc.
    - Proposed date and time for staging: DayOfWeek, Month Date, YYYY, from h:mm AM/PM to h:mm AM/PM
    - Proposed date and time for production: DayOfWeek, Month Date, YYYY, from h:mm AM/PM to h:mm AM/PM
- Planned downtime should be communicated to the VSP Operations team, and the DEPO Heads of the Platform (@KevinMHoffmanUSDS and Dror Matalon) should review your addition to the downtime schedule
     - Once approved by DEPO, work with the VSP Operations Product Manager (@ricetj), so to add your scheduled downtime can be added to the downtime schedule and VA's Polaris.
- Any changes that will result in downtime for the public website need to be communicated with your DEPO lead 2 Weeks before any planned downtime.
- An announcement at the weekly Team of Teams meeting about the scheduled downtime needs to be made one week in advance of the downtime.
- A notification of the downtime will need to be posted in the #vsa-public-websites channel at least three days in advance, ccing @Jen Lee so that team is aware and that the appropriate parties will be notified.
- An announcement should be made at the same time in #vfs-all-teams, detailing the dates and times approved by the head of platform
