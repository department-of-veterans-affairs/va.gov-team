# ARM: Consuming the Accreditation API – Architecture Intent

For the past 1.5 years, we've relied on a weekly `.XLSX` file from the Office of General Counsel (OGC) containing updated representative and organization data. We sanitize this data and push it to the `va.gov-teams-sensitive` repository. A Sidekiq job runs daily to check if the file has been updated in the last 24 hours. If it has, we retrieve the file, iterate through specific sheets, compare the data, and update records in the `veteran_representatives` and `veteran_organizations` tables as needed.

We are now replacing the manual `.XLSX` file update process with an automated integration that consumes the new Accreditation API developed by OGC. Additionally, we will discontinue the use of the `veteran_representatives` and `veteran_organizations` tables, which were originally created by Lighthouse and later heavily modified by us, in favor of three new tables: `accredited_individuals`, `accredited_organizations`, and `accreditations`. These new tables offer a more structured and flexible data model. Once the transition is complete, we will revert the Lighthouse tables to their original state before our modifications and remove all related code from the `veteran` module, as it will no longer be needed.

To provide context, here are the current record counts in the staging environment, which should be pretty close what's in production:

#### Record Counts in Staging

- **`veteran_representatives`:** 14,191
- **`veteran_organizations`:** 110

This document outlines our approach to transitioning from the `.XLSX` ingest process to automatically consuming the Accreditation API.

## Seeding the New Tables

To avoid unnecessary API calls to the Address Validation API, we will prepopulate the new `accredited_individuals`, `accredited_organizations`, and `accreditations` tables using data from the legacy `veteran_representatives` and `veteran_organizations` tables.

### Steps:

1. **Create a Rake Task**  
   Develop a Rake task to migrate records from the legacy tables to the new schema:

   - Populate the `accredited_organizations` table.
   - Populate the `accredited_individuals` table and create corresponding records in the `accreditations` join table.

2. **Implement Batch Processing**  
   Use Rails' `find_in_batches` and `insert_all` methods to process records in chunks of 1,000. For example:

   ```ruby
   OldModel.find_in_batches(batch_size: 1000) do |batch|
     transformed_records = batch.map do |record|
       {
         new_field1: record.field1,
         new_field2: record.field2,
         # Other necessary transformations
         created_at: Time.current,
         updated_at: Time.current
       }
     end

     # Efficiently insert the transformed batch into the new table
     NewModel.insert_all(transformed_records)
   end
   ```

   This Rake task will be executed once.

### Benefits of This Approach:

- **Optimized Memory Usage** – Only 1,000 records are processed at a time, preventing memory overload.
- **Improved Performance** – Batch inserts reduce the number of database queries, enhancing efficiency.
- **Simplicity** – The migration is an in-place operation, avoiding the complexity of background job systems like Sidekiq.

## Daily Sidekiq Job for Accreditation API Integration

A new daily Sidekiq job will fetch data from the Accreditation API to update the `accredited_individuals`, `accredited_organizations`, and `accreditations` tables.

### Modifications & Logic Adjustments:

#### Soft Deletion

- Add an `is_active` column (default: `true`) to the `accredited_individuals` and `accredited_organizations` tables.
- If an individual or organization is missing from the API response, mark its `is_active` column as `false` rather than deleting the record.

If there's a security concern with persisting inactive individuals indefinitely, we could implement one of the following solutions:

**Secure Soft Deletion:** Instead of simply setting `is_active = false`, null out non-encrypted data fields while storing the original record in an encrypted JSON blob for more secure long-term storage. This ensures that sensitive information is not easily accessible while still retaining the ability to restore or audit historical data if needed.

**Inactive Tables for Historical Data:** Instead of soft deleting records, move inactive representatives and organizations to dedicated `inactive_accredited_individuals` and `inactive_accredited_organizations` tables. These tables would have the same structure as the active ones but store records in an encrypted format. Once a record is moved to its corresponding inactive table, it would be deleted from the active dataset.

Out of these two potential solutions, _Secure Soft Deletion_ would be easier to implement and require fewer schema changes. _Inactive Tables for Historical Data_ would provide better organization and a clearer distinction between active and inactive records.

### Import Logic Updates

Retain core logic from the existing `.XLSX` import process, with the following modifications:

- Insert new records for individuals and organizations that do not yet exist.
- Mark records as inactive (`is_active = false`) if they exist in our database but are absent from the Accreditation API response.
- Compare `raw_address` values to detect address changes.
- Compare `phone` values instead of `phone_number`, since `phone_number` is no longer in use.
- Compare individual names to account for changes (e.g., due to marriage).

### Additional Considerations

- Retain the existing Sidekiq job structure for record updates.
- Determine the appropriate handling of the `can_accept_reject_poa` field.
- If the Accreditation API response includes `created_at` and `updated_at` fields for each record, we can optimize updates by skipping records that have not been created or modified in the last 24 hours, reducing unnecessary processing.

By implementing this architecture, we ensure data consistency, streamline the update process, and improve overall system reliability.
