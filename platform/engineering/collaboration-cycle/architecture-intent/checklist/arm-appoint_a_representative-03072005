# Architecture Intent meeting template

## Instructions

Your document should be brief and high-level. Please keep it to a single page. Focus on the high level and link to supporting material where appropriate; this is _not_ a detailed engineering spec.

Some of the items below may not apply to your work--that's okay. You may not be able to fill in some items that _do_ apply to your work--that's also okay. If you don't have answers, please come ready to ask questions.

## Checklist

- Product description
  - [x] For the past 1.5 years, we've relied on a weekly .XLSX file to be shared with us from OGC with updated representative and organization data that we sanitize and push to the `va.gov-teams-sensitive repo`. A Sidekiq job runs daily to check if the file has been updated in the last 24 hours; if it has been, we grab the file, interate through the records in specific sheets, diff the data, and update records in the `veteran_representatives` and `veteran_organizations` if they need to be updated. We're replacing this XLSX file with the new Accrediation API that GCLAWS built for us.
