# CMS Collaboration cycle kickoff request
Before engaging with the CMS Collaboration Cycle, please review the guidance and questions below to help the CMS team determine what level of support, which practice areas, and which touchpoints are needed for your work. If you don’t know the answer to a question, then it may be too early for you to engage with the CMS Collaboration Cycle.

**Are you ready to engage with the Collaboration Cycle?**

If yes, then your Product Manager should submit the [CMS Collaboration Cycle Request ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/new?assignees=BerniXiongA6&labels=CMS+Team%2C+Needs+Analysis%2C+CMS-Collab-Cycle%2C+Epic&projects=&template=cms-collaboration-cycle-request.yml&title=CMS+Collaboration+Cycle+for+%5BTeam+Name%2C+Product+Name%2C+Feature+Name%5D) and answer the kickoff questions. We'll update that Epic with recommended touchpoints and respond in the Slack post that you create.

# Kickoff artifacts

It is the Product Manager’s responsibility to ensure the product outline is attached to the Epic.
The team building on the CMS is responsible for providing all relevant and up-to-date links, screenshots, images, and designs of the product's as-is version.

# Questions about your product or feature:
If you need more information about how to answer some of the questions that are asked in the kickoff ticket, you can find that below. These questions help us determine which practice areas to involve on the CMS team and which touchpoints that we recommend to your team.

## Will you be doing user research with CMS editors?

We ask this question to determine if a research review touchpoint is necessary.

Examples of research with CMS Editors include:

- Usability testing
- User surveys
- Card sorting
  
   
## Will your work result in visible changes to the user experience of the CMS?

We ask this question to determine if a design intent touchpoint is necessary.

Examples of **visible changes** include:

- Any changes that the user will see
- Adding a new form, tool, or page
- Modifying buttons, design elements, interactions, or page layouts
- Reordering content, adding new calls to action, alert boxes, expandable sections, or error messages

Examples of **no visible changes** include:

- Changes to code that the user won’t see
- Changes to accessible labels (aria-label, aria-labelledby, aria-describedby)

## Will your work require introducing a new CMS Design System component or changes to an existing component?

We ask this question to determine if there will need to be a [CMS Design System Experimental Addition Request](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/new?assignees=BlakeOrgan&labels=CMS+design+system%2C+CMS+design%2C+CMS+Team%2C+Needs+refining&projects=&template=cms-design-system-experimental-addition-request.md&title=Experimental+Design+for+%5Bcomponent+or+pattern+name%5D).

   
## Will your work require introducing a new Drupal module or changes to an existing module?

We ask this question to determine if a module review touchpoint is necessary.

Any new modules or changes to existing modules will need to be reviewed and approved by a designer, accessibility specialist, and developer on the CMS team before becoming a part of the CMS.

## Will your work require introducing new input fields or making changes to existing input fields?

If your CMS work might result in content data changing, you must ensure that all front ends that use that data are also changed.

Examples of field changes that require CMS Team review:
- Changing cardinality / allowed number of values
- Changing translatability
- Reusing an existing field on a new content type
- etc.
  
Examples of field changes that don't require CMS Team review:
- Updating help text, field label, or default value
- Changing the field widget settings
- Referencing an existing field on a new content type
- etc.


## Will this work require you to capture any analytics or metrics?


We ask this question to determine if an Analytics Request touchpoint is necessary.



## Will this work require creating/editing any CMS Knowledge Base articles?

We ask this question to determine if the CMS Help Desk will need to review any CMS Knowledge Base articles.

- If a Knowledge Base article will need to be created or updated, you can use the "[Knowledge Base article - Create or update](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Knowledge+Base%2C+Needs+refining&projects=&template=knowledge-base-article.md&title=Create+new+KB+article+or+update++existing+article+%3A+%3Cinsert+topic+here%3E)" ticket template for your team to make the necessary changes.
- If a Knowledge Base article will need to be reviewed by the CMS team, you can use the "[Knowledge Base article - Review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Knowledge+Base%2C+Needs+refining&projects=&template=knowledge-base-article-review.md&title=Review+of+new+or+updated+KB+article+%3A+%3Cinsert+topic+here%3E)" ticket template for the CMS team to review your article before publishing to the Knowledge Base.
