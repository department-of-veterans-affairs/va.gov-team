# Collaboration cycle
The Collaboration Cycle is where teams who are building products/features on the Drupal Content Management System (CMS) get feedback and guidance on their product/feature to ensure it meets experience standards for design, content, information architecture, quality assurance, accessibility, and research. Teams engage with the Collaboration Cycle throughout their product’s/feature’s lifecycle.

## How it works
The Collaboration Cycle is a series of touchpoints during which teams building on the CMS get guidance on the following areas:
- Design
- Content
- Information Architecture
- Quality Assurance
- Accessibility
- Research
- Analytics
- Privacy & Security
- Help Desk / Knowledge Base
