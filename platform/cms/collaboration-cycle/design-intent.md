# Design Intent
Did the CMS team recommend a Design Intent in your CMS Collaboration Cycle Request ticket? If so, follow the guidelines below to get started.

## Owner
CMS Team

## Timing
Request this touchpoint when you have an idea of how to solve the problem statement provided in your Product Outline and have at minimum drafted the artifacts listed down in the "Required design artifacts" section of this page.

Design Intent meetings require a 2 day lead time before a meeting is held. This is required in order to allow enough time for a Designer on the CMS team to review your artifacts and prepare their feedback for your team.

## Format
Synchronous 30-minute meeting

## Meeting request
To request a Design Intent touchpoint meeting with the CMS team, the Product Manager for your team should follow the "Before Meeting" steps in the Design Intent section of your Collaboration Cycle Request epic. Need help finding your ticket? All CMS Collaboration Cycle Requests can be viewed on the [CMS Collaboration Cycle Reviews](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/cms-collaboration-cycle-reviews-62f50368ef32b60022d76d64/board) ZenHub board.

## Meeting attendees
Required participants from your team:
- Designer(s)
- Product Manager

The participants above will not be invited to the meeting by the CMS team. The Product Manager for your team is responsible for ensuring everyone required to be in attendance from your team is invited. We encourage you to invite other members of your team as well, including:
- Content, IA, accessibility, and QA specialists who will be working on the product
- Other VA stakeholders

The CMS Team is responsible for determining the required participants on their team and inviting them to your Design Intent touchpoint meeting.

## Required design artifacts
When scheduling your Design Intent meeting, your team will be required to provide design artifacts that the CMS Team can review prior to holding your meeting. Your team can provide any of the following types of artifacts, but must at minimum provide the required artifacts.

- User flow (required)
- Whiteboard sketch
- Lo-fi or hi-fi prototypes
- Wireframes
- User personas
- Research plan
- Diagrams
- Any other relevant artifacts you have so far

## Objective
For your team to get high-level feedback from the CMS team on the user experience of your proposed design solution.

After reading over the Product Outline provided by your team, the CMS Team uses this meeting to gain a deeper understanding of your product/feature, including the goals/direction of the product, the intended user flow, and the overall scope of the initiative.

## Agenda
This is the first opportunity for the CMS Team to view your product and the proposed solution to your problem statement provided as part of your Product Outline. You’ll introduce your new work initiative and discuss existing solutions in the problem space. You’ll walk through the user flow and  present any other relevant design artifacts.

The CMS team will then ask questions and provide feedback relevant to the product.

## Moderator script
Each Design Intent meeting begins with the CMS Team moderator reading the moderator script.

This script ensures that everyone participating in the meeting and everyone watching the recording after the meeting understands why the meeting takes place, how it will proceed, and how teams should expect to receive feedback from the CMS Team.

**The script reads as follows:**

"Welcome to the Design Intent for _______ team for ______ initiative.

The Design Intent meeting is intended to be a collaboration touchpoint between teams building on the Drupal content management system and the CMS Platform Team. We ask that you first introduce your new work initiative to us and discuss the problem space you are trying to solve for. It’s helpful to learn of any constraints you were facing. Then, present your design artifacts and walk us through the user flow. Please limit your presentation on your work initiative and artifacts to 10 minutes to ensure reviewers have enough time to provide feedback. I will give you a one-minute warning. Next, any CMS Team reviewers on the Zoom will ask questions and provide feedback relevant to the product. We will help guide you to existing design components, research findings, and share relevant examples from other CMS work. We will also communicate any information to ensure you’re building a product that meets CMS Platform Team standards. Feedback will be given in a Must/Should/Consider format. Please note that "Must" feedback, if not addressed, could result in launch-blocking issues. By not addressing the "Must" feedback, your team accepts the risk of being blocked from launch to the Drupal CMS Platform. Please handle accordingly."

## Outcome
CMS Team reviewers will document their feedback following the Must, Should, and Consider Framework, if applicable. Feedback tickets will be linked to the Collaboration Cycle Request ticket and available no later than EOD the next business day following the meeting.


In addition, the CMS Team may:
- Recommend applicable Design System components and/or patterns
- Identify needs for creating/updating Design System components and/or patterns
- Share relevant insights/flows/examples from other CMS work
- Identify your product as a candidate for experimental design
- Recommend early engagement with other teams that this work might impact
