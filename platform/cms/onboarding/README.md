# Welcome to the VFS-CMS Team! 👋
We're thrilled to have you join us on this journey! 🎆🎉🙌

Our vision is to build and maintain a best-in-class Content Management System that meets the needs of editors, application development teams, and consuming applications in order to empower our users to help Veterans.

We ask that you create a GitHub issue using [this template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Onboarding&template=cms-team-and-sitewide-crew-member-onboarding.md&title=Onboarding%3A+%3Cinsert_name%3E) which will walk you through the steps needed to onboard.

Have fun and we look forward to getting to know you! 😊
