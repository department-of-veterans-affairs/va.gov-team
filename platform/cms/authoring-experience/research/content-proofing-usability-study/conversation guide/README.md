# Conversation Guide for Content Proofing Usability Study
## Introduction - 5 min

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jordana and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about [TDB].
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, **we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session**, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

**Once you are recording:** I want to verify that you are okay with me recording screen and audio today.

## [TDB] Background - 5 min

Think back to a recent time when you visited a VA facility. If you're comfortable, will you describe that situation briefly? 
- Can you tell me where you went?
- What type of facility was it (urgent care, emergency, community care, etc)?
- Do you remember how you learned about that facility and what made you choose to go to it?
- Is there anything you wish you would have known about the location before your visit?

Have you ever looked up a facility on VA.gov? 
[If yes] What were you looking for? Did you find what you needed?
[If no] How could a facility locator be helpful to you on VA.gov?

**(share link)** I'm going to share a link with you. Once it loads, will you share your screen with me?

## [TDB] Usability Test - 15 min
I'm going to ask you a few questions about the site. While we look at the website, Iâ€™m going to ask you to think out loud, working a little more slowly than you might work normally while looking at the web. Talk me through what you are doing.

### Task 1 - Search & Navigation
Let's imagine that you have a medical situation that requires you to visit a local VA facility. If you used the website, what would you do?

(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)

### Task 2 - Choosing & Learning
[If they landed on the VA Locations search results]

Using the map, how would you choose the facility you want to visit?

Now, let's take a look at the list of facilities. Which location would you select to visit and why?  
(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)

### Task 3 - Prepping to Visit
[If still on search results]

Go ahead and select the location you would visit. Scroll through this screen and talk me through what information would be helpful for your upcoming visit.

[Follow up if they didn't choose "Find VA Locations" in header] Will you return to the homepage? Let's say you don't have a medical situation, but need to visit a VA facility for another reason, how would you do that from this page?

## [TDB] Post-test Questions - 10 min
I have just a few more questions to ask you before we finish up today.
- From a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being extremely dificult, 5 being extremely easy), how would rate the ease of finding the VA facility you needed?
- What would you say the difference is between urgent care, community care, and emergency facilities?
- What information do you need to see online in order to visit a facility? i.e. phone number, address, services, etc.

## Closing - 5 min
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the CMS tool and make sure it really works for you.

[TDB] As a thank you for your participation, we'd like to offer you a $50 thank-you gift. Is it ok for us to send that gift to the same address Shannon and Brian used to communicate with you about scheduling this test? [If no] Ok, we'll follow up with an email after this session to get the right email from you in writing.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
