# Research Plan for VFS-CMS tool, February 2020

## Goals
This research plan is for the VFS-CMS Tool - VFS-CMS team.

The VFS-CMS tool is VA.gov's content management system that provides the structured content templates, workflows and governance that help various teams at VA serve veterans accurate, accessible, up-to-date content.

Our objective for this research is to **identify VFS-CMS user personas and understand their experience with the Content Editing and the CMS Onboarding journeys**. 

#### Hypothesis: 
Our hypothesis is that we will be able to identify a first version of VFS-CMS user personas based on the way that they experience the the _content editing_ and _CMS onboarding_ journeys.

#### Personas key attributes
* Work priorities
* Main workflows
* Content authority
* Drupal CMS proficiency
* Frequency of Drupal CMS usage
* Drupal CMS vocabulary
* Support preferences

## Method	
Our approach will help us uncover first-hand stories of key phases of the journeys, in adition to gaining an understanding of behavioral patterns. Each in-person session will be composed of one-on-one moderated interviews and journey mapping. In cases where in-person sessions are not possible, the sessions will be conducted via Zoom. We'll watch for emotions, mindsets, motivations, actions, pain-points and needs.

###### In-person sessions
* Conversation guide
* Post-its
* Zoom recording

###### Remote sessions
* Conversation guide
* Smaply journey template
* Zoom recording

To record the session, we'll make an initial record using verbatim notes and zoom audio and screen recording, followed by synthesized notes on our observations.

To protect PII, we will follow data management protocols outlined by [VFS-CMS research procedures](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/cms/authoring-experience/research/research-procedures).

## Participants and Recruitment	
Due to the narrow user base for statistically representative personas, three _user groups_ were selected in the editorial workflow spectrum based on work commonalities. Research participants will be selected within each _user group_. We seek to identify behavioral patterns unique to each _user group_.

###### VSA Public Website Teams - 5 participants
* Regularly contribute feature enhancement ideas
* Experienced Drupal CMS users
* Their content requires more governance (Tier 1)
* Work with several stakeholders across VA business
* Closely aligned with the content, design and IA platform team
###### Web Manager and VAMC PAOs - 2 participants
* VAMC content editors
* Are at the receiving end of design intentions
* Manage VAMC banner alerts, which can have life or death implications
* Much of their content is Tier 2 or 3, not necessarily veteran-facing
###### Content Stakeholders - 4 participants
* Content reviewers
* Work with people who use the Drupal CMS tool

Interview invitations to be done directly via email
