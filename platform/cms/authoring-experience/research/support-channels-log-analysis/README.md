# Research Plan for VFS-CMS tool, February 2020 
As a member of the CMS team design pod, I need to establish a process for analyzing interactions between CMS users and the CMS team, so that I can identify common themes to inform research and design.	

## Goals
This research plan is for the VFS-CMS Tool - VFS-CMS team.

The VFS-CMS tool is VA.gov's content management system that provides the structured content templates, workflows and governance that help various teams at VA serve veterans accurate, accessible, up-to-date content.

VFS-CMS users and team members have established official channels for questions and answers regarding the VFS-CMS tool via email and the #cms-support Slack channel. This study aims to identify patterns in the content of these support channels to better understand the nature of the demands and identify opportunities for improvement.

### Research Questions
- What are the most prominent usability considerations regarding the CMS tool?
- What language do CMS users use to describe their work and problems?
- What kinds of opportunities do these findings provide to refine CMS trainings?
- What CMS documentation needs exist for different teams?

## Method	
For this study, we will use _Thematic Analysis_ to analyze transcripts of conversations between the CMS team and users. By identifying overarching themes, we can better understand users' paint points and needs.

Data management will follow the [VFS-CMS research procedures](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/cms/authoring-experience/research/research-procedures) to protect PII.

### Target Channels
The conversations will be extracted from:
* <b>_#cms-support_ Slack channel</b> - Responsible: Jordana Mello (jordana.mello@agile6.com)
* <b>VA CMS support email</b> - Responsible: XXX

### Data Sample
