# Conversation Guide for Assignments and Editorial Workflow Usability Study

## Introduction

_(About 5 minutes)_

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Jordana, and I'm a designer and researcher for the VA.gov CMS. I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes for me. Today we're going to be testing a new way for CMS users to review and move content in the editorial workflow. During this test, I will ask you to share your screen so that I can follow along with you.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the new CMS to better meet your needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

* You'll be interacting with a prototype during this session. This means that you will be interacting with a replica of CMS, but some areas may be clickable while others aren't.

* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

I want to verify that you are okay with me recording screen and audio today.
