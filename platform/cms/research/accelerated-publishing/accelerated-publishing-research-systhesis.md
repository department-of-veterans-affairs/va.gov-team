**Accelerated Publishing: Aggregated Research Session Report**

[Project Directory](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/cms/accelerated_publishing)

Currently, the technical architecture that supports CMS content being pushed to VA.gov causes a publishing delay. When a CMS editor saves content as published, there is a 1-hour delay before it goes live on VA.gov. 
The CMS team is currently exploring how to re-architect the deployment process to reduce or eliminate delays. We believe that better understanding the needs and pain points for CMS editors across the VA ecosystem will help inform a technical solution that improves CMS editor's work.


[Research Goals & Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/cms/research/accelerated-publishing/accelerated-publishing.md)

The goal of this study is to understand what kinds of needs, pain points, or expectations exist among CMS editors that might inform the technical solution for accelerated publishing.

**Methodology**

We conducted six (6) user interviews with a walkthrough of the current publishing workflow. This helped us identify where the users' content goals intersect with the interface as they go through the publishing workflow.

* Facilitated user interviews were conducted remotely via Zoom with the following areas of focus:
* Background/context questions to determine what kind of content participants  work with and how those content types relate to the publishing process
* Walkthrough of publishing workflow, editing a form of content pertinent to the editor's work, including saving as published, and reviewing proofing page

# Participant Description

- 6 CMS editors:
  - 2 VAMC field editors 
  - 1 VAMC Upgrade Team member
  - 2 Sitewide Content team members
  - 1 VACO stakeholder

# Key Findings

1. **Poor publishing UX:** The CMS interface doesn’t tell editors when their content will go live.
2. **Faster = better(*):** Most editors believed that quicker publishing would benefit their work as long as it didn’t negatively impact complexities with deployments and cross-linked content.
3. **Delay = inefficiency + stress:** Publishing delays force editors to manage extra coordination and stress in delivering quality content on time.
4. **Emergencies happen:** A handful of somewhat common situations put particular pressure on editors who are responsible for delivering content to Veterans quickly.


# Key Quotes:

1. **Poor publishing UX**

Users rely on accumulated knowledge from their team and training, not the interface to understand what to expect when publishing content. 

*"I’m thinking it's going to publish right then - like Teamsite that we’re using currently." 
	— VAMC editor
  
*"The last I remember, it was going to take an 8 hour turnaround or maybe a day." 
	— VAMC editor
  
*"I was looking for it to update in 20 minutes or so, but it didn't. I felt like it took longer than 20 minutes."
	— VAMC editor

Although existing interface elements such as the “last updated” tooltip, green success banner, and the front end URL exist, they don’t cohere into useful information that tells users what to expect.

*"Va.gov url pending- not sure what that means.” 
	— Sitewide Content Editor
  
*“When I first looked at it, I thought the last updated tooltip was saying the page was updated, but I know that’s not what that’s saying. I think it’s really saying  that it’s been received in the system to update that page.”	— VAMC editor
  
2. ** **Faster = better(*):**

Most editors believed that quicker publishing would benefit their work as long as it could handle complexities

*"Quicker publishing would make it significantly less stressful... It would save me time knowing it's done and out there." 
	— VAMC Editor
  
*“Publishing cross-linked content causes particular stress because I have to make sure I get this right because I don’t know what’s going to happen.”
	 —Sitewide Content editor
   
3. **Delay = inefficiency + stress:**

Currently editors have to remember to go back and check their content before they can consider it "done," which burdens their workflow and process.

*"Live is really what tells me what’s true, not the cms." 
	— Sitewide Content team member
  
*"It would be great to just be like, 'boom, I got that done' and then not have to worry about it." 
	— Sitewide Content team
  
People with both high and low levels of organizational authority faced external pressure to turn around content quickly from bosses and stakeholders. Many stakeholders assume instant publishing is possible, and editors must manage expectations. 

*"There was a policy change. It was only one line of text but, you know, we got a 'please change this right now,'  message from our stakeholders."
	 — Sitewide content editor
   
*"My boss was going back and looking for the requested change in an hour or a few hours. I didn’t want to have to explain the delay to them." 
	— VAMC editor

Editors with the most need to turn around time-sensitive content quickly have the ability to release content manually. Although it often meets their needs, it requires extra coordination with their own team and CMS team to be successful, especially for weekend releases.

*“We must coordinate with the CMS support and platform teams to ensure there is someone available to support the publishing process in case the manual content release fails.” — Sitewide Content team editor

4. **Emergencies happen:**

The kinds of situations that require a tight turnaround include: changing emergency conditions such as COVID, reverting to correct serious content errors, and sudden policy changes impacting Veterans. 

*"We need to be able to turn around content in under an hour all the time. This year, that has been sometimes multiple times a day, particularly around the COVID content." — Sitewide Content team

*“In cases where someone accidentally publishes content that wasn't ready to go out the team needs to be able to revert quickly to avoid having wrong information up on VA.gov.” — Sitewide Content team

## Discussion

### Additional Insights

* Very few editors needed weekend publishing, and the ones that did said it comes up just a handful of times a year.
* Editors reported scheduled publishing might be helpful in some circumstances, but could further complicate workflows that involve multiple teams.

### Recommendations

**1. Provide system feedback:** Implement interface changes that help editors understand what to expect from publishing. This will benefit editorial experience for both the current publishing process as well as AP.
**2. Ensure usability to avoid disaster:** Test to make sure users can successfully navigate the new publishing reality to avoid confusion and risks to content.
**3. Prioritize content types with the most turnaround pressures, such as:**

* Benefits detail pages
* Events
* News Releases
