#### Main Process - interview recordings, transcripts and data analysis:

1. VA Employee/Contractor user interviews potentially containing PII recorded on local Zoom recording to encrypted A6/CA laptop
2. Transcription to local file on encrypted A6/CA laptop
3. PII removed and names swapped for anonymous unique ID’s**
4. Scrubbed transcription file uploaded to online cloud tool for analysis
5. Data in online cloud tool will be isolated to data that A6/CA collects. No external data source will be integrated
6. Scrubbed transcription file and synthesis ultimately uploaded to VA Github Repo for storage and reference
7. Local transcription file on A6/CA laptop securely destroyed

** file with anonymous unique ID’s saved locally on encrypted A6/CA Laptop
