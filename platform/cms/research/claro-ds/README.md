# Research Plan for VFS-CMS, November 2020

## Goals
This research plan is for the VFS-CMS - VFS-CMS team.

The VFS-CMS is VA.gov's content management system that provides the structured content templates, workflows and governance that help various teams at VA serve veterans accurate, accessible, up-to-date content.

Our objective for this research is to **gather first impressions about the Claro Admin UI and identify opportunities to mitigate impacts during the transition from the current Drupal design system to Claro Admin UI**. 

#### Solution Hypothesis
* ...

#### Research Questions
* ...

#### What knowledge will make us feel like the research process has been successful?
Developing an uderstanding of how Claro Admin UI impacts people's experiences in the CMS will show our research process has been successful. In particular, identifying visual adjustments that would ease the transition to Claro.

## Method	

**What method of research are you planning?**
20-minute remote _Thinking Aloud Test_ in a demi environment with Claro Admin UI installed, followed by the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) and follow-up questions.

This session will not be recorded. We'll use verbatim notes to register the session, followed by synthesized notes on our observations.

**Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?**
The _Thinking Aloud Test_ was chosen because we're interested in users' thoughts and reactions as they move through the user interface. The _Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire_ is used to measure users' perceived satisfaction (usefulness, information quality, and interface quality) of a system at the end of a usability study.

**Where are you planning to do your research?**
Online, via Zoom. Remote observers and note takers will be in attendance.

**What will you be testing?**
Demo environment with Claro Admin UI installed.
