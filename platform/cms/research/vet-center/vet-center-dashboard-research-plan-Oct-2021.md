# Research Plan for Vet Center Dashboard Usability Study
## Background
We designed and implemented a dashboard for Vet Centers in Q1 2021.

The design intent was to...
- Provide access to everything a Vet Center editor might need to do in one place.
- Help Vet Center editors orient to their top tasks through cards that use icons and descriptions.
- Bridge the gap between the content model and users' mental model through action links in cards that jump link to relevant parts of a form.
- Allow editors to review satellite locations and their operating statuses at a glance so they can see what might need updating.
 
## OCTO-DE Objectives

This study supports OCTO-DE object three, “increase the quality and reliability of VA services,” by making it easier for editors of Vet Center content to use the Drupal content management system. 

When editors can more easily find and edit their content, they are less likely to make errors, and more likely to follow Veteran-centered content guidelines, thus increasing the quality of information Veterans access on VA.gov. 
 
 
## Research Goals

Our goal is to understand whether our design hypothesis for the Vet Centers dashboard is valid. If it is...

- We can bridge the gap between users' mental model and the content model by jump linking from cards to forms
- Icons (in cards) help users recognize the piece of content they need to edit
- Surfacing satellite locations and their operating status prompts users to make necessary adjustments

## Outcome
As a result of this research, we will
- Build a backlog for a potential future iteration of the Vet Centers dashboard
- Identify design hypothesis and patterns that may help us design the VA Medical Center product dashboard.

## Research questions

**Top Tasks**

- Does orienting editors with “top tasks” align with how they actually work?

    - Do the top tasks reflect the work they need to do? 
    -  If not, how do they do their work? 
    - Are there common tasks that are missing? 
    - Are there tasks that are unused?

**UI/workflow**
- Do the editors have an accurate understanding of how the content model works? 
    - Do they feel oriented within the form (because the dashboard takes you to the middle of the form)? 
- Do the cards help editors understand where their content will end up on the website? 
    - Do the icons (in cards) help users recognize the piece of content they need to edit?
    - Do the icons make sense?
    - Does the UI in the dashboard help people get where they need to be?  
    
** Operating Status **  
- Is the satellite location operating status dashboard useful?
    - Does it help users make necessary adjustments for their operating status?
    - If not, what is the form missing?
 
## Hypothesis
- The dashboard covers editor’s main tasks 
- The dashboard makes it easier for editors to do their work, but may not account for all workflows
- The dashboard helps bridge the gap between editor’s mental model of the website and the content model
- The Vet Center dashboard is a useful model for organizing editor workflow for other products. 

## Method
Usability testing with some semi-structured interviews questions
 
## Location
Remote, via Zoom

## Participants 
5-7 Vet Center site editors who:
- Were not involved in the initial MVP user study
- Are already familiar with working in the CMS (both experienced and new users)
- Work on a Vet Center site that has recently launched (not from the initial 10 centers)
