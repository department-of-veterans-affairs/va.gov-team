##Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the dashboard you use to update your Vet Center content. 
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. 
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to make it easier for site editors to update their content. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. 
- You'll be interacting with the content management system in a training environment, so the content on your site may appear out of date. Don’t worry about that! None  of your actions today will affect your actual VA website. 
- We can stop the session at any time. If you want to stop, just let me know.  
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete the analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
	- If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more. 


Start recording.


## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes


Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
	- How long have you worked at the VA? 
	- What do you enjoy most about your job? 
	- When Veterans contact you, what are they typically looking for? 
	- How long have you been a site editor for your Vet Center? 
	- How often do you update content on your website? 
	- How long does that usually take you? 
		- What kind of tasks do you most often do on the site?  
## Log in
Now, I have a few activities that I'd like you to do in the CMS. While you do them, please think aloud and vocalize your thoughts and decisions. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn.

	- I’m going to drop the link to the training site into Zoom Chat. [add URL: https://cms-t0929xzey63anhwln3clysmzmpppiwvz.demo.cms.va.gov/ 
	- For this activity, you’ll log in the same way you did during your editor training.  
	- Add your email address as the username, and use the password “drupal8”. I’ve also added that password in the zoom chat if you prefer to copy and paste. 


 
## First Task: Dashboard Cards - X minutes
	- Can you talk through what you’re seeing here?  
	    - What do you notice first? 
	    - What kinds of things can you do here? 
	    - Is there anything you usually need to do that you don’t see represented here? 
	    - Does anything you see here stand out as confusing, or you have questions about? 
## Second task: Featured content - 5 minutes
Now I’ll ask you to do a task here. As a reminder, this is the training environment, so don’t worry -- changes you make here won’t show up on VA.gov.

	- Let’s say you are offering a new program at your Vet Center, and you want to highlight it on your site. How would go about doing that? 
	    - [Assume participant clicks on the card] 
	    - How confident are you that you’re in the right spot to add your content? Very? Sorta? Not confident? 
	    - Any other thoughts about where you are or what you see here? 
	- Okay, great, now let’s go back to the main dashboard.  
	- Wait and see what they do to get there] 
 
### Things to watch for:
	- How are they thinking about the dashboard?  
	- When they use the jump links, do they seem oriented within the form?  
	- How do they get back to the dashboard when they’re done? 
## Third task: Add a service - User Interface and Workflow - 10 minutes
	- Say your Vet Center is offering a new service for veterans. How would you go about drafting this new content?  
	    - [Once they’ve gotten to the service description field] You can just write test for this activity. 
	    - Go ahead and save the changes you just made.  
		- You can just leave it as a draft for now.  
		- [If they ask] For the revision log, you can just write test.   
	- Now that you’ve saved a change, how would you go about checking your work? 	 
	- If they say no - have you ever tried to check your work? What happened? 
	- [May need to reprompt once they get to the dashboard again] 
 
### Things to watch for:
	- Does the workflow go smoothly? 
	- Do they seem oriented within the form?  
	- Do they want to preview the updated text to make sure it is saved? 
	- If they do preview their text, how do they get back to the dashboard? 
## Fourth Task: Operating Status - X minutes
	- Now that you’ve added a new service, you’re on to the next task.    
	- Here’s the scenario: The zombie apocalypse has happened and you’ve closed your Vet Center. From here, how would you go about updating information on your site so Veterans are aware? 
	- [If they go to operating status first]  
	    - Tell me about what you see here? 
	    - Can you tell me about what this is and how you use it / how do you understand it? 
	    - [Maybe some followup questions to understand hours vs. operating status?] 
	- [If they don’t touch the hours]: Is there anything else you need to update?  
	    - How about your listed hours?    
### Things to watch for:
	- Do they return to the dashboard? If so, how do they get there?  
	- Do they use/notice the operating status at the bottom of the dashboard? 
## Fifth Task: Satellite location - X minutes
	- Generally, how do you quickly check whether your operating status is accurate?  
	    - How have you communicated about closures or hours in the past? How often  
	- Can you tell us about what you’re seeing here? 
	- What would you expect to be able to do here? 
	- [If they have a mobile vet center] - How often do you expect to update information about this? 
	- Can you show us how you would do that? 
### Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
- If you could wave a magic wand and change anything about this page, what would you do?  
- Do you have any ideas or feedback about the cms/the website we might want to consider? 
- Is there anything else you’d like to share before we wrap up?  
- Any questions for me? 
- Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. 
 
## Back pocket questions
- Why do you think these cards are in this order? If you could reorder the cards, what order would make the most sense to you?
