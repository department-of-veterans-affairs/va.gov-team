# Research Plan for VBA MVP Public Contact Staff Discovery
## Background
Between 5 and 7 VBA Regional Office (RO) facilities will be involved in the launch of the [Minimal Viable Product (MVP) for publishing VBA facility information](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vagov-cms-team-5c0e7b864b5806bc2bfc2087/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/10191) in Drupal starting in late 2022/early 2023.

The MVP will give the designated CMS editors a basic set of functionality to publish information about their facility operations on VA.gov so Veterans can successfully plan their next visit and perform other key tasks.

While some of this functionality has been developed and tested with other VA editors and Veterans, the MVP seeks to uncover any situations unique to VBA facilities that may require new research, change management planning, product development, and user testing before, during, and after the full roll-out to all VBA facilities starting in [2023](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vagov-cms-team-5c0e7b864b5806bc2bfc2087/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/10185).
 
## OCTO objectives
### North Star
* Increase the quality and reliability of VA services 

### Goal
* Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information 

### Numbers
* Increase usage of digital, self- service tools
* Decrease call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

## Research goals
The primary goals of this research are to understand from the perspectives of the Public Contact staff for that facility the:
* Service delivery model for the facility or group of facilities for a geographic area.
* Context for: 
  * Event- and staff-related information
  * Situational updates related to a facility

This research will follow or run partially in parallel to a [related effort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/regional-offices/research/2022-8-veteran-facing/research-plan.md) to understand the needs of Veterans when visiting a VBA facility and getting services. 

## Outcomes
The results of this research will be used to develop recommendations for OCTO-DE to inform a future direction for:
* Development of the VBA facility product
* The change management strategy and plan for the MVP and the full rollout of the CMS to all VBA facilities
* The training plan for the MVP and the full rollout
* Future research for the VBA project

## Hypothesis
* This research will surface complexities and nuances in how different VBA facilities deliver their services to Veterans that should inform the design of the VBA facilities product.

## Research Questions
* What are the common things Veterans ask for and how do they ask for them?
* When do Veterans ask for a benefit by phone vs. in person and typically why?
* What do Veterans typically try to accomplish during an in-person facility visit?
* What are the situations when Veterans don't feel successful getting a benefit at the facility and why?
* What do you wish Veterans knew before visiting this location?
* What happens when a Veteran visits the facility for a service you don’t offer?
* What do Veterans need to know or do to be adequately prepared for a visit?
* What are the unique characteristics of the benefits offered by that facility?
* Can Veterans access any/all of your services anywhere else in the area, such as a Vet Center?
* How are the available services handled by the Public Contact team?
* How are Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) located at that facility important and why?
* When should some benefits be encouraged or promoted to be done online or a phone call?
* Does the Public Contact staff handle any aspect of the facility's website?
  
## Method

## Location
* Remote, via Zoom
