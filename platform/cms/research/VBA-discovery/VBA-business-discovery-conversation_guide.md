# Conversation Guide for VBA MVP Editor-facing (business) Discovery – August 2022

This conversation guide includes separate questions for 2 VBA roles involved in the business, or editor-facing, research:
* Facility staff (can be called Public Contact staff)
* VBA staff who were previous web editors or new staff who will be editing content in Drupal CMS

## Moderator logistics
Prep a sharing window with:
* VBA facility’s home page

Mute your Slack notifications

Turn off phone ringer

Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.

Prepare to frame the question differently if the person is entirely new to the web role.

## Intro (all roles, 5 minutes)
*Allow 2 minutes for any tech issues.*

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. We really appreciate you taking the time to talk with us! 

Today we're going to talk about your facility’s operations and your process for making facility information available to Veterans on your website.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
* This entire session should take 30 minutes or less. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. Our goal is to improve these tools to better meet the needs of site editors and of Veterans. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. 
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. When we present the results of this research, none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
*Start recording.*
* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
