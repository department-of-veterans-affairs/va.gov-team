# CMS Editor Qualitative Research Meta-analysis
Joann Agnitti, VFS-CMS, 4/11/2023
## Background and objectives
Editors are essential to the livelihood of the Drupal CMS, as they are responsible for creating, editing, and publishing content. The user experience of editors is therefore crucial to the success of the CMS. However, the UX of CMS editors can often be frustrating or lacking, leading to decreased productivity and user satisfaction. 

The objective of this qualitative meta-analysis is to identify and synthesize key findings from existing research on the UX of editors in the Drupal CMS. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of our past research, and to identify common pain points and challenges faced by editors. Additionally, we aim to provide recommendations for design and development that might improve the UX of Drupal CMS editors. 

## Scope and methodology
**Scope**

This meta-analysis focuses on research studies that explore the UX of editors in our Drupal CMS. The scope of this analysis includes studies that were conducted between 2020-2022. 

**Methodology**

Our existing research studies were systematically reviewed and analyzed using thematic synthesis, a method of qualitative data analysis that involves identifying and grouping themes across studies. The analysis process involved multiple stages of categorization and synthesis to identify common themes and patterns in the data. The extracted data were analyzed and presented as a summary of UX themes and recommendations.

## UX themes and recommendations
_Note: Since these insights were all pulled from research that spanned from 2020-2022, some of the UX recommendations may have already been discussed and even implemented as of the date of this report._

### Theme 1: Change management
1. Some editors appreciate the look and feel of the Drupal CMS compared to the older Teamsite CMS while others are not fully on board. [^1]
   - Of those who appreciate the new CMS, they like that the streamlined approach focuses on “what vets want to know, not what the VA wants to tell them” and thus contains “less fluff.” For those who aren’t convinced, they feel the CMS feels unfinished and too restrictive in that it won’t allow them to embed video, doesn’t allow for responsive images, they can’t edit the left navigation, and they can’t manage folders and directories. 
2. Editors want to be in the loop regarding changes to their workflow. [^2]
    - During the VAMC upgrade of 2021, editors reported feeling left out of the process. They felt there was a lack of transparency, and that decisions were made at a high level and they weren’t asked to be involved. At the same time, they expressed an interest in being a part of making things better for the future. 
3. Learning and adjusting to a new environment.[^3]
    - In rolling out the Drupal CMS, editors who previously worked on the Teamsite CMS reported having to get used to the changes. In particular, they had to adjust to new publishing times and organizational flow.
4. Editors are invested in catering to the needs of veterans, but may be defaulting to previous methods without considering context. [^4]  
    - Editors have expressed wanting support for uploading PDFs so that vets can download event flyers (akin to how they would view the event on a physical bulletin board in a facility). While flyers may be an acceptable way to communicate to vets when they are in a facility, they are not conducive to a digital environment as they can be difficult to read, rely on veterans downloading the information in order to consume it, and are not accessible. 

#### Recommendations
1. Compare what editors want in terms of CMS functionality to what users of their websites need and expect. Are there discrepancies? Is there something vets and their families look for from the website that isn’t there, that could be solved with added functionality within the CMS? 
2. Continue to find ways to solicit editors for their ongoing feedback on the current status of the CMS as well as engage them in planning for the future of the CMS. Solidifying their early buy-in will make eventual roll out processes smoother and more enjoyable for everyone involved. 
3. Consider the change management process for any future CMS upgrade projects (where you are taking a legacy instance and upgrading to Drupal). Help editors adjust by anticipating their concerns and questions and highlighting the differences and/or similarities among the different environments so they can prepare themselves for changes in workflow and content creation practices and transition as smoothly as possible. 
4. Consider ways in which to help editors translate the contents of a PDF into a more digital-friendly format, and explain the rationale behind the decision to not allow PDFs. 

### Theme 2: Editor multidimensionality
5. An editor is not just an editor: Vet Center editors greatly value the outreach component of their work. Some editors have reported not having a regular cadence of logging into the CMS, partly due to not considering updating the website to be a primary responsibility. [^2][^4] [^5] [^7]
    - Consequently, editors express a difficulty establishing a connection with vets through the CMS. They value the featured content section because it allows them some freedom to reflect local offerings, such as events. However, they feel the character limit for this section is too restrictive and prevents them from providing adequate info about special programs to Veterans. Editors want better functionality for promoting events.

#### Recommendations
5. Consider how the CMS could better support editors as a means of outreach to veterans. 
    - Editors, of Vet Centers especially, view outreach as not only a major part of their job responsibilities, but their favorite part of it. If the CMS is positioned as a mechanism for outreach, it may influence how editors value it and thus encourage them to engage with it on a more regular basis to make edits and updates to website content. 
    - Consider increasing the character limit of the events section so that editors feel less restricted in their abilities to engage and connect with veterans via the website to promote events. 

### Theme 3: Support
6. Multiple preferences for on-the-job learning.[^2] [^6]
    - Editors report having preferences for both guided learning opportunities (e.g., attending helpdesk training sessions, writing an email to support) and active/independent learning practices (e.g., learning by doing, referencing Knowledge Base articles, reading inline guidance).
7. Preparation and readiness to work in the CMS.[^1] [^2]
    - Editors’ confidence in using the Drupal CMS seems somewhat tied to the timing of the training they receive. There is also the issue of rolling out new features while editors are still learning the older features, creating a situation where they feel they can’t keep up. 
8. Confusion surrounds the governance processes of the CMS. [^8]
    - It is not clear to users how to ask for new CMS accounts or for CMS permissions. There seems to be “many ways” to do both, and users aren’t sure which is the best or recommended way. 

#### Recommendations
6. Continue to provide a variety of learning opportunities to support editors in their quest for knowledge. To keep in mind:
    - Keep KB articles up to date and timestamp them with the last edit so editors know the content is accurate and trustworthy. 
    - Continue to provide inline guidance (like tooltips and helpful placeholder text) to anticipate and answer editors’ questions in the moment they need it. 
    - Consider other ways in which we might help editors grow progressively more confident handling more complicated tasks in the system. 
7. Consider the preparation needs of new editors, or people to whom working in a Drupal CMS is a new experience. 
    - Timing of trainings is a friction point. Too early, or too soon before editors have access to Drupal, and they question the usefulness. Too late, and they feel ill-equipped to handle CMS-related responsibilities. 
8. Clarify and simplify the processes for requesting CMS permissions and accounts. 
    - Minimize the amount of confusion editors feel by documenting and socializing the CMS policies of access and permissions. 

### Theme 4: Content creation and publishing
9. Content does not display as expected within the preview. [^8]
    - Editors are confused when content doesn’t show up in the way they expected, which makes them uncertain about how preview mode works. 
10. Friction around adding images. [^4]
    - Editors report the process for uploading images to be confusing and lacking. They want more flexibility with adding images to text areas as well as adding captions to images. They are also displeased with how the cropping feature works as it isn’t in line with how they expect it to work. 
11. Friction around the timing of publishing. [^8] [^10]
    - Editors aren’t sure when their published content will go live— they’ll check the website in order to know for sure (they don’t trust the CMS to tell them the truth). Sometimes delays in publishing cause stress and require extra coordination on editors’ parts. If checking the website for published content, for example, they have to remember to return to that task hours later. It adds an extra step for them. 
12. Interface is not conducive to complex editing. [^1]
    - Editors can’t resize their windows for side-by-side editing. The field of display also adds friction in that a content block requires fields outside of a work area that you can’t see without scrolling. Editors don’t realize anything is wrong until they get a publishing error. 

#### Recommendations
9. Create more education around the decoupled nature of edit mode and preview mode. Editors still seem to not understand why preview mode does not work as they expect and are used to. Consider possibly renaming from “preview” mode to something more descriptive of the connected action. “View as published” maybe?
10. Explore the process of uploading images to the CMS
    - Identify the pain points and workarounds editors have come up with. Where are the inefficiencies and areas of opportunity? 
11. Reignite the explorations into the accelerated publishing initiative to address concerns regarding publishing inefficiencies. 
12. Make sure content fields are responsive to screen size; make required fields obvious and easy to see to prevent surprise errors.

### Theme 5: Collaboration
13. Editors communicate with each other about the status of content. [^8] [^9]
    - As part of the content creation/editing process, editors need a way to communicate with each other about content status transitions.
14. Editorial workflows are not clear and consistent. [^8] [^9]
    - There is no consistent approach to describing the editorial workflow state and history between dashboards, content view screens, and content edit screens.

#### Recommendations
13. Strengthen collaborative capabilities.
    - Examine the current collaboration capabilities offered within the CMS and explore if they are serving editors’ needs (e.g., content assignment, notifications, content states).
14. Create a clearer distinction between content states so that editors and content creators can track the progress of their content (i.e. draft, pending review, in review, approved, published, archived, deleted, etc.).

### Theme 6: Content architecture
15. Navigating to pages within the CMS can be difficult. [^1] [^3]
    - The process of finding a page can feel like a maze. Some editors create workarounds such as bookmarking key pages or using filters to parse through the different levels to find the right content.
    - It is clunky and circuitous for editors to get to the page they’re trying to edit. Then, when they find the page, they have to find the right block. It’s “silly and cumbersome” according to one editor. 
16. Some editors object to the naming conventions used within the CMS. [^1] [^8]
    - There seems to be a misalignment with the way pages are labeled in the CMS and the natural language editors use when describing certain pages. One editor noted that “Some of the names sound like they came from a drunk yoda.”

#### Recommendations
15. Explore the reasons editors have difficulty navigating to pages within the CMS. This may involve usability testing, tree testing, and creating a sitemap to understand how content is currently organized to help us identify pain points. 
16. Utilize an information architecture study (like a card sort or tree test activity) to explore how to create a more suitable alignment between the natural language editors use to describe pages within the CMS and the naming conventions currently in place. 

### Theme 7: Accessibility
There is a lot of room for alt text improvements. [^6]
    - The biggest area of opportunity for improvement is in the accuracy and equivalency of alt text descriptions. During an alt text audit, it was found that a high number of audited items simply used the filename instead of alt text.

#### Recommendation
17. Consider ways to assist editors in creating equivalent and accurate alt text such as automated help text for facility photos or staff profile pictures, which represented over half of items audited.

### Theme 8: Editor impact
18. Editors want to see the impact of their work. [^5]
    - Editors want reassurance that the work they are doing for the website has an impact on the veteran experience. 

#### Recommendation
18. Consider adding a usage/analytics dashboard so that editors can see view counts and other impact metrics, like time spent on page, scroll depth, click-through rates, and heatmaps, to give their work more meaning.  

## Implications for future research
1. Further define and map the different needs, expectations, and responsibilities between Vet Center and VAMC editors to gain a deeper understanding of these segments. 
2. Confusion around page navigation and naming conventions points to a possible fundamental misunderstanding of editors' mental models around these structures. An information architecture study (or a series of IA studies) could help us understand this to a greater degree and come up with a more intuitive structure. 
3. Explore the effectiveness of the CMS in supporting editorial workflows. How well does the CMS do this now, and where does the system fall short? What are the collaborative functionality needs of editors? 
4. Explore the idea of creating an analytics dashboard for editors: what metrics would be most meaningful to capture? What impact would access to these metrics have on how editors view their work with the CMS? 
5. Reignite explorations into the accelerated publishing initiative to address concerns regarding publishing inefficiencies.
