## Start here

- VA/OCTO maintains an [editor recruitment database](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/CMSTeam/Shared%20Documents/General/UX%20Research/Editor_Recruitment/_Editor_Research_Participants.xlsx?d=w13624831832c49c8b59a82d73fa837a4&csf=1&web=1&e=8TUP9J) in the CMS Team Sharepoint > UX Research folder. Research ethics and VA policies require us to provide access to only those as needed.  
- After your [editor research plan (template)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/cms/research/sitewide-cms-editor-research-plan-template.md) is ready, work with your VA UX lead for temporary access to the database 
- You will create a separate participant spreadsheet specific to your study and it MUST be stored in Sharepoint. 
- When your study is complete, update the main database with any new information and especially the research study name and date of editor participation. 
- After main database is updated, delete the study specific participant tracker 
- At times, you will come across additional participants potentially referred by other editors or through listening sessions, after you obtain consent for their participation you can add them to the main database.

## CMS research studies

This lists all formal research with CMS users. Feature-specific research should reside in the cross-disciplinary directory (such as [Editorial Workflow and Assignments](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/cms/content-ops/editorial-workflow/assignments/)), but should be linked to from here.
