    1. VAMC editors are the most frequent users across all levels, followed by Outreach editors
    2. Vet Center editors are more likely to use it less frequently, thus reflecting their survey engagement
        1. 30% (24/78) of editors utilize Drupal-CMS at least one time per month
        2. 25% (20/78) of editors currently use Drupal-CMS at least one time per week

    1. Almost 50% lack confidence, indicating a need for further discovery
        1. VAMC editors are split 50/50 with half feeling “very” confident and half feeling “somewhat”
        2. Nearly 90% of Vet Center editors feel “somewhat” confident

    1. VAMC and Outreach groups lead positive sentiment
    2. Vet Center editors are split 50/50, with half falling into the “neither” category

### Insights
1. Editors are expressing a desire for enhanced capabilities in content creation. Specifically, they are requesting additional features related to photos, including the ability to add more images than currently allowed. 
2. Editors are demonstrating a divergence in their understanding of the purpose of the Drupal-CMS system, with many comments requesting more customization and flexibility within templates. We believe that editors may not fully comprehend the intentional consistency of all Drupal-CMS products for all site visitors. Providing transparency into this intentionality is crucial. 
3. Editors are understanding of the Help Desk's scope of support and are empathetic towards their limitations. They acknowledge that the Help Desk provides timely responses and is perceived as helpful, efficient, and supportive.

### Next Steps
1. Determine the items we can action right away without further research
2. Continue to distrubute findings and insights to product teams and stakeholders
4. Collaborate to determine the timeline for the next survey; modify question set as needed
6. Re-distribute to editors for continuous learning
7. Find ways to share findings/action taken with editors to promote a healthy feedback loop
