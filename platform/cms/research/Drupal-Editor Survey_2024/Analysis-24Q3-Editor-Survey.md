### Top-3 Qualitative Findings
1. Editors are expressing a desire for enhanced capabilities in content creation. Specifically, they are requesting additional features related to photos, including the ability to add more images than currently allowed. 
2. Editors are demonstrating a divergence in their understanding of the purpose of the Drupal-CMS system, with many comments requesting more customization and flexibility within templates. We believe that editors may not fully comprehend the intentional consistency of all Drupal-CMS products for all site visitors. Providing transparency into this intentionality is crucial. 
3. Editors are understanding of the Help Desk's scope of support and are empathetic towards their limitations. They acknowledge that the Help Desk provides timely responses and is perceived as helpful, efficient, and supportive.

### Background Information
----------------------

#### **Question:**  
How long have you been in your current position?

|           | < 1yr  | 1-3 yrs | > 3 yrs |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------|
| CY2024 Q3 | 32     | 32      | 15      |
|           | 40.51% | 40.51%  | 18.99%  |

The data shows a 50/50 split, with the majority of editors falling into two periods: Less than 1 year and One to three years. This data provides us with insights into the editor comfort level within Drupal-CMS. It suggests that the majority of editors are relatively new to the system. We believe that editors who have been working in the system for a longer period may have a higher level of confidence in using Drupal-CMS.

* * *

#### **Question:**  
What percentage of your current position is writing and managing web content?  
(0% = none at all and 100% the main function of your job)


|           | 0%    | 10%    | 20%    | 30%    | 40-70% | 80-100% |
|-----------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| CY2024 Q3 | 7     | 23     | 11     | 12     | 15     | 11      |
|           | 8.86% | 29.11% | 13.92% | 15.19% | 18.99% | 13.92%  |

Nearly half of all editors' current responsibilities involve writing and managing web content.

This data indicates that our editors are not only tasked with maintaining current and relevant content on a regular basis, but also with creating their section’s accessible content.

* * *

#### **Question:**  
How often do you use the CMS?

| CY2024 Q3 | 17     | 20      | 24       | 13         | 4     |
|           | 21.79% | 25.64%  | 30.77%   | 16.67%     | 5.13% |

This data gives us a view into the frequency of use by editors. Nearly twenty-two percent of editors utilize Drupal-CMS on a daily basis, while just over 30% of editors use the system once a month. Additionally, 25% of editors use Drupal-CMS once or more a month.

|           | Other             | 5  | 6.33%  |

This data provides insights into the response rate by product, with each product being defined as the ‘area the editor works in’. The VAMC editors had the highest response rate, with over 50%, while both Outreach and Vet Center editors had a response rate of 32%. It's important to note that editors were able to select as many products as applied, and we received a total of 115 responses to this question.

**💬 Notable Quotes:**

> _More flexibility in photo sizes for stories; quick publishing time._

> _There needs to be the ability to add more photos to feature stories. It would also be nice to embed videos. People rely on visual content in stories in todays world and having one photo is not adequate…_

A significant number of editors are expressing a desire for enhanced capabilities in content creation. Specifically, they are requesting additional features related to the process of selecting photos, including the ability to add more images than currently allowed. Another key area highlighted by the majority of feedback is the need to improve publishing speed. We acknowledge their challenges and are actively working to enhance the publishing workflow.

Editors are demonstrating a divergence in their understanding of the purpose of the Drupal-CMS system, with many comments requesting more customization and flexibility within templates. We believe that editors may not fully comprehend the intentional consistency of all Drupal-CMS products for all site visitors. Providing transparency into this intentionality is crucial.

> _I think it goes a good job of standardizing content across VA for Veterans who use multiple facilities._

**💬 Notable Quotes:**

> _Most of the things I have required assistance from the helpdesk for were in the knowledge base but were not named in such a way to intuit their purpose or did not use industry-standard keywords or even VA-specific ones that related to the solution/problem and did not display in the search results._

> _My experience with the help desk has always been great: they are patient, kind and very helpful indeed._

Editors are understanding of the Help Desk's scope of support and are empathetic towards their limitations. They acknowledge that the Help Desk provides timely responses and is perceived as helpful, efficient, and supportive. However, they suggest that there is room for improvement in the communication methods, particularly with regard to potentially disconnected email threads causing a lack of continuity.

**💬 Notable Quotes:**

> _I can never find what I'm looking for, so I end up having to contact the help desk._

> _Names of articles and jargon/key terms used within limit search result effectiveness. Many FAQ and related issue links create loops within the KB articles._

> _Oftentimes I find KB articles with outdated information or I can't find an article on what I'm looking for. Sometimes I can find something that's similar but it doesn't pertain to my sections so it's not really relevant. KB articles often seem more geared to VAMC editors than for those working in benefits or R&S._

> _Very helpful resource._

The feedback on the Knowledge Base is mixed, with some editors finding it helpful while others feel it does not live up to its advertised usefulness. Many editors struggle with the technical language used in the articles, making it difficult for them to understand the content. Additionally, editors express frustration with the navigation process when searching for articles, and they are looking for a more user-friendly approach to finding the information they need. Along with language and tone, editors are dissatisfied with the content, perceiving it to be outdated and unhelpful. Previous research suggests that editors prefer asking a colleague for help rather than using the Knowledge Base.

**💬 Notable Quotes:**

> _Make content publish faster. We were told a year ago there would be rolling content releases and that has not happened. It still takes 1-1/2 to 2 hours for something to publish. Try explaining that to your facility leadership over and over again. Also, the Drupal system is down frequently for whatever reasons. And, move the daily maintenance to sometime after normal working hours!_

> _Just a reminder to keep it a simple as possible. We can't afford to spend too much time on the website._

> _Replace it with something user friendly._

> _This web template is weak on what visual content, and amount of visual content, that can be published._

In the editors' final opportunity to provide feedback, their main concerns revolved around the speed of publishing content updates and their ability to preview content. They have also expressed a desire for simplified workflows and processes that do not necessitate additional training or learning to operate effectively. Editors are willing to share their feelings and suggestions, demonstrating a readiness to collaborate on improvements.
