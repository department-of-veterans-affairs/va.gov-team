# Editor Experience Research Study, Drupal CMS, 09/2025

## Background
The Editorial Experience Initiative is a Platform team effort to improve the tools, workflows, and support systems for the content Editors who use the Drupal CMS to publish and maintain VA.gov content. Editors play a critical role in ensuring Veterans and their families have timely, accurate, and accessible information. However, the efficiency and quality of their work is shaped by the broader context of their role, the efficiency of their workflows, the clarity of training, and the availability of reliable support resources.
This research will take a holistic look at Editors’ work, exploring their experience, both inside and outside of Drupal, to identify friction points, uncover unmet needs, and surface opportunities to improve their experience. By understanding the complete picture, we can make targeted improvements that reduce friction, increase efficiency, and improve Editor satisfaction.

Our specific areas of inquiry include:
- Overall Role and Work Context
- CMS Use and Pain Points
- Training, Onboarding, and Learning Preferences
- Support Resources and Materials

By grounding improvements in evidence from Editor experiences and feedback, this research supports OCTO objectives to deliver more efficient digital tools, improve internal user satisfaction, and ultimately enhance the speed and quality of Veteran-facing content delivery.

### OCTO Objectives 
This research supports the following OCTO-DE 2025 objectives:

Objective 2: OCTO’s platforms are the fastest, most efficient, and most secure way to deliver products at VA.
Streamlining onboarding and improving training will contribute to reduced error rates.
By understanding Editor workflow pain points, we will identify additional opportunities for valuable Generative AI tools.

Objective 3: OCTO teammates are empowered with the knowledge and resources they need to make a sustainable impact.

By understanding Editor motivations, learning styles, and workflow pain points, this work will inform the creation of training and support resources that improve CMS proficiency and confidence.
Streamlining onboarding, reducing time to proficiency, and enhancing supplemental materials will reduce friction and stress for Editors, contributing to sustained productivity and satisfaction.

Objective 4: OCTO positively influences VA’s ability to deliver software products and services faster, safer, and with higher quality.

Identifying gaps in Editor support resources and refining training approaches will improve Editorial efficiency and content quality.
This research will directly inform the development of impactful artifacts (e.g., guides, process documentation, onboarding resources, UX artifacts) that help internal CMS users deliver Veteran-facing content more quickly and accurately.

By addressing both the human and procedural aspects of the Editorial experience, this initiative advances OCTO’s goals of empowering internal users, improving platform efficiency, and ensuring high-quality outcomes for Veterans.


## Research Goals	
What are you trying to learn from this research? 

1. Understand the broader work context for Editors: Explore the full scope of Editors’ responsibilities, both inside and outside of Drupal, to understand how CMS work fits into their day-to-day priorities.
2. Identify CMS usage patterns and pain points: Learn about Editor understanding of Drupal and which Drupal tasks are most frequent, most time-consuming, or most challenging for Editors.
3. Assess training effectiveness and learning needs: Understand Editor motivations, learning styles, and preferences for training delivery. Identify opportunities to design onboarding and training experiences that are concise, memorable, and enable Editors to work confidently. Determine ways to accelerate onboarding and improve explanations of complex processes for new Editors.
4. Evaluate the quality and completeness of support resources: Understand how Editors currently use or supplement available resources; identify missing, outdated, or unclear support material; and discover changes that would make resources more useful for ongoing learning.

### Outcome
Findings from this study will provide a clear, evidence-based understanding of Editors’ roles, workflows, pain points, and learning needs. This insight will guide the Platform team in designing targeted improvements to the Drupal CMS experience, including:
- Streamlined workflows that reduce friction in high-frequency or high-difficulty tasks.
- Optimized onboarding and training that effectively explains essential tasks to Editors and enables them to work confidently and efficiently
- Enhanced support resources that are easy to find, relevant, and effective in resolving common challenges.

By grounding design decisions in actual Editor experiences, this research will reduce the risk of building solutions that miss critical needs, ensure that enhancements are directly aligned with real-world usage, and accelerate the path to adoption.

The learnings will be used to:
- Improve the Editor experience for CMS interface and workflow improvements.
- Create and update training modules that align with Editor learning styles and establish strong fundamental Drupal skills.
- Identify and reinforce support resources for troubleshooting and collaboration.
- Inform our product roadmap for 2026 with new development goals and initiatives.

### Hypothesis

Central Hypothesis
If we align Drupal workflows, training, and support with the real context of Editors’ work (inside and outside the CMS), Editors will complete common tasks faster, with fewer errors, and greater confidence—reducing time-to-publish and support burden.

**Assumptions**
- Editors complete tasks on a frequent and recurring basis.
- Editors learn and retain information from working on the job and not from training.
- Editors do not continue to use training videos as a reference once they complete the assignments.
- Editors refer to each other or live sites for help more than documentation.
- Editors are motivated to complete tasks but not develop expertise.
- Editors want to change things on VA.gov that they cannot control or do not know how to change

**Hypotheses (for each research goal)**

1. Understand the broader work context for Editors: We believe Editors balance a wide range of responsibilities, with a significant portion of their time spent on non-CMS tasks that compete with their ability to work in Drupal. We expect to find that limited bandwidth, frequent context-switching, and varying levels of facility/system knowledge directly influence how quickly and confidently Editors complete CMS work.

2. Identify CMS usage patterns and pain points: We believe Editors regularly encounter friction with high-frequency tasks such as uploading images, creating 508 compliant content, and fixing broken links. We expect that these pain points increase rework, slow publishing, and contribute to frustration. We also anticipate that navigation elements not tailored to Editor permissions cause unnecessary delays, and that simple reminders or built-in cues (e.g., for using Preview) would help prevent errors.

3. Assess training effectiveness and learning needs: We believe Editors do not desire to become Drupal experts; instead, they desire sufficient training in common tasks – preferring short, scenario-based training that explains both the “how” and the “why” behind CMS processes to improve retention and confidence.  We expect to find that current onboarding does not fully prepare them to work independently, and that clearer prompts to use demo environments and Preview will make early publishing feel safer and more efficient.

4. Evaluate the quality and completeness of support resources: We believe Editors want support that is easy to access in the moment of need, with embedded guidance, examples, and intuitive search. We expect to find that existing resources are often missing, outdated, or hard to find. As a result Editors may seek the support by reaching out to others, referencing live sites, or troubleshooting through trial-and-error. We anticipate that improving the relevance, accessibility, and findability of support materials will increase first-try problem resolution and reduce reliance on ad hoc assistance.



## Method	

We will conduct semi-structured, one-on-one interviews with Editors to gather in-depth qualitative insights into their roles, workflows, CMS usage patterns, training experiences, and support resource needs. Semi-structured interviews allow for a consistent set of core questions across participants while providing flexibility to explore emerging topics in more detail based on individual responses.

To enrich the conversation and elicit more specific feedback, we will incorporate stimuli and probes, such as:
- Current Drupal CMS forms, to prompt reflections on workflows.
- Live pages on VA.gov
- Examples of existing support resources (e.g., knowledge base articles, training snippets) for discussion and critique.
- Scenario prompts related to onboarding, troubleshooting, editing, and publishing, to uncover decision-making processes and pain points.

### Why this method is appropriate

The goals of the study focus on understanding context, identifying pain points, and exploring preferences, outcomes that are best achieved through open-ended, qualitative discussion rather than rigid survey instruments.

The maturity of the design is exploratory: We are not evaluating a finalized prototype or release-ready feature, but investigating needs and opportunities that will inform future design and development.

Stimuli and probes help participants recall specific experiences and provide actionable detail, making findings more concrete for design translation.

### Location

Sessions will be conducted remotely using Microsoft Teams.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach

We will work with Laura Flannery and VA stakeholders, including Erika Washburn, Michelle Middaugh, Barbara Kuhn, and Beth Potts, to identify eligible participants for each target group. Once identified, VA stakeholders will put CMS team members in touch with eligible participants for scheduling. All Editor recruitment will follow OCTO guidelines and will be documented and managed in SharePoint per internal recruitment procedures.

### Recruitment criteria
We will recruit 9–15 Editors, with representation across three key groups to capture a diversity of workflows, content types, and organizational contexts:
3 Editors from Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) (including Outreach)
3 Editors from Vet Centers (including Outreach)
3 Editors from Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA)
3 Editors from Benefits Hub
3 Editors from Resources and Support


**Participant requirements**
- Current CMS users who regularly create, edit, or publish content in Drupal for VA.gov.
- At least 3 months of Drupal CMS experience to ensure familiarity with core tasks, while still capturing a range of proficiency levels.
- Mix of high-frequency users (daily or weekly) and low-frequency users (monthly or less) to reflect different usage patterns and training/support needs.
- Representation from different geographic locations and facility sizes to capture a variety of operational contexts.

**Desired variation**
- Experience level: newer Editors vs. experienced Editors.
- Primary content responsibilities (e.g., facility pages, news stories, benefits content, events).
- Comfort with and adherence to accessibility, plain language, and VA content standards.

**Exclusions**
- VISN Editors (too broad and not always Editors who work in Drupal frequently)
- Inactive Editors
