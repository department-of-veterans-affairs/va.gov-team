# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **[NAME]** and **[NOTETAKER NAME]** is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Teams waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about your experience using Drupal CMS. We will use your feedback to help us improve the Drupal experience for all users.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
  
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your relationship with me or the CMS team. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
  
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with additional observers during this session?**
   - <mark>**If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Teams.</mark>
   - **If yes:** Admit observers. Have everyone say hello to the participant and then go camera off.
  
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
   - **Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
   

   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

‚û°Ô∏è **Start recording.**

> [!TIP]
> After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

# Emergency Exit Strategy
Be Mindful of Participant
Be mindful of participant's behavior
If they appear to be distressed, take a moment to check in with them
Offer to bypass a question
Suggest taking a short break
If they continue to give signs of distress, offer an opportunity to gracefully exit the session.
Use a sample exit strategy
Thank them profusely for their time and feedback
Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.

Blame technology: I am so sorry, but I just learned that the [website/prototype/thing I wanted to test with you today] is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.

Assign a Backup Moderator in Advance

This is best to practice beforehand, but can work if there is an emergency with the moderator. Appoint another team member who will be on the call as the backup moderator. You can say ‚Äúfor the next part of this session [backup moderator name] will moderate.‚Äù They should be prepared to jump in if something happens to you or you are not comfortable to finish the session.
Researcher Strategies
Pause your research activity.
You could say ‚ÄúI need to take a few minutes to set up the next task‚Äù or ‚ÄúI need a short break, please give me a couple of minutes‚Äù

Contact Drupal CMS Product Leads and/or MO Delivery Lead to describe your experience. As you are able, be available to answer questions. If it‚Äôs best for you to end your participation in the session and you‚Äôve set it ahead of time, hand off the session to a backup moderator. e.g ‚Äúfor this next part, [researcher] will take over.‚Äù If it‚Äôs best to end the session, gracefully close the session with one of your practiced exit strategies. Let the participant know that the recruiting team will follow up with them. Inform the recruiting team (Sofia Kirkman or Jillian King) that the session has ended.

When the session has ended, take care of your mental and emotional health. Being made to feel unsafe or uncomfortable during research can be a traumatizing experience. Take time to pause and assess your own energy, emotional comfort, and capacity. Let your team know if you need any support. Consider a debrief with your team and/or the observers on the call as an opportunity to acknowledge this experience and consider how we can better support researchers and participants moving forward.
Sample exit strategies
We recommend you plan a graceful exit strategy that you will feel comfortable using during a session. Your goal is to simply wrap up the session without any further incident or escalation. It is important not to blame the participant, since it could increase any distress or trauma they are experiencing. If you are exiting for a reason on your side, it‚Äôs best not to share any personal details, as it may create additional stress for all. Examples of exit strategies that have worked include:

Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.

Blame technology: I am so sorry, but I just learned that the [website/prototype/thing I wanted to test with you today] is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.

Backup Moderator: This is best to practice beforehand, but can work if there is an emergency with the moderator. Appoint another team member who will be on the call as the backup moderator. You can say ‚Äúfor the next part of this session [backup moderator name] will moderate.‚Äù They should be prepared to jump in if something happens to you or you are not comfortable to finish the session.
