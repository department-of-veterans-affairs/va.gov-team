## Background
As part of our continuous support for CMS editors, we understand the importance of providing on-demand answers and easy access to information. Currently, the Knowledge Base serves as our primary self-service resource, enabling editors to readily access the answers and information necessary for their work. However, we have uncovered certain insights that suggest the current organizational structure within the Knowledge Base may be lacking in terms of efficiency and usability.

To address these concerns and further enhance the self-service experience for CMS editors, we are conducting an in-depth study to gain a deeper understanding of the information retrieval needs of our editors. We aim to translate these insights into a more intuitive information architecture and organizational structure within the Knowledge Base. Our objective is to better understand editors’ needs and expectations of the Knowledge Base so that we can design a self-service resource that seamlessly aligns with their goals, ensuring they can easily find the information they need for success.



## Research Goals
* Determine how the current content structure of the Knowledge Base aligns with editors’ needs and expectations.
* Understand how editors currently navigate and search for content within the Knowledge Base.
* Identify specific challenges, pain points, and frustrations editors encounter during their information retrieval processes.
* Explore editors’ preferences for the organization and categorization of content within the Knowledge Base.
* Gather insights to inform improvements in the findability, searchability, and overall organizational structure of the Knowledge Base.




## Research Questions

* What specific goals do editors have in mind when accessing the Knowledge Base?
   * How do those objectives influence their interactions with the system?
* How do editors currently navigate and search for content within the Knowledge Base?
   * What specific challenges do they encounter during this process?
* What are editors’ key needs and preferences when it comes to organizing and categorizing content within the Knowledge Base?
   * How do these align with the current structure?
* How do users naturally group and categorize information or topics within the Knowledge Base?
   * Are there recurring patterns or groupings that emerge from card sorting results?
   * What labels or terminology do users associate with specific content categories?



## Methodology 

We conducted 60-minute moderated research sessions via Zoom. Participants were asked about their information-seeking behavior and needs related to the Drupal CMS Knowledge Base. 

Participants engaged in a card sort activity, organizing a list of 40 Knowledge Base articles into meaningful groups and assigning titles to each group. 

Participants were then asked to navigate to the CMS Knowledge Base. Here, participants provided detailed feedback on organizational structure, identified missing or confusing elements, and shared their preferences for finding information regarding editing within the CMS. 



## Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Editors have differing levels of experience with the Knowledge Base.
   * **True.** 
   * Some editors engage more extensively with the Knowledge Base, benefiting from numerous opportunities to learn through hands-on editing tasks. In contrast, other editors interact with the CMS sporadically, perhaps as infrequently as once a month, displaying a concentrated set of skills related to editing within the CMS.  

2. Editors’ information retrieval skills may vary, with some being more adept at searching for and retrieving content than others.
   * **True.** 
   * Knowing the appropriate keywords for a search is a distinct skill. While some editors possess a more comprehensive understanding of Drupal vocabulary, others may not be as proficient. 

3. Editors’ comfort and familiarity with digital tools affects their ability to use the Knowledge Base effectively.
   * **More information needed.**


4. Editors’ workload impacts their engagement with the Knowledge Base (both their frequency of use and the depth of their interactions).
   * **True**
   * Due to the demands of their positions, editors navigate the Knowledge Base, find what they need and move on without exploration. To add to this, editors will seek the option they believe will connect them to their answer the quickest, so they may opt for a colleague over the Knowledge Base in some cases. 

5. Editors have specific goals (e.g., research, content creation, or problem solving) when accessing the Knowledge Base.
   * **Likely true.**
   * Participants found the error messaging clear and helpful. The familiarity of the proposed design made it easy to learn, as it didn’t differentiate too much from their current alt text creation experience. 
6. The types of content editors work with impacts their interaction with the Knowledge Base.
   * **Likely true.**
   * It was observed that editors with fewer editing responsibilities (e.g., updating only one section of a website) interacted with the Knowledge Base sparingly, if at all. Conversely, editors with multiple editing responsibilities (like building a page) are  more likely to use the Knowledge Base more often. 




## Key Findings

1. Editors have different levels of experience and comfort with the Drupal CMS, and some struggle with certain tasks.
   * Some editors are editing in the CMS infrequently, while others spend a substantial portion of their days in the CMS. Editing is just one part of their job, and not everyone feels confident in using the CMS. Some editors see updating websites as an extra task, and a few focus more on connecting with Veterans than on editing websites. Many editors find the process of putting content on the website confusing, and they often rely on guides to help them. 
2. Editors want more training for the CMS so they feel more prepared to handle their editing responsibilities. 
   * Editors face a steep learning curve with the CMS, and desire more training and support. The Knowledge Base is used as a quick reference rather than a learning tool, with time constraints limiting exploration. Editors are quick to leave the Knowledge Base once they find what they're looking for. Vet Center editors value their monthly calls, emphasizing the value of personal touch in making the learning process less intimidating. Some editors prefer direct interaction for quick turnaround, while others turn to the Knowledge Base. Awareness of CMS changes varies, with Slack channels presenting challenges due to how many compete for attention.
3. The Knowledge Base is easy to find but doesn’t make the best first impression.
   * Editors generally find the Knowledge Base logically placed, with some proactively bookmarking it. However, the overall design lacks warmth, with a lack of standout elements, excess white space, and feedback about the table of contents being inefficient. This suggests a need for improvements in design and usability.
4. Editors are not inclined to explore the Knowledge Base, and presentation plays a big part in that.
   * The presentation of sections on the Knowledge Base landing page lacks the ability to effectively capture editors' attention. Because everything is visually similar and highlighted sections are not perceived as relevant, editors do not feel drawn to any specific piece of information. This means the layout is not facilitating a clear pathway for editors to engage with the most pertinent content, hindering the Knowledge Base’s effectiveness in connecting editors to crucial information.
5. Editors prefer to search for information in the Knowledge Base.
   * Editors generally favor using the search function, with some not even realizing there are categories to explore under the search box. However, one editor relies heavily on the Vet Center topic landing page, questioning the purpose of using the search as they assume all of the relevant information for that topic can be found on this page. 
6. While the search function is commonly utilized, outcomes and opinions differ.
   * Editors' opinions on the search function differ, with some finding it effective and others critical. Common challenges include irrelevant results and difficulty selecting appropriate keywords, exemplified by one editor's struggle to sift through excess information and the need for additional keywords for precision, especially with frequently used terms. 
7. The Knowledge Base exhibits inconsistencies in both plain language and styling.
   * Improvements in language simplification, clearer labeling, and contextual help text are needed in the Knowledge Base. There's confusion around terms like "product guides," and variations in the use of "CMS." Additionally, formatting inconsistencies, such as spacing and capitalization style, were observed, indicating a need for standardization.


## Details of Findings 

**1. Editors have different levels of experience and comfort with the Drupal CMS, and some struggle with certain tasks.**
   * Editors range in their usage of the Drupal CMS
     * Among the editors we spoke to, their reported frequency ranged from once a month at the low end to 50-60% of a day at the high end. 
   * Editing is just one of the numerous responsibilities that editors handle, and there is a wide variation in Drupal proficiency levels among them.
     * Updating websites is perceived as “an extra duty” on top of their existing responsibilities.
     * Two Vet Center editors emphasized their strength in connecting with other Veterans rather than website editing skills. Additionally, one of these editors pointed out that becoming an outreach specialist does not have any degree requirements.
* Editors may find the website publishing process overwhelming due to a lack of familiarity.
  * Editors look to Knowledge Base articles (KBAs) to explain things clearly and make complicated processes easier to understand.
    > _[on learning how to perform an editing function]_ “It’s so daunting. It shouldn’t take me this long.” - P3

**2. Editors face learning challenges and want better training for using the CMS.**
   * Editors face a significant learning curve with the CMS and would appreciate additional training and learning materials to help them feel more proficient and confident. The current offerings don’t feel like enough. 

      > “I got a YouTube video and then a link for Drupal. […] I feel like I’ve had to teach myself.” - P3

      > “The learning curve could be better.” -P1
  
   * Notably, editors see the Knowledge Base more as a quick reference for important information than a place for training or learning. They primarily use it for quick reference to essential information.
      > _One editor lamented that they have no time to explore._ “Maybe if I was only a web manager, but with 4 or 5 responsibilities Drupal’s only [a fraction] of what I do.” _He went on,_  “Everyone’s learning on the fly.” -P1
   * For VC editors, the learning curve is straightened through monthly calls with Michelle Middaugh. 
      > _One Vet Center editor remarked of Michelle,_ “She makes it less scary. She makes it feel like people can ask questions.” 
   * Vet Center editors often find it confusing to determine where to seek answers, as they have their intranet, the CMS Knowledge Base, and the CMS Helpdesk at their disposal. The appropriate resource for specific questions is not always clear. 
   * Half of the editors we spoke to (3 out of 6) prefer seeking answers directly from a person; in fact, one editor exclusively follows this approach and has never consulted the Knowledge Base.
      * These editors appreciate the promptness of responses and the way the person breaks down explanations in simple language.
   * The remaining half prefers utilizing the Knowledge Base. One of these editors identifies as a 'self-directed learner.' They turn to a person for assistance, be it a colleague or the help desk, only when unable to find what they need in the Knowledge Base.
   * Half of the editors become aware of changes to the CMS only when they encounter them while working within the system. Two CAIA editors noted their awareness of a Slack channel that announces changes to the CMS, although they generally overlook additional Slack channels that are not directly relevant or deemed highly important.
      > “I know there’s a CMS Slack channel and I’m part of that, but there are a lot of Slack channels…” -P5

**3. The Knowledge Base is easy to find but doesn’t make the best first impression.**
   * Every editor successfully located the Knowledge Base and found its placement logical. Notably, two out of six editors had it bookmarked for quick access.
   * The initial impression is that it lacks immediate warmth and allure. There's a lack of standout elements, excess unused white space, and the table of contents appears to be an inefficient use of space.
      > “It’s not very inviting. I feel like I have to really dig.” -P3

      > “If you got rid of [the table of contents], you’d be able to see more on the screen without having to scroll, which would be very helpful.” -P5

**4. Presentation and organization play a vital role in facilitating editors' access to key information.**
   * The organization of Knowledge Base articles can be improved for better clarity.
      * Browsing the Knowledge Base for information is challenging and not necessarily a quick or easy process. One editor mentioned the need to navigate through multiple categories, essentially having to hunt for the information they were seeking. 
      * Another editor observed that the “how-to guides” section lacks any articles explicitly labeled as how-to guides, or at least none were readily identifiable.
  * Editors are in need of sections that immediately catch their attention, particularly if these sections are tailored to specific audiences or functions.
    * Due to everything appearing at the same level, editors aren't drawn to any specific section. In other words, the currently highlighted sections are not perceived as relevant and do not assist in connecting editors with essential information.
      > _As one editor put it,_ “these aren’t the articles or resources I’m looking for.” -P5
     * Editors naturally block out information they perceive as irrelevant so they can zero in on what they find important. One VC editor remarked on the VAMC-related articles with, “It’s beyond our purview.” Another VC editor plainly stated, “I don’t even care about them.” 

**5. Editors prefer to search for information in the Knowledge base.**
* The majority of editors (4 out of 6) prefer using the search function to find relevant articles.
   * 2 editors reported not even knowing that categories existed below the search box because the table of contents obscured them
* One editor navigates Knowledge Base articles through their topic landing page (in this case, Vet Centers). They believe that everything they need to know is on this page. To them, if it's not there, what's the point of using the search?

**6. While the search function is commonly utilized, outcomes and opinions differ.**
   * Opinions on the search function vary among editors, with some finding it mostly effective (two out of six) and others (two out of six) being more critical. Pain points include:
      * Search results are not always relevant
      * Difficulty in knowing which keywords to use.
         > _One editor said,_ “It works okay but sometimes it’ll give me tons of information that I have to sort through even more so I have to go back and add more keywords.” -P3
         * As an example, that editor noted that if you use a word that is often used in articles, like “content”, you will be inundated with results

**7. The Knowledge Base exhibits inconsistencies in both plain language and styling.**
   * The language throughout the Knowledge Base can be simplified for clearer and more plain communication.
      * The term “product guides” was particularly confusing. One editor thought this referred to Drupal’s product guides (Drupal being the product)
         > Another editor agreed, “Product’ is a funny word to use here. When I think about products in my work I think about tools or digitized forms, products that VA contractors are designing for the VA.gov ecosystem. So to see ‘product’ used in this sense, takes me a second. Because it’s ‘product’ within the CMS… I think?” -P5
     * Providing help text in specific sections will offer editors more context to determine if exploration would be worth their time. For instance, the label 'Get training' is too vague, leaving editors uncertain about what to expect upon clicking.
     * The term 'CMS' may not be universally understood. According to one editor, many VAMC editors commonly refer to the CMS as 'Drupal,' and its frontend is simply 'my VAMC website.' The term 'CMS' is not commonly used in their vernacular.

   * Inconsistencies in formatting were observed, with one editor noting variations in styling, including spacing and variations between title and sentence case.


## Additional Insights

**What we learned from the card sort activity**
   * Insights about prioritizing audience-specific, need-to-know information were supported by the outcomes of the card sort activity.
   * Each participant, when presented with the same articles, created the same three categories, among others: 1) VAMC- and VC-specific, 2) new-to-the-CMS, and 3) CMS basics.
   * The naming of categories and Knowledge Base article titles is crucial, providing editors with immediate insight into the content and its relevance to their needs.
   * The number of items featured per category holds significance. If there are too few (2 or less), editors question the category's purpose, and if there are too many (6+), they wonder why it's not broken down further to reduce cognitive overload.
   * Editors are comfortable with articles existing under multiple categories.
   * Half of the editors suggested implementing a linear progression for articles within a category. They envisioned each category telling a story of progress, starting with rudimentary information and gradually advancing.
   * Article links on the front page can introduce editors to information they didn't know was available in the Knowledge Base. As they looked through the titles, some editors were surprised to find coverage on certain topics, as they were unaware that there were articles on those subjects.

**Accessibility opportunities**
* One editor noted that the font appeared on the small side, expressing concern that some colleagues might find it challenging to read.
* Vet Center editors use a dashboard for their tasks. One VC editor recommended incorporating elements from this dashboard, such as language or icons, to bridge their knowledge gap.

**Knowledge Base article feedback**
* What can be improved
   * Editors wish articles included additional media, such as screenshots and other visuals, to aid in comprehension.
   * Critical concern: Precisely outline the individuals authorized to execute specific editing tasks. Two editors voiced frustration after attempting to learn a task, thoroughly reading the article multiple times, and eventually reaching out to the help desk in surrender, only to discover they didn't have permission for the task in the first place.
   * Write KBAs in plainer language and maintain consistent styling, such as using numbered lists throughout and proper formatting.
* What's working
   * Editors appreciate seeing the date of the last update on article pages. This lets them know when the information was last reviewed or revised, ensuring its relevance and accuracy.
   * Editors like having all elements of a story consolidated onto one page instead of separate articles so they don’t have to hop from article to article. 


## Recommendations

1. Consider adding clear, distinct sections to the Knowledge Base landing page to make it easier for editors to find what they need. This way, they can get answers faster and feel less frustrated.
   * New editors require more support to build confidence. Consider creating a section that explains the essential basics they need to know.
   * Editors suggested additional sections that could be both helpful and interesting, such as:
      * Articles for facility or function-specific editors (i.e., VAMC, Vet Center, CAIA, VBA…)
      * Articles focusing on common activities (i.e., Building a page in Drupal, adding media, FAQs, most visited pages, training)
      * Articles explaining editing access according to permission level
      * New feature announcements and accompanying KBAs on how to use these features
   * Lean on analytics data from visit history and search behavior to inform which articles to feature on the front page of the Knowledge Base

2. Review and improve the language across the Knowledge Base, focusing on clarity and universal understanding.
   * Make sure the writing is clear enough for everyone to understand.
   * Stick to a consistent style guide.
   * Consider adding more help text on the landing page to orient users to the kinds of answers and information available in the Knowledge Base.

3. Optimize the search experience.
   * Ensure consistent highlighting of search terms in search results.
   * Consider providing options for editors to refine search results for more targeted and relevant information. 
     * For example, filtering by facility type (e.g., VAMC, VC, VBA…)
    * Consider adding an auto-completion feature that predicts and suggests relevant queries as editors type. This could not only streamline the process to find known information, but also helps editors when they are uncertain about which terms to use. 
4. Create meaningful metrics by which to monitor and evaluate editors’ experiences with the Knowledge Base. A few suggestions: 
   * Metric: Knowledge Base adoption and utilization
      * Measurement: Frequency of Knowledge Base usage as the primary learning resource over time.
   * Metric: Article effectiveness in building editor confidence
      * Measurement: Assessing how well Knowledge Base articles explain concepts, contributing to editors' confidence when implementing actions on their websites.
   * Metric: Search satisfaction
      * Measurement: Satisfaction levels based on editor feedback regarding the search functionality.
5. Consider addressing the diverse needs of all editors, ensuring accessibility for individuals with different abilities.
   * Enhance accessibility by incorporating familiar mental models, such as visual cues, to connect the information in the Knowledge Base with the editors' work in the CMS.
      * For example, use similar icons to those found within the CMS or on familiar dashboards to bridge the knowledge gap and facilitate instant recognition and understanding. 
   * Consider increasing the font size for improved visibility.
