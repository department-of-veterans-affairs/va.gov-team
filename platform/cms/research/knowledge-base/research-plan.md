# Research Plan for Understanding CMS Editors’ Knowledge Base Needs
VFS-CMS, November 2023
## Background
As part of our continuous support for CMS editors, we understand the importance of providing on-demand answers and easy access to information. Currently, the Knowledge Base serves as our primary self-service resource, enabling editors to readily access the answers and information necessary for their work. However, we have uncovered certain insights that suggest the current organizational structure within the Knowledge Base may be lacking in terms of efficiency and usability. 
 

To address these concerns and further enhance the self-service experience for CMS editors, we are conducting an in-depth study to gain a deeper understanding of the information retrieval needs of our editors. We aim to translate these insights into a more intuitive information architecture and organizational structure within the Knowledge Base. Our objective is to better understand editors’ needs and expectations of the Knowledge Base so that we can design a self-service resource that seamlessly aligns with their goals, ensuring they can easily find the information they need for success. 

### OCTO Objectives
By supporting the editor experience:
* We will increase the quality and reliability of VA services 
* Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information 
* Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov 
* Editors will be able to efficiently deliver accurate and updated Veteran and beneficiary content thanks in part to easy access to self-service options, enhancing the overall quality and reliability of VA services. 
## Research Goals
* Determine how the current content structure of the Knowledge Base aligns with editors’ needs and expectations. 
* Understand how editors currently navigate and search for content within the Knowledge Base. 
* Identify specific challenges, pain points, and frustrations editors encounter during their information retrieval processes.  
* Explore editors’ preferences for the organization and categorization of content within the Knowledge Base. 
* Gather insights to inform improvements in the findability, searchability, and overall organizational structure of the Knowledge Base. 
### Outcomes

* Improved information architecture that is more intuitive and user-centered 
* A better understanding of how to improve search for an optimized experience  
* A deeper understanding of how editors prefer to categorize and organize content, which may lead to new categorization methods (like tagging) and improved content groupings 
* An increase in editor productivity due to a reduction in the time and effort it takes them to find, access, and manage content 
### Research questions
* What specific goals do editors have in mind when accessing the Knowledge Base? 
  * How do those objectives influence their interactions with the system?   
* How do editors currently navigate and search for content within the Knowledge Base? 
  * What specific challenges do they encounter during this process? 
* What are editors’ key needs and preferences when it comes to organizing and categorizing content within the Knowledge Base? 
  * How do these align with the current structure?  
* How do users naturally group and categorize information or topics within the Knowledge Base?  
  * Are there recurring patterns or groupings that emerge from card sorting results? 
  * What labels or terminology do users associate with specific content categories? 

### Hypotheses
* Editors have differing levels of experience with the Knowledge Base.  
* Editors’ information retrieval skills may vary, with some being more adept at searching for and retrieving content than others.  
* Editors’ comfort and familiarity with digital tools affects their ability to use the Knowledge Base effectively.  
* Editors’ workload impacts their engagement with the Knowledge Base (both their frequency of use and the depth of their interactions). 
* Editors have specific goals (e.g., research, content creation, or problem solving) when accessing the Knowledge Base. 
* The types of content editors work with impacts their interaction with the Knowledge Base.  

## Method
The one-hour sessions will be conducted in two parts via Zoom.  
 
The first part will involve a usability test with a semi-structured interview. Testers will be asked to complete a navigation task(s) in the Knowledge Base to assess its effectiveness and identify areas of improvement. We will further discuss mental models and expectations of information retrieval within the Knowledge Base.  

The second part of the session will consist of a card sorting exercise, where editors will categorize and name content groupings. This exercise aims to uncover their preferences for information organization and plain language needs across the Knowledge Base.
