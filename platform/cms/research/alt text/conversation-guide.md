# Conversation Guide for Editor-facing Alt Text Creation 
VFS-CMS June 2023
## Moderator logistics
* _Mute your Slack notifications_
* _Before the session, send out the observer instructions to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel)._
* _Make sure notetakers and observers have access to Mural board (or wherever group feedback will be collected)_
* _In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute._
* _Check your screen sharing setup and share permissions for participants._
* _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro_
## Intro - 3 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Joann and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. I'm going to ask them to wave hello and then they will turn off their cameras to limit distractions while we talk. Today we're going to talk about creating alternative text, also known as alt text, within the CMS. Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
* This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to make it easier for site editors to update their content. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* You'll be interacting with the content management system in a training environment, so don’t worry, none of your actions today will affect the actual VA website.
* We can stop the session at any time. If you want to stop, just let me know. 
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. When we present our research none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
* Start recording.
    * I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
Before we look at the website, I'd like to learn a little more about you and your work.
* Can you tell me a bit about your role? 
    * What generally makes up your day? 
    * What percentage of your work is with the CMS? 
    * How do you typically engage with the CMS?
* Have you ever created alt text before? If so, how comfortable are you with the process? 
* Have you received any training or guidance on creating alt text? 
* What do you think alt text is and what purpose do you think it serves? 
* What do you find most challenging about creating alt text in general? 
* Have you ever used any other CMSs or tools for creating alt text? If so, can you tell me about your experience with those tools? 
* How do you approach creating alt text for different types of content, like video, charts, and infographics?
* Can you describe any challenges or successes you have had in your experience working with alt text within the CMS, and what you learned from those experiences? 
## Log in - 5 minutes
* Now I have a few activities that I'd like you to do in the CMS. While you do them, please think aloud and vocalize your thoughts and decisions. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn.
    * I’m going to drop the link to the training site into Zoom Chat. [add URL: https://training-qtpbfivdfzrlrlyiqwmanznaobpek1ca.demo.cms.va.gov/media/add/image]
    * Click "Developer log in" and then add your email address as the username, and use the password “drupal8”. I’ve also added that password in the zoom chat if you prefer to copy and paste
    * Download this image [smiley face]
    * Now that we’re in the training environment, can you share your screen with me so I can follow along with what you're doing? 
## First Task: Add image, current way - 10 minutes
* To start, let’s walk through the current process for adding alt text. 
* Let’s start by going directly to “Add image.” 
* Go ahead and upload that image you just downloaded. 
* Now, fill in the info as you normally would, talking me through your process as you go. 
* As you were writing that text, was there anything you were unsure about? Anything that made you think, “am I doing this right?” 
* Was the inline guidance helpful in creating alt text?
* Is there information that isn’t currently there that would make it easier to create alt text? Think as big as you want here! 
* How confident are you in the alt text you just created? 
    * What would help you feel more confident? 
* If they need a nudge in the wrong direction: Just for demonstration purposes, can you create alt text that is deliberately wrong?
## Second task: Lengthy alt text (Flow 1) - 5 minutes
* Now we’re going to walk through a series of screens that approximate the new alt text creation experience, and I’d like to hear your thoughts on each of these. 
* _[Mod will open prototype to step right before the error message]_
* First up, can you describe what’s happening on this page? 
* If they mention the alt text looks good…
    * What makes you think it’s “good”? 
* I’m going to take you to the next step…. 
* Can you describe what you’re seeing here? 
* I’m going to take us one more step. 
* Can you describe what you’re seeing here? 
* What do you think will happen when you hit save? 
* Go ahead and save this. 
* Now what do you see?
* What do you think about the error messaging? 
* How do you feel about the timing of the error message? That is, how do you feel about receiving it after submission?
    * Would you prefer to receive error feedback as you create alt text or after submitting the information?
* Do you have any suggestions for how this error messaging could be improved?  
* What do you think happens if you click on “alternative text” at the top? 
## Third Task: File name (Flow 2) - 5 minutes
* Ok let’s walk through another scenario. 
* _[Mod will take them to the file name flow]_
* Just like before, can you describe what’s happening on this page? 
* What do you think will happen when you hit save? 
* Go ahead and try saving. 
* Now what do you see?
* What do you think about the error messaging? 
* How do you feel about the timing of the error messaging? 
* Do you have any suggestions for how this error messaging could be improved? 

## Fourth Task: Oops all errors (Flow 3) - 5 minutes
* Ok let’s walk through one more scenario. 
* _[Mod will take them to the multiple errors flow]_
* Can you describe what’s happening on this page? 
* What do you expect will happen when you hit save? 
* Go ahead and try saving. 
* Now what do you see?
* How do you feel about seeing the errors like this?
* How would you go about fixing this alt text? You don’t have to give me actual content, just describe your process. 
* Do you have any suggestions for how this error messaging could be improved? 
## Post-task interview - 5 minutes
* Can you compare and evaluate the proposed flow for creating alt text with the current flow? Which do you prefer, and why? 
* Based on your experience with the prototype, what went well in terms of creating alt text?
* Were there any specific parts of the process that you found particularly challenging or confusing? 
* How do you feel about the guidance and error messaging provided in the prototype? 
* Do you have any suggestions on how the overall process for creating alt text could be improved? 
* Ask any additional follow-up questions from #feedback-backchannel
* Is there anything else you’d like to share about your experience or feedback on the prototype? 
* _If there’s time:_ Have you been facing any other challenges within the CMS that you’d like to discuss? The floor is yours!
