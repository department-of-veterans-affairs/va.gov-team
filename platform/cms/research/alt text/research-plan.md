# Research Plan for Editor-facing Alt Text Creation
VFS-CMS, May 2023
## Background
Alternative text (alt text) is a crucial component of web accessibility, as it provides a means of conveying visual content to individuals who are visually impaired or have difficulty seeing certain types of content. However, the creation of accurate alt text descriptions can be challenging, particularly for Drupal CMS editors who may lack prior experience with and knowledge of creating plain and accessible language for the web. This circumstance may be exacerbated when editors have low confidence in using the CMS.
 
To assist editors with this task, we are proposing an enhancement to the existing workflow presented during the image upload process: in addition to the inline guidance that currently exists within the flow, we propose to include descriptive error messaging that will provide editors detailed feedback on the success or failure of their actions.

### OCTO Objectives
By supporting the editor experience:
* We will increase the quality and reliability of VA services
* Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
* Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov
## Research Goals
* Understand editors’ familiarity with alt text requirements and the importance of good alt text.
* Understand editors’ familiarity and comfort levels with creating alt text 
* Determine if editors know where to go to get guidance on writing alt text
* Evaluate the helpfulness of the inline guidance accompanying the image upload process 
* Evaluate editors’ satisfaction with proposed error message handling
* Understand editors’ overall experience and satisfaction with the proposed alt text creation process 
### Outcomes

* A better understanding of editors’ prior knowledge and experience with creating alt text will enable the development of tailored training to meet their needs. 
* Editors’ improved confidence in the accuracy and effectiveness of their alt text descriptions will improve the overall accessibility of web content written on the CMS. 
* Improved error messaging may serve to implicitly educate editors on alt text best practices and will increase the overall accuracy of alt text descriptions accompanying images. 
* High levels of satisfaction with the alt text creation process will indicate that the process is effective and meets the needs of editors. 
* If editors find the alt text creation process easy to use, it will likely lead to increased adoption of best practices across the CMS. 
### Research questions
* What are editors’ prior knowledge and experience with creating alt text?
  * Do editors know where to look for alt text guidance?
  * What are common challenges and barriers editors face when creating alt text? 
  * How confident are editors in the accuracy and effectiveness of their alt text descriptions?
* Are the ways in which we handle error messaging within the prototype satisfactory?
  * How do editors prefer to receive feedback; i.e., real-time or delayed? 
  * Does the error messaging make sense and provide enough context to the editor to make the appropriate changes?
* What aspects of the inline guidance are most effective at assisting editors in creating alt text?
  * What improvements can be made to the inline guidance to make it more helpful and informative for editors?
  * How much do editors rely on inline guidance when creating alt text?
* What is editors’ overall satisfaction with the proposed alt text creation process?
  * How easy or difficult do editors find the proposed alt text creation process?

### Hypotheses
* Editors arrive at the CMS with varying levels of familiarity and understanding of alt text best practices. 
* Editors may lack confidence in the accuracy and effectiveness of the alt text descriptions they write. 
* Pairing inline guidance with descriptive error messaging will help editors create more accurate and effective alt text descriptions. 
* Error messaging within the current experience is not satisfactory, and editors do not receive enough information to resolve errors easily. 
* Editors’ overall experience and satisfaction with the alt text creation process will be influenced by factors such as ease of use, clarity of instructions and messaging, and helpfulness of guidance.
## Method
Usability testing and semi-structured interviews conducted via Zoom 
### Research materials
Conversation guide 
Prototype
### Participants and Recruitment
* Participants will be recruited via the participant panel, which is made up of editors who have opted in to take part in CMS research studies. 
* Criteria

      * 1-2 who feel positively towards the CMS
      * 1-2 who feel negatively towards the CMS
    * 3 Vet Center
      * 1-2 who feel positively towards the CMS
      * 1-2 who feel negatively towards the CMS
