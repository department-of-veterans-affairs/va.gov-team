This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 


**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings
**1. The alt text field size is limiting**
* The alt text input field allows around 75 characters to be visible at one time; if the alt text is longer than this, editors have to manually move their cursors within the box to read and edit the text. 
  > "I hate having a field where I can't see the whole thing. I want to see everything that I'm writing." - P1

   > "It doesn't all fit in the screen and I need to see it all at once. Otherwise, it's not helpful" - P5

**2. The alt text field is easy to miss**
* A few participants glossed over the alt text section, despite having uploaded an image. They expected it to be either left aligned with the other input fields or directly below the image, not in the middle of the screen and under other copy. 
   > "So, there's no alt text? Ohh there's the alt text." - P4

**3. The cut-off preview image in alt text thumbnail is confusing**
* Almost every editor pointed out that the image, once uploaded, was cropped in the thumbnail. They would prefer to see the entire image, even in thumbnail size. They think it would help them craft more descriptive alt text. 
   > "It really irritates me." - P5

   > "If I'm supposed to be describing something, don't I need to be able to see the whole thing?" - P1
* Two editors tried resizing the image within the thumbnail using the resizing options below the alt text section, not realizing those options were to adjust how the image appears on the website, not the alt text thumbnail. Though not within the scope of this research study, this revealed a deeper confusion from an editor who wasn’t sure how what they saw within the CMS differed from what a website user saw on the front end. 
   > "That's a frustration for me. I kept going back through and resizing and resizing and resizing and I didn't have to." - P5

   > "My struggle with Drupal is getting an image that will actually display properly." - P4

**4. Links to “Learn more” about alt text are both helpful _and_ disruptive**
* One editor who had “no clue” what alt text is or how to begin to write it found this section very helpful, in particular the examples provided. It gave them a better idea of what was expected of them.
* One editor noted that there seemed to be “a lot” of links in the “Tips for alternative text” section.
   > "Is this all the same information?"  - P1
* Two editors resented having to click into the “Learn more about alt text guidelines” page for more information. One of those editors noted that clicking into this page and then going back to the editing screen in the CMS erases any work they’d done in the alt text section (including uploading the image and writing alt text). 
   > "There is space on the page to explain accessibility more without having people click off to what that is. I want less clicking of links and just having important information right there so I don't have to click away." - P1

   > On going between the Learn More page and CMS editor interface: "Then you're just going back and forth and it's frustrating." - P6

**5. Color indicators for character limits are not obvious.**
* In the prototype, we have proposed the idea of highlighting the alt text field green, yellow, or red to indicate to the editor how close to the character limit they are. In practice, no one vocalized noticing the green or yellow indicators. Only a few editors noticed the red indicator. It is possible that the outline appears fainter than it actually is, though, due to testing over Zoom and different internet connections; that is, it is possible that screen resolution played a role in reducing the visibility of this color indicator.
   > "The red could be brighter." - P1 

**6. “Characters remaining” provides clear direction.**
* Every editor noticed the “characters remaining” countdown as an indicator of how close to or over the limit they might be. Some did take longer than others. 

**7. A 150-character limit might be too limiting.**
* In two cases, editors pointed out that our best practice bullet point to “be descriptive” seems counter to the practice to “be concise” in 150 characters. 
   > “It’s super limiting [...] You need at least 300 characters. You need much more space. 150 is not enough to do justice to even the most simple descriptions."  - P3

   > Sarcastically: "Explain it but do it in 150 chars and make it a full sentence." - P5

   > “Big complaint! You can't type a lot when it says you have [150] characters. That's something I run into quite a bit when I try to upload the activities and groups that we do." - P6

**8. Editors prefer more immediate error messages**
* Three out of five editors said they would prefer receiving the error messages before hitting save, that way they could fix the problem in the moment. 
   > "I would be annoyed [at getting it after save]. When you think you’ve finished something and you hit save, you don't want to go back [...] I'm emotionally done with this now." -P1

    > "It's nice that it says that, but I've already invested all my time in typing the whole thing out." -P4 

    > One editor compared it to writing an essay in a word document, where you’re notified of your spelling and grammar mistakes immediately and can correct it as you go: "You're going to miss something if you wait until the end.” -P5

**9. Showing contextual error messages is an opportunity to surprise and delight editors.**
* One editor in particular was extremely excited about the prospect of receiving the new error messages, despite receiving them after hitting “save”. 
   > **“I think something like this is a gamechanger.** [...] It's forcing people to do their jobs! It's a level of accountability that the VA is sorely lacking.” -P3
