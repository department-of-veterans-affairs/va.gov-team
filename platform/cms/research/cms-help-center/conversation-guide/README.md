# Conversation Guide for CMS Help Center and JSD widget Study

## Introduction

_(About 2 minutes)_

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jordana, and I'm a designer and researcher for the Drupal CMS. I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes for me. Today we're going to be testing a proposal for the CMS help center and for requesting help from the CMS team. During this test, I will share my screen with you and, at some point, ask you to take control of my screen, so that you can interact with the demo environment.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the new CMS to better meet your needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

You'll be interacting with a demo environment this session. This means that you will be interacting with a replica of CMS and that any edits or changes won't be published on VA.gov.

If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

_Start recording_

I want to verify that you are okay with me recording screen and audio today.


## Warm-up Questions

_(About 3 minutes)_

- What are your primary tasks in the CMS?

- How often do you use the CMS? 
  
- Have you ever reached out to the CMS team? If so, what were the reasons and how did you do it? 


## Main activities

Now, I have a few activities that I'd like you to do in the demo environment. I ask you to let me know when you think you finished the activity. While you are navigating and using the system, we ask that you please think aloud and vocalize your thoughts and decisions. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn.

#### Activity 1: Submit a request for support

_Share link:_ https://pr3850-geb9i1vxs7ugc9kzpbajhiyfirxs1npl.ci.cms.va.gov/health-care/covid-19-vaccine

You're proofing the COVID-19 vaccines content and you notice that the Preview functionality isn’t working in the way you expect. 

* __Task 1.1:__ Using the resources available in the CMS, let someone in the CMS team know about what you noticed. 

_Share link:_ https://pr3850-geb9i1vxs7ugc9kzpbajhiyfirxs1npl.ci.cms.va.gov/health-care/covid-19-vaccine

You're proofing the COVID-19 vaccines content and realized that it would be beneficial for editors to be able to add comments to specific parts of the text.

* __Task 1.2:__ Using the resources available in the CMS, reach out to the CMS team to suggest this improvement.

#### Activity 2: Submit a request for support via widget on the bottom left part of the page

_Share link_: https://pr3850-geb9i1vxs7ugc9kzpbajhiyfirxs1npl.ci.cms.va.gov/user/1333

You’re new to the CMS and want to better understand the notion of sections. 

* __Task 2.1:__ Look to see if there is information available on this topic. 

_Share link, if needed_: https://pr3850-geb9i1vxs7ugc9kzpbajhiyfirxs1npl.ci.cms.va.gov/help/cms-basics/sections

After reading the information, you still don't have enought clarity about why you see only a few sections on your user profile, but all the sections on your top menu. 

* __Task 2.2:__ Using the resources available in the CMS, ask for more information about this topic. 


## Additional Questions

_About 3 minutes_

That is all the activities I have for us today. I just have a few final questions for you. 

* Did anything surprise you about requesting CMS support? 

* Did you find anything frustrating about the process?

* From 1 to 5, what is your level of confidence when it comes to submitting a help request to the right place and that someone is on the other end to help you?
  
* If you had to describe the process of requesting CMS support to a friend, what would you tell them? 

* Do you have any other feedback you'd like to share based on what you saw and did today? 

* Do you have any other questions for me before we wrap up? 



## Closing
