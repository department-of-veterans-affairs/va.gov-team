# Research Plan for VFS-CMS, January 2021

## Goals
This research plan is for the VFS-CMS - VFS-CMS team.

The VFS-CMS is VA.gov's content management system that provides the structured content templates, workflows and governance that help various teams at VA serve veterans accurate, accessible, up-to-date content.

Our goal for this research is to **evaluate the redesign the CMS Help Center and understand if the process to request help desk support via JSD widget is straightforward to CMS users**. 

#### Research Questions
* Can users request support successfully?
* Does the JSD form provide enough context and feedback to make users feel confident that they submitted their request to the right place and that someone is on the other end to help them?
* Do fields and instructions available in the JSD form match how CMS users think about communicating a request for support?
* Are users aware of the help function on the CMS Help Center sub-pages?

#### What knowledge will make us feel like the research process has been successful?
Developing an uderstanding of how the redesigned CMS Help Center enables users to get the support they need will show our research process has been successful. In particular, identifying what adjustments are needed in the JSD form, if any.

## Method	

**What method of research are you planning?**
30-minute remote _Thinking Aloud Test_ in a demo environment with new CMS Help Center, followed by follow-up questions.

This session will not be recorded. We'll use verbatim notes to register the session, followed by synthesized notes on our observations.

**Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?**
The _Thinking Aloud Test_ was chosen because we're interested in users' thoughts and reactions as they move through the user interface. 

**Where are you planning to do your research?**
Online, via Zoom. Remote observers and note takers will be in attendance.
