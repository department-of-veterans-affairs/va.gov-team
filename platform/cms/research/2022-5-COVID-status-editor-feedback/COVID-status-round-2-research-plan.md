# Research Plan for COVID Facility Operating Status – June 2022

## Background

In July 2020, in the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic, OCTODE and VHA Digital Media collaborated with the local facilities and the Lighthouse team to create a single source of truth to help inform Veterans of the status of services at each health care facility through the use of the free-text Facility Status in Drupal. 

In May of 2022, VHA's Office of Health Transformation (OHT) wished to standardize the messaging around the patient experience and introduced 3 levels of standard COVID-19 health protection guidelines. These guidelines are based upon a high, medium, or low transmission rate in a facility's locality based on CDC transimssion rate data, updated each Monday. VAMC editors in Drupal CMS must select the current level for their locations (High, Medium, or Low) that then associates national standard guidance for the facility. This guidance lets Veterans see the level for any specific health care facility location on VA.gov and the associated national standardized guidance. 

The language describing a facility’s COVID operating status is managed centrally by the VA.gov Content Team in coordination with the Office of Health Transformation (OHT) and the COVID Communication Task Force. The text focused on (1) Masking (2) Screening (3) Visitors and (4) Virtual Care. It was created by VACO to be general enough to encompass a variety of use cases at the facility level; however, the field was not consulted before crafting the messages. The associated text is as follows:

| Level | Masking/Physical Distancing | Screening | Visitors | Virtual Care |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| High | Everyone must wear a mask and practice physical distancing | We may screen you for COVID-19 symptoms at the entrance. | Approved visitors only. Ask your care team who can visit. | Ask your team about phone or video appointment options. |
| Medium | Everyone must wear a mask | Your care partner is welcome (no other visitors). | Please self-screen. If you've had any COVID-19 symptoms in the past 48 hours, call first unless you need care now. | N/A |
| Low | Everyone must wear a mask | Visitors are welcome | Please self-screen. If you've had any COVID-19 symptoms in the past 48 hours, call first unless you need care now. | N/A |

During the roll-out/adoption, some facilities expressed concern that their local policies don’t align with the national language. This resulted in some facilities not adopting the new messaging protocol. In addition, for those that did adopt the messaging, the visitor policy directing Veterans to "ask your care team who can visit" has resulted in an increase of calls to local facilities.

Some Drupal CMS editors have worked around the challenges by adding further details related to COVID-19 health protection guidelines to other parts of their website. For example, as of June 22, 2022, 97 facilities have supplemental COVID-related information published in their full-width banner alerts which result in a degraded Veteran experience on the websites (large amounts of text, multiple banners, etc).
 
## OCTO objectives
### North Star
* Increase the quality and reliability of VA services 

### Goal
* Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information 

### Numbers
* Increasing 
  * Usage of digital, self- service tools 
  * Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov 
* Decreasing 
  * Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution 

### Veteran journey
Veterans entering the fourth stage of their VA journey (Starting up) start to seek out VA services to attend to their healthcare needs. This can be the start of an ongoing set of interactions with their VAMC facility that likely will require onsite visits. 

The COVID status of their chosen facility is vital to helping Veterans understand what to expect so they can plan their next visit. For those relying on the web channel for information, VA.gov plays an instrumental role in describing a facility’s COVID status and related visitation rules.

## Research goals
The primary goals of this research are to understand from the perspective of Public Affairs Officers (PAOs):
* how the COVID-19 facility operating status content aligns with the on-the-ground policies and procedures at each facility
* what parts of the messaging are successful
* what parts of the messaging is confusing/conflicting or resulting in additional contact load for staff at the local facilities

## Outcomes
The results of this research will be used to develop recommendations for OCTO-DE and OHT to inform a future direction for how to inform Veterans about the impact of COVID-19 protection levels at a specific facility and how that may impact their health care journey.

## Hypothesis
The standardized COVID health protection guidelines do not reflect the actual policies and practices at local VAMC facilities. This creates multiple problems for Veterans and staff including: confusion for Veterans both before a visit and when they arrive, an increasing the burden on the the VA staff who may have to clarify the policies. This confusion and misalignment can slow the Veteran's ability to receive care.

## Research Questions
* What specific language is working or not working at the facility level? Why? 
* What other COVID messages do PAOs want to convey to Veterans, that are not covered by the national language? 
* How do PAOs decide on additional COVID messages about visitation they want to add to the website?  
* What feedback have Veterans given about the COVID messages on the website? 
* When editors need to convey info about their facilities, how do they choose among facility status, COVID status, system operating status, and banner alerts?  
  
## Method
* Semi-structured interviews 
  
## Location
* Remote, via Zoom 
  
## Research materials
* [Conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/cms/research/2022-5-COVID-status-editor-feedback/COVID-status-round-2-conversation-guide.md) 

## Recruitment
The CMS Facilities team will work with VHA Digital Media to recruit 6-7 PAOs for this research using the the following criteria:
* Are at the facility, not VISN level 
* Represent an equal mix of urban and rural areas 
* Represent large and small geographic territories 
* Have not been involved in previous research with the CMS Facilities team 
  
## Timeline
* June 28:  
  * CMS Facilities research team to share research plan with OCTO-DE and OHT for input 
  * VHA DM to identify 12 potential participants for interviews 
* June 29: CMS Facilities research team to start scheduling participants for interviews while starting conversation guide draft 
* July 1 - 8: Interviews with PAO participants 
* July 11-15: Synthesis of research findings, including data from help desk, and development of readout deck and recommendations for discussion with OCTO-DE Product Owner Dave Conlon 
* July 21: readout of research findings and recommendations with Dave Conlon, Danielle Thierry, and representatives from VHA Digital Media and OHT
