## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. We really appreciate you taking the time to talk with us! 

Today we're going to talk about your experience with the new COVID facility operating status and how the national language matches up with the actual operations at your facility.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
* This entire session should take 30 minutes or less. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. Our goal is to improve these tools to better meet the needs of site editors and of Veterans. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. 
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. When we present the results of this research, none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
*Start recording.*
* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Interview Questions 

### Intro
Before we dive in to the COVID facility status, I’d like to learn a little bit more about your work. 

* What’s your role at the VA? 
* How long have you been in this role?
* What are your responsibilities for the website?
* What’s your favorite part of your job?
 
 
### COVID facility operating status
As you know, at the end of May VHA implemented a new COVID facility status, to give Veterans consistent information about COVID health protection guidelines at VAMC facilities. 
* In general, how has this effort been going for you so far? 

Now we’ll take a look at the COVID health protection guidelines. 

*Screenshare the table that shows the COVID level guidelines.*  

* What level is your facility at now? 
* Looking at the COVID health protection guidelines for that level, what specific language is working or not working for your facility? Why? (make sure they address each line)
* Looking at the guidelines for the other two levels, what language would or would not apply to your facility? Why? (make sure they address each line)
* What other COVID-related facility messages did you want to convey to Veterans, that are not covered by the national language?
* Have you added any additional messages to the website about how COVID levels might affect their visit? 
  * Where do you put those messages?
  * Who is telling you what messages to include?
* What feedback have Veterans given about the COVID-related facility messages on the website?
* If you could wave a magic wand and change one thing about the COVID status messages on the website, what would you do? 

### Operating status

Changing gears a little, I’m also curious about how you convey other types of information about your facility to Veterans. 

*Screenshare, logged in as them in staging. Navigate to each content type to have a visual aid.*

I’m logged into the CMS as you. This is not the live site–I can’t make any changes, so don’t worry. This is just to have a visual aid. 

* When do you use [content type]?  
  * Facility operating status
  * System operating status
  * Banner alert
  * Situation update
* Is there anywhere else you would put that type of information?
* How do you decide whether to put the info at the facility level or the system level? 

### Closing
We’re almost at the end of our time. Before we close, 

* [notetaker] do you have anything you wanted to follow up on?
* [Participant], do you have any questions for us? 

Thank you so much for sharing your feedback. It will help us make the CMS work better  for all VAMC editors, so that you can get Veterans the information they need.
