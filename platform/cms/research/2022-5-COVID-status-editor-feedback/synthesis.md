## Research questions
- Do editors understand the new approach to the operating status?
- Does the help text and labels in the editorial experience contribute to editor’s understanding of the task?
- What other contextual information should we consider when designing for this task?
- How do editors respond to the new task, as introduced in the study? (We read some copy from the announcement email to get feedback)

## Insights

Insight 1 
### Participants responded positively to the design for the COVID-19 levels fields.
Both participants expressed that the editorial experience on the VAMC facility form was clear. Seeing the Veteran-facing content helped them feel confident about their choices.
 - “I like the simplicity. I like that we can see exactly what it’s going to say up front, that’s genius, that you’ve pre-done it for us.” 

Insight 2
### Participants were enthusiastic about the standardization effort.
Both participants strongly supported the effort to standardize COVID-19 guidelines and communications. They emphasized that it’s helpful to understand the benefit of the new process.
- “It’s a feeling of security to take away some of the questions people have, it will help to give all of us that one look and one voice.” 
- “The why is important. Sometimes things just get thrown at us. We want to know why and what the end result will be for Veterans.”

Insight 3 
### Participants clearly understood the different intent for the operating and COVID-19 statuses.

When asked about how they’d use the operating status in the new design, the participants’ responses aligned with guidance. They seemed to get the need to “clear out” COVID content from the operating status details.
- “This is where I would normally have had a facility notice about covid. I would take that off [once COVID-19 level is in place]. I wouldn’t want to have two notices, that would make me look unprofessional. It would erode Veteran trust.”

Insight 4
### When the COVID-19 levels change, editors may need to use the operating status details to communicate about incidental impacts.

Both participants said they’d still consider using operating status details for certain locally-specific changes that might arise due to COVID protocols. 
- “[when COVID protocols change] I’d ask myself: What other operational things might shift or change that might affect Veterans?”

Examples they gave:
- When the facility needs to close down certain entrances to facilitate screening 
- Changes to parking and check in procedures as a result of COVID protocols
- Availability of certain health services, for example, limiting surgeries 
- Closure of certain amenities, such as the pool and gym


Insight 4 
### The workflow could be burdensome for systems in urban areas where levels are unlikely to differ between facilities.
- “It would require opening up 15 different pages [to set covid status], and that would be kind of annoying…especially if changes are often.”

Insight 5
### One participant was concerned that the Veteran-facing guidelines didn’t provide specific enough guidance about caregivers.
They weren’t sure their audience would understand who their care team is, in part because their system has different teams for inpatient and outpatient care.

## Tangents - not directly related but need attention 

Topic 1
### Banner alert length / COVID content in banner alerts
Both participants brought up the system banner alert, and speculated about how they’d approach it differently given the new COVID status. One also expressed concern about the long banners on other systems’ sites.
- “ I kept it [the banner] short and simple because you don’t want to cover too much of the website.”

Opportunity: 
Provide guidance about how to approach COVID content in banner alerts to encourage best practices. 


Topic 2
### Publishing times
Participants speculated that the new status could raise concerns about publishing times.
- “Definitely going to rile people up because of our publishing issues. It takes so long to publish alerts, status, etc.” Example: a nearby system had an active shooter situation and it took two hours for the operating status to publish, “which made it useless.” 

Topic 3 
### Banner alert dismissability
Participant reports that VAMC system banner alert dismissibility persists longer than a single session, and is concerned how that impacts the Veteran experience. They also find this difficult when they need to check banner content on their live site.
- "Months ago I dismissed it once, now it’s gone for good, so I can’t even go back and check what it looks like." 

Topic 4
### Support more pictures in stories
Participant expressed that the lack of support for more pictures in story content negatively impacts the quality of story content for Veterans.
- “People like me are writing stories, not just a press release with a quote. It’s a feature story, like something you’d see in a magazine. You need at least 2 or 3, Drupal only lets us have one. Sometimes we tell stories only with photos!”


Topic 5
### Preview is useful
Participants said they frequently use preview to check their work. 
- “If I did something major, I’m hitting Preview. Preview is like Frank’s Red Hot - put that on everything!”
