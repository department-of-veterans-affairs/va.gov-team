[Research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/cms/research/CMS%20Notifications/Notifications-Research-Plan.md)

[Conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/cms/research/CMS%20Notifications/Moderated-Interviews-Conversation-Guide.md)

This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

The goal of this document is:

* To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
* To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
* To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes


## **Initial Findings**

**1. Every Vet Center editor (3 out of 3) mentioned that their Vet Center Director would need to be notified as well if there was outdated content.**

* Notes
    * It is unclear if Vet Center Directors also have accounts to make edits within the CMS.
    * We would need to know who the director is and have a way for us to contact them when content is severely (over 90 days) overdue.


**2. Even though both Vet Center and VAMC editors mentioned that they get lots of emails, most editors (5 out of 6) listed that email is their preferred communication method.**

* Below is a breakdown of answers to the question “Which notification format would be most effective in driving you to take action within the CMS?”
    * Email (5 out of 6)
    * Teams (1 out of 6)
    * Within the CMS only (0 out of 6) 
    * All mentioned that having notifications within the CMS itself would be helpful, but only in conjunction with their preferred contact method.

> “I would see an email quicker than I would see something in the system.” - P1 (VAMC Editor)


> “I do think email is a good way because it creates a paper trail and says, “Hey you were notified with this email.” Then it is on us and we need to make sure we are doing it.” - P4 (Vet Center Editor)


> “Drupal notifications would be less official since I’m not in there as much. The email would catch my attention faster than anything.” -P4 (Vet Center Editor)


> “I check email multiple times a day, so that's pretty simple. In our world, it's a main component of what we do.” -P6 (Vet Center Editor)


**3. When asked to explain their knowledge of VA Directive 6102, most editors interviewed (5 out of 6) could not explain it off the top of their head. However, most (5 out of 6) were familiar with the requirements of the directive when it was explained to them.**

* Notes
    * One (1) person was familiar with with 6102 and could explain it correctly.
    * Four (4) people remembered the protocols of the directive once it was explained, but couldn’t recall what it was when only referring to it as VA Directive 6102.
    * One (1) person was not familiar with the directive at all.

> "Is that the one that makes sure that everything is compliant with photos?" - P1 (VAMC Editor)


> When asked if they were familiar with VA Directive 6102: "A little bit. What I know about it: it's classifications for what we are allowed to put or not put on the website." -P6 (Vet Center Editor)



**4. Editors are exploring the public facing site before logging into the CMS when they find out that updates are needed on the website.**

* Notes
    * One participant mentioned that they never log in to the CMS unless they are told to do so.

> “I will go to the website once a week as a reminder for myself, but I will only really go into the editing side if there’s something I need to change.” - P4 (Vet Center Editor)


**5. There’s not a clear frequency for how often editors log into the CMS to make edits.**

We received the following responses when asked: “How often do you log into the CMS without being prompted to do so?”
* 1 - Daily
* 2 - Weekly
* 1 - Every 2-3 Weeks
* 1 - Monthly
* 1 - Over 1 Month

* Notes
    * Only one person interviewed logs in to the CMS daily, but that person was also in charge of updating multiple VAMC facilities.


**6. Updating the website is not a primary responsibility for the Vet Center editors that were interviewed, but was for the VAMC editors interviewed.**

> “I didn’t even know that updating the website was going to be part of my job.” -P7 (Vet Center Editor)


> “The only problem with the website is we don't get data back from it. We don't know if we have 5 people or a 100 viewing the site. So, we don't put as much effort into the website as we might if we understood who was viewing it. We asked about this in the past. I don't see the website as a miniscule task but it's potentially not as important as it might be.” -P6 (Vet Center Editor)


> “Our quota is 32 hours a week in the field. We do a lot of outreach, driving around, meeting veterans.” When asked how important updating the website was in comparison to their other job duties, they said they don’t think their performance evaluation is based on that. “If I have to meet my quota for the month or do the webpage, I’d be kind of self-serving here.” -P7 (Vet Center Editor)


**7. All participants (6 out of 6) found the email mockup provided the information they needed to fix outdated content, but one participant said that they probably wouldn’t be likely to open the email.**

* The participant that said they wouldn’t be likely to open the email mentioned the following.
    * Teams was their preferred communication method.
    * The emails he gets in his VA email are irrelevant to his job and he sees them as “spammy”.

> “The email grabs my attention. It helps to have the VA directive in there that says this is something you have to do.” -P4 (Vet Center Editor)

> “If I saw it was 30 days overdue, I would do it immediately.” - P6 (Vet Center Editor)

> Having the VA logo makes the email seem more official. -P8 (VAMC Editor)


**8. Although editors may be responsible for updating the website, they might not be the person with knowledgeable on if the information is still accurate.**

* Notes
    * One editor of a larger VAMC system mentioned that he might have to defer to someone who knows if the information is still accurate. This might leave room for error if people don’t do their due diligence and only click through that they have reviewed the outdated content.


**9. VAMC editors are currently receive automated emails from Siteimprove while Vet Center editors don’t get any automated emails about the website.**

* Notes
    * See attached image for an example of an email from Siteimprove
    * Siteimprove is an external service and is not operated by the VA.
    * This is the only other automated notification that was mentioned.
    * Siteimprove only looks at the public facing side of the website and does not direct editors to the place in the CMS where they need to fix a problem.
    * People that mentioned Siteimprove found it helpful in notifying them than an update was needed to their site.

> “Siteimprove gives us information on broken links, misspellings, things of that nature. - P1 (VAMC Editor)

> “There is no one updating me - no email or teams message that tells me ‘Hey you need to go in and do something with your website.’ I have seen emails come through but they don’t pertain to me. They could be related to the website but they are things I’ve already done or don’t pertain to what I’m doing.” - P4 (Vet Center Editor)


**10. If something needs to be escalated, VAMC editors are likely to respond to a request from VHA Digital Media and Vet Centers are likely to respond to their Vet Center Director.**

## Hypothesis and Conclusions

* Editors are familiar with Directive 6102.
    * Maybe True. Most participants were familiar with what the directive calls for, but don’t correlate that with the number of a directive.
* Editors are juggling many competing priorities and only work on their websites when there is a pressing need.
    * Definitely True. This is more true with Vet Centers because most of them are Outreach Specialists, so their primary focus is doing work out in the field that helps Veterans.
* Editors aren't logging into the CMS without being prompted to do so.
    * Definitely True. Whether through a notification of some sort or through with communication with someone else, they’re only loggin into Drupal when they know they need to update/add/change something.
* Notifications can help editors become 6102 compliant.
    * Definitely True. Every person interviewed (6 out of 6) agreed that a notification of some sort would be helpful for them in their current workflow.
* Too many notifications will defeat the purpose of having them and we should be judicious with the use of them.
    * Definitely True. Our current plan of sending a notification email monthly doesn’t seem to be too much, but as we look to expand to different types of notifications we should be mindful of how often those types of notifications are sent.
* Our prototype email conveys all the information an editor needs to fix outdated content.
    * Likely True. One participant mentioned that they wouldn’t be likely to open the email, but that is likely because they listed Teams as their preferred method of communication.

## Additional Insights


Based on our conversations with editors there were some additional insights we found that were not related to VA Directive 6102, but we think should still be mentioned as we continually work to improve the editor experience.

Editors mentioned the following things that they would like to see improved:



* Better image handling
    * Ability to add captions to images
    * Cropping images isn’t accurate to how it might look on the public site.
* Better Analytics
    * It’s hard to know what impact their site is having without knowledge of the views that it is getting.
* More space to put spotlight content.
    * Higher character count.

## Recommendations

* Make adjustments to the email mockup based on feedback from interview sessions.
    * Change subject line.
        * Needs to be more clear that action is needed so that people will open the email
        * One participant had a negative reaction to the word “Report”
    * Combine the 30/60/90 days overdue into a single overdue section. It doesn’t matter how overdue something is because as long as it’s overdue it’s still non-compliant.
    * Make sure the email address that the notification are coming from look like an official source.
* Think about how we can partner with VHA Digital Media and Vet Center Directors when escalation is needed. How do we get in contact with with the people that the editors listen to when they’re not doing what’s required of them?
* Find a way to get Vet Center editors the info that VAMC editors are getting from Siteimprove. Additionally, figure out how to direct VAMC editors to the place in the CMS where they need to make updates based on the information they get from Siteimprove.
* Think about how we can ensure that we’re emailing the right editors. Just because you have edit access in the CMS, doesn’t mean that you’re the one updating everything. Potentially explore the possibility of an unsubscribe button or notification settings so that editors are only getting the notifications that are relevant for them.
* Think about situations when there are more than one person receiving notifications and making updates. How do we prevent people from doing duplicate work and show them that someone else has already taken care of an issue?
