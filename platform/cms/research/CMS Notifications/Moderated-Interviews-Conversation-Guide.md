## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Blake and I am a Product Designer for the VA.

My colleague [NAME] is also with us to take notes as we talk.

My colleague [NAME] is also here to listen in.

I'm going to ask them to wave hello and then they will turn off their cameras to limit distractions while we talk.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:



* This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans’ needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. When we present our research none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_Start recording._



* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today





## Background & Warm-Up Questions - 5 minutes

Today we're going to talk about Drupal CMS notifications. Our team is planning to build a notification system and we are trying to find out how to best inform CMS editors like yourself about any relevant information or action items that you all might need to take to provide the best content for veterans. We want to provide an easy way to directly access the content to act on the notification.

Before we dive in, I’d like to learn about your work in general.



* **Their background:**
    * What’s your role at the VA?
    * How long have you been in this role?
    * How long have you been with the VA?
    * Where in the VA System do you work?
        * VAMC or Vet Center?
        * Where in the US?
* **Their relationship with the CMS and VA Directive 6102:**
    * I noticed in our survey that you put your confidence level with the Drupal CMS as {Low/Med/High}. 
        * Why would you say that you gave it that rating?
    * Would you say that updating the website is your primary job duty?
        * What other priorities in addition to updating the website do you work on?
        * How important is updating the CMS in comparison to your other job duties?
        * How often do you log into the CMS without being prompted to do so?
    * How familiar are you with VA Directive 6102? Can you explain it in your own words to me?
        * **If they’re not familiar**, here’s an explanation if they need it.
            * “VA Directive 6102 aims to update outdated content on VA websites. This directive requires that CMS editors review their content yearly to ensure that information is still relevant. Any outdated content will need to be either updated or removed to comply with Directive 6102.”
        * **If they are familiar**, ask:
            * “How did you hear about VA Directive 6102?”.
            * How does 6102 guide your work on updating the website?





## First Task - 5 minutes
Gain a better understanding of what pain points editors are currently experiencing when receiving relevant information or action items.

**Questions:**
* When updates are needed on the website, who or what is currently notifying you that updates are needed?
* Explain the differences between what types of information you are getting from people at the following levels of leadership.
    * Your facility
    * Regional leadership (VISN)
    * National directive (VHA Digital Media)
* Think of the last time you made an update to the website. Walk me through the process of what it is like when you currently receive a notice that updates are needed to the website.
    * What was the change you needed to make?
    * How did you learn that this change needed to be made?
    * Where did the direction come from?
* What pain points are you currently experiencing when receiving information or action items from the VA about updates needed in the CMS?





## Second Task - 5 Minutes
Gain a better understanding of how notifications could fit into the editor's current workflow.

**Background:**

Is our thought that if the VA can notify editors of relevant information that fits into your established workflow, it will make using the CMS more efficient.

We are currently exploring a few different ways to achieve this. Email notifications, notifications within the CMS, or a combination of both. We are also open to hearing your suggestions if you have them.

**Questions:**
* Emails
    * How many emails do you usually get per day?
    * Are the number of emails you get on a daily basis overwhelming?
    * Are you able to attend to your emails promptly without building up a backlog of tasks?
    * If you were to get an email notification about the CMS, what would make you think that it was important?
* Within the Product
    * Would having notifications within the CMS be beneficial in helping you take necessary actions?
    * Does having notifications within the product fit into your current workflow?
    * If notifications were only located within Drupal CMS, how likely would you be to check those notifications? Would that fit into your current workflow?
* Given what we have discussed, which notification format would be most effective in driving you to take action within the CMS?
    * Email Notifications
    * Notifications within the CMS
    * A combination of both
        * If they answer with this, ask “If you had to choose one over the other, which fits into your workflow better?”




## Third Task - 5 minutes
Show Mockup(s)


**Questions:**
* Does this email convey all the information that you would need to fix outdated content?
    * If not, what additional information would you need to update this outdated content?
* Does this email let you know which tasks would be a higher priority over other tasks?
* Is this email easy to read? Is there too much information on it?
* How likely are you to take action on this email?





## Fourth Task - 5 minutes (If time allows)
Gain a better understanding of what types of notifications would help editors to better serve veterans.

**Questions:**
* Once 6102 notifications are implemented, we are looking at some other notification types that would result in better content for the veterans. Out of this list, which notification type would be most beneficial in helping you provide better content for the veterans?
    * Notifications about…
        * Broken links
        * Inaccessible images
        * Inaccessible PDFs
* Why did you pick that type of notification?
* Is there a type of notification that isn’t listed here that should be added?





## Thank You and Closing - 2 minutes

* _Ask any additional follow-up questions from #feedback-backchannel_
* That's the end of my list of questions. Is there anything we talked about today that you have additional thoughts you want to share?

We appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works for editors such as yourself and the veterans that you serve.

Thank you again, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
