# SOP: Tier 1 Broken Links Scope of Support

Broken links triage and resolution processes are no longer managed by Tier 1. 

Tier 2 now has ownership of broken links and only if an issue involves user content will Tier 1 take ownership. 

Once Tier 1 has ownership it is up to Tier 1 to work with the CMS user on to resolve the broken link. 

If a CMS user does not fix a broken link within 24 hours and Tier 1 help desk support can fix the issue without affecting content, Tier 1 should correct the issue, notate the correction in the Revision Log and notify the CMS user at their VA.gov email address on what to expect and why the action was done. 

# Related Procedures
Tier 1 and Tier 2 both have office hour requirements and other procedures defined in the [SLA](./service_level_agreement.md#help-desk-service-level-agreement-sla).
