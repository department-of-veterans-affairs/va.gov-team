# Password Policy Overview
## Purpose
Veterans rely on accurate and reliable information in order to make decisions about the benefits available to them.  The VA COntent Management Solution (CMS) gives authorized Users a tool to manage information related to Benefits for Veterans and their families. Using the CMS requires a password.  Passwords are an important part of efforts to protect the VA CMS’ information assets from unauthorized access and this policy is designed to establish best practices for the general usage of passwords. 

The VA CMS Help Desk will maintain administrator responsibilities for passwords including:
* Creating User accounts
* Assigning temporary passwords
* Revoking or closing user accounts or blocking account access for compromised accounts
* Performing manual password resets by assigning a temporary password and communicating the temporary password to the CMS User.

## Guidelines
* Your password must be at least twelve characters long.
* Longer passwords may be even stronger. 
* Your password must include a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, AND non-alphanumeric symbols. 
* Your password must contain some type of non-alphanumeric symbol like “,” or “#”.
* Your password may not be the same as your user login ID. 
* Your password may not be blank. 

### Please also consider the following guidelines for safeguarding your password and increasing the security of your CMS User account:

* Your password should not contain any information about you that can be easily discovered, such as a spouse or child’s name, a license plate or street address number. 
* Do not share your password with anyone. 
* If you have reason to believe that your password may have become compromised, change it immediately. 
* Do not write your password down. Keep it in memory only. If you absolutely must write your password down, store it in a secure location accessible only to you. 
* Do not enable settings that allow your Web browser to “remember” your password. 
* Never share your password via e-mail or voice mail. 
* Never display or transmit your password in any communication or online transmission (other than when logging into your account). 
* You must provide your current password before you may select a new password. 
* If you cannot remember your current password, you can click the *Reset Your Password*  link on the login page or submit a Help Desk Ticket to reset your password. 
* Help Desk will first authenticate your identity and then provide you with a temporary password that must be changed upon your next login. 
* After five unsuccessful login attempts, you will be locked out of your user account. It is strongly recommended that you implement a policy for changing your password. 

### The following is a suggested list of guidelines: 
* As a general security measure, you should change your password on a regular basis (at least every 60 days). 
* Change your password immediately if you have any reason to believe that your account is compromised. 
* Change your password immediately if you notice any suspicious activity on your CMS user account.
