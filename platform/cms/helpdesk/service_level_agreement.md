# Help Desk Service Level Agreement (SLA)

## Purpose

The Help Desk should operate according to a Service Level Agreement (SLA) which lays out the terms and conditions of Help Desk support efforts.

Under the SLA, "business hours" are from 8am to 8pm EST, and during these hours the Help Desk team commits to:

    * respond with a First Response to support requests within a set period of time (<30 minutes for all Priority 1 or 2 Tickets); 

    * resolve tickets within a set period of time:

    * Within 24 business hours or 2 business days for any Priority 1 Ticket;

    * Within 4 weeks for Priority 2 Tickets with consideration that work will need to be planned within "Sprints"; 

    * All other Tickets will be categorized as Priority 3 and will be added to the GitHub Backlog where it will then be prioritized against other Tickets in the Backlog with a goal of resolving the Ticket within 2 weeks - consideration that work will need to be planned within "Sprints" is important for Priority 3 too.

    * Track Help Desk performance across key metrics (suggested: performance against SLA times for first response and resolution, displayed by priority level); 

# Criteria

## Priority 1

This is the highest priority, indicative of a critical defect or issue preventing the user from completing their work.  Examples would be an outage, an inability to publish content prior to deadline, "access denied" messages, and similar.

## Priority 2

The scope of P2 Tickets include issues like How-to use various features of the CMS or User Administration.

A First response is required within 30 minutes of the request being made however unlike P1, P2 requests are expected to be resolved within 4 weeks.

## Priority 3

P3 requests are reserved for issues that involve adding or altering a feature to improve the efficiency of the publishing and editing experience for users - or "nice to haves", and minor issues that do not interfere with User ability to publish content. 

# Help Desk Service Hours

Per the contract, the Help Desk will be staffed from 0800 to 2000 EST (0500 to 1700 PST) Monday through Friday.

# Tracking Performance

Per the contract, performance metrics shall be tracked and compiled by the Delivery Manager on a monthly basis, reviewed with the team, and submitted to the client.

SLA adherence will be tracked using the software’s built-in reporting.

# Federal Holidays

All federal government offices close on federal holidays.  Help Desk support support will not operate during Business Hours on Federal Holidays and will stand down.

As a collateral duty, some Tier 2 engineer staff will be assigned and made available "on call" as part of Pager Duty to address critical issues impacting Veterans access to information.  

On Call and Pager Duty procedures are outlined here https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/tree/master/OnCall

For urgent and important issues that require immediate attention, the OnCall Slash Commands for Slack should be made in the #oncall channel and are:

```
/pd trigger
/pd oncall 
```
For context, to mitigate potential issues automated deploys will be suspended.  Engineer-initiated deploys (e.g. to address a critical bug) are not suspended. 

The Help Desk stand down will occur during the following dates for 2021:

| Holiday                      | Observed Date |
