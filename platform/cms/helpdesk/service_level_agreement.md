# Helpdesk Service Level Agreement (SLA)

## Purpose

Helpdesk should operate according to a Service Level Agreement (SLA) which lays out the terms and conditions of Helpdesk customer support efforts.

Under the SLA, the Helpdesk team commits to:

* For the purpose of this document, "business hours" applies to 8am to 8pm ET.

* respond to support requests within a set period of time (<30 minutes, during business hours, if Priority 1 or 2); 

* resolve a minimum percentage of tickets within a set period of time:

    * Within 24 business hours, 2 business days for Priority 1

    * Within 4 weeks for Priority 2 (such that planned work can be identified and added to the next sprint’s work); 

    * Prioritization of an issue as appropriate within 2 weeks for Priority 3 (for which planned work may be identified and may or may not be added to an upcoming sprint)

* Track Helpdesk performance across key metrics (suggested: performance against SLA times for first response and resolution, displayed by priority level); 

# Criteria

## Priority 1

This is the highest priority, indicative of a critical defect or issue preventing the user from completing their work.  Examples would be an outage, an inability to publish content prior to deadline, "access denied" messages, and similar.

First response is required within 30 minutes of the request being made.  Ideally, first response on P1 requests will be nearly immediate.  P1 requests are expected to be resolved within 24 business hours, 2 business days, with a target of 95% of P1 requests being resolved within this timeframe.

## Priority 2

P2 requests are expected to make up the majority of requests.  Examples would include:

* Needing assistance using a CMS feature

* Adjusting permissions for a CMS user

* Adding or removing accounts

First response is required within 30 minutes of the request being made.  P2 requests are expected to be resolved within 4 weeks, with a target of 95% of P2 requests being resolved within this timeframe.

## Priority 3

P3 requests will typically include feature requests, "nice to haves", and minor issues that do not interfere with the customer’s work being completed.  These requests should have a first response time of 30 minutes if there are no higher priority requests to respond to, elsewise they should be responded to as soon as feasible once high priority requests are handled.

P3 requests should be prioritized within 2 weeks and may or may not be scheduled for a future release, with a target rate of 95% of P3 requests prioritized and scheduled within this timeframe.

# Helpdesk Service Hours

Per the contract, the Helpdesk will be staffed from 8:00 to 20:00 EST/5:00-17:00 PST.

# Tracking Performance

Per the contract, performance metrics shall be tracked and compiled by the Delivery Manager on a monthly basis, reviewed with the team, and submitted to the client.

SLA adherence will be tracked using the software’s built-in reporting.
