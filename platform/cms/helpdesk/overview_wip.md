# VA.gov CMS Help Desk Overview

# Mission

The Content Management System Help Desk (VA CMS Help Desk, or just CMS Help Desk) will provide end user support to staff from VA Medical Centers and VA Medical Facilities that utilize the site's various features to publish important information for Veterans to obtain benefits at VA Medical Facilities and VA Medical Centers.  

The CMS Help Desk provides direct support and analysis of Support Channels to ensure the mission critical goal of CMS User's to publish healthcare information critical to a Veteran's success is not impeded or disrupted by technical issues, user error, or defect of the CMS Platform.

This document contains the various procedures, policies, and training resources (some linked to external sites and access will not be granted for all, that is expected and those links will update soon) that will provide a User with a general understanding of how the Help Desk operates and the various procedures and processes that address the internal needs of stakeholders and the external needs of the User. 

## Getting Started

[What is a CMS?](https://prod.cms.va.gov/help/what-is-a-cms)

## How a User Contacts the Help Desk

### Support Channels

The CMS Help Desk currently offers three methods for Users to create a Ticket and enter the Help Desk Support Queue to have their Issue resolved.

### Widget

A javascript widget is embedded on specific pages throughout the CMS that allows Users to create a Ticket with the Help Desk. Users can track their Ticket at https://va-gov.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3

### Slack

Users may also create a Ticket with the Help Desk using pre-existing Slack channels.Tier 1 currently is responsible for the timely and periodic review of the Channels for new Cases; and enters all Cases manually by copying and pasting the relevant data into a new Ticket in JIRA.There is currently no method that tracks which Slack messages are Cases or have been entered in JIRA or had any action(s)There is currently no metric that measures performance, accurately, of messages involving Cases that flow through this channel.

### Portal

Users can create a new Ticket with the VA.gov CMS Help Desk (Help Desk) using the va.gov website using a form found at https://va-gov.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3 JIRA Cases are created once the User submits the form. Slack sends immediate notifications to Tier 1 upon Ticket creation. Performance of the Portal is measured with metrics and reporting is available that is accurate and is delivered monthly by the Help Desk Manager.

### Email

The address is a member of a distributed list that is hosted by va.gov.

Tier 1 is responsible for reviewing the mailbox’s incoming e-mail for any new items every 30 minutes between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. EST.

All new Cases must be manually entered into the JIRA system often by copying and pasting the related content from the email to a new Ticket in JIRA.

There currently is no performance metric that reliably and accurately reports this Support Channel.

The Help Desk is not currently tracking where this email address is being published and shared with Users.

There is currently no real-time, automated notification system to alert Tier 1 when a new Ticket is created or a User sends an email to the address.

Once a Ticket enters the Support Channels and is received by Tier 1, Tier 1 is expected to follow the expectation for the Support Channel the Ticket came through and then follow-up with the User(s) related to the Ticket with an Initial Response.

Tier 1’s Initial Response is created by using the “Reply to Customer” feature found at the bottom of the Ticket.  Initial Responses should be sent no more than 30 minutes after receiving the User’s request.  Tier 1’s Initial Response will Acknowledge the User’s issue, explain to the User that an initial assessment has been made based on the current description of the issue, ask probing questions to fully understand and align to the urgency of the User's specific situation, and Assure the Help Desk is here to help.  

## VA CMS Help Desk Responsibilities
### Tier 1

Tier 1 also provides assistance to Training both internally and externally to various requests, and to the various Feature Owners and Product Managers and their various requests as it relates to the CMS. 

Tier 1 manages the incoming Support Channel (queue) by:

Ensure that User created Tickets receive a First Response within to any new Issue between 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. EST within 30 minutes of being created.

Any In Progress Issues are being actively worked on and resolved in accordance with the time constraints related to the Ticket's Priority.

Escalate any Issue not in scope by engaging the Slack channel #cms-product-triage by sharing with the Channel the related Ticket details and soliciting feedback from the Tier 2 on-duty, Product Owners, Managers, Developers, and Engineers of the CMS.

Warm Transfer Ownership after gaining agreement on the specific Tier 2 Product Owner, or Manager, Developer, or engineer taking Lead on the Ticket, notating ownership on the Ticket.

Ensure that next-steps are taken to create Tier 2 ticket in GitHub Backlog.

Follow-up weekly with Tier 2 on the Backlog of Tickets found in GitHub and convey any progress or barriers to progress with the related User.  

Respond appropriately to follow -up on any open tickets in the Tier 1 queue.  

Ensure that any Incidents are reported/escalated immediately, and serve as Incident Commander until/unless an appropriate team member takes over that role.

Tier 2 staff consists of engineers, product owners, and developers.

The scope of their support involves all issues involving defects (critical and non-critical), feature requests, or enhancements. Additionally, Tier 2 will:

Provide Tier 1 with technical information to aid in root cause analysis.

Take ownership of Issues that fall within the scope of Tier 2.

Respond immediately to any Incident reported through the Support Channels and serve as Incident Commander as needed.

Provide 1 engineer, developer, or product owner to rotate every 2 weeks as Tier 2 on-duty providing off-hour coverage to respond to Incidents and to serve as lead on any technical questions posted to the Slack channel #cms-product-triage.

### The Help Desk Manager

Review and revise processes and procedures.

Provide stakeholders with reports related to the Help Desk’s performance.

Serve as a relationship manager between Tier 1 and Tier 2 staff.

Ensure the Help Desk is properly staffed to support forecasted Queue performance needs.

### The Delivery Manager

Prioritizes Tier 2 backlog queue and holds accountable Tier 2 rotation staff.

### Types of requests

#### User How-To or User Error Tickets

The most common Issue.

Often can be resolved with Tier 1 Enhancement or Feature Requests

Tier 1 will meet and review the Issue with Tier 2.

Tier 2 will determine if Ownership of the Issue is necessary and create a Github ticket within the backlog.

The Delivery Manager should be notified after the ticket is created schedule the request for completion in the Tier 2 Backlog

For any follow-up or clarifying questions Tier 1 may be asked to engage the User or Tier 2 may, Ownership of the Issue by Tier 2 does not necessarily remove Tier 1 from the Issue.

Tier 1 may follow-up independently of Tier 2 and notify the User of any updates until the Issue is resolved.  

### Defects

Tier 1 will escalate all Critical and Non-Critical Defects to Tier 2.  

### Content Questions

Questions related to content and the activities around how to-post that content may require assistance from VA staff.  Tier 1 should engage VA Product Owners to ensure they are aware of content related tickets by adding the Product Owner as a Participant to the JIRA Ticket.

Participants are able to add to the Conversation by replying to Ticket emails they receive and are also provided an informative view into content related Tickets involving their Staff.

## Self-Service Training for Drupal CMS Access
Drupal CMS orientation sessions contain both videos and activities that are required to be completed for access to the Drupal CMS production (live) environment.  User’s username for the production (live) environment will be created and emailed to their va.gov e-mail address when orientation activities are completed.

## Code Freeze
During Federal Holiday’s the CMS Help Desk as well as the Product engineers, developers, and owners will implement a “Code Freeze” in which no new updates to the Code or Publishing will occur.  This Freeze process may be altered with the implementation of an immediate publishing framework. 

## Release Notes
The Sprint Demo (often part of the Sprint Review ceremony in Agile/Scrum methodology) is a critical step in completing a sprint, an opportunity to excite stakeholders, and a chance for developers to show off their work.  The CMS Help Desk staff will attend Sprint Demo’s and document the various product changes and then publish those changes via Release Notes on the va.gov website (page to be determined)  and Github.

## Issues that Prevent the Publishing of Content

### Broken Links
Link-checking is part of the website's compilation or build process.  If there is a broken link, content-only deploys cannot occur.  This is because various components of the build process.  Broken Links do not block CMS deployment, broken links blocks content releases. 

## Previous Issues
### If Edit Tab Does Not Appear
Ensure that the User is added to “Public Websites” Section, editing the appropriate access to the node. 

### If a Page is Not Linking Well but Is Published Under Drupal CMS
Verify if the Node ID is correct

### What Happens if Published in Error?
Change the state of the page to “Archived”.

### Does Data Migration from TeamSites Delete Data?
The Migration doesn’t delete notes only adds or updates.

### Benefits Hub Landing Page
