## **Solution**

While evaluating the modules I came across https://www.lakedrops.com/en/blog/post/ultimate-subscription-and-notification-solution-drupal which aligns with our requirements. The rest of this document will contain details about how we implement this solution for the VA.


### **Events and Subscriptions**

Within Drupal, events are triggered from a variety of sources. The sources can include content updates, workflow changes or user changes. The DANSE (Drupal - Audit - Notification - Subscription - Event) module provides a plugin called `danse_content`, which will listen for any entity change, but there are a few downsides to the plugins. 



1. The content hooks into the entity forms instead of entity update hooks or events. https://www.drupal.org/project/danse/issues/3169702
2. No integration with `content_moderation`.

Custom plugins will need to be created to fulfill the MVP. Types of events/subscriptions needed for MVP. These plugins will be made in a way to be highly configurable and reusable.



*   Broken link integration. User will be subscribed to events, if allowed by their role, if content they author/update has broken links.
*   Content Update Subscriptions: User will be subscribed to events from content they create or edit if allowed by their role.
*   Manual Subscription: A User will be subscribed to events from content they manually subscribe to.
*   Subscribe to content/workflow events from a certain content type. 
*   Subscribe to content/workflow events from a certain content type based upon Office Taxonomy.
* UI for users to see their current subscriptions. DANSE provides a basic UI for users to turn on/off subscriptions based upon the plugins.  This will need to be evaluated to make sure itâ€™s sufficient for MVP.  Future interactions would include ability to select delivery channel per subscription.

### **Notifications**

The [push_framework](https://www.drupal.org/project/push_framework) provides a robust API for multiple delivery channels and user level control over the channels. Notifications to be sent are pulled via plugins. The pulled notifications are then sent to the channels specified by configuration (or other plugins) and queues are used to send and ensure delivery.

Plugins to be created:

*   Integration with VANotify API. This includes a new VANotify module which can either patch or fork https://www.drupal.org/project/govuk_notify.
*   A plugin to pull notifications from custom DANSE plugins mentioned above.
*   Currently templates are created either on a global or display mode for an entity.  This needs to be updated to allow notification types with different templates.

Notifications are sent out using the Advanced Queue module.  The AdvancedQueue module provides delivery ensure and retry logic.  By default, the queue runs on cron but has integrations into near realtime queueing systems.
