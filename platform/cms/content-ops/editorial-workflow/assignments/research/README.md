# Research Plan for VFS-CMS, April 2020

## Goals
This research plan is for the VFS-CMS - VFS-CMS team.

The VFS-CMS is VA.gov's content management system that provides the structured content templates, workflows and governance that help various teams at VA serve veterans accurate, accessible, up-to-date content.

Our objective for this research is to **test a proposal for a context panel in the CMS, including the actions area, editorial workflow transition and the assignments feature**. 

#### Solution Hypothesis
By consolidating available actions and workflow information in one single area, the proposed design gives more concrete context for the variety of actions that users can take with a revision in a specific stage of the editorial workflow, considering their role in the system.
* There is a more clearly defined context for editorial workflows (messages, assignments, revisions logs) will help all participants in the editorial process, including content editors, reviewers, and stakeholders.
* The ability to assign people to edit or review content will make it easier for content editors to understand the status of their content and move it through the editorial process more efficiently.
* Consolidating actions into a single area will help editors manage their content more quickly without unnecessary scrolling and surfaces all available options, so that they know what is possible.
* Additional information in the new actions area helps editors see the status of their content at a glance.

#### Research Questions
* Does the new editorial workflow design support the needs of the users?
* Do users understand how content moves back and forth in the editorial workflow?
* Do users understand that a content state can be moved to "in review" using either _assign_ or _send for review_?
* Where do users expect to find the actions that can be done with a content?
* What should assignments be used for?

#### What knowledge will make us feel like the research process has been successful?
Developing a thorough understanding of how the assignments tool serves the needs of content editors, reviewers, and stakeholders and validating design solutions in the prototype to address contextualization and actions related to the editorial workflow will show our research process has been successful.

## Method	

**What method of research are you planning?**
45-minute remote, moderated usability study with four CMS user groups. Remote observers and note takers will be in attendance.

To record the session, we'll make an initial record using verbatim notes and zoom audio and screen recording, followed by synthesized notes on our observations.

To protect PII, we will follow data management protocols outlined by [VFS-CMS research procedures](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/cms/authoring-experience/research/research-procedures).

**Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?**
This research method was chosen because we intend to validate that the proposed design is intuitive and help our users review and move content in the editorial workflow. We will guide participants through tasks using a navigational prototype to help uncover successes and pain points.

**Where are you planning to do your research?**
Online, via Zoom.

**What will you be testing?**
We will be testing a navigational prototype in Adobe XD.
