# Conversation Guide for Assignments and Editorial Workflow Usability Study

## Introduction

_(About 5 minutes)_

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Jordana, and I'm a designer and researcher for the VA.gov CMS. I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes for me. Today we're going to be testing a new way for CMS users to review and move content in the editorial workflow. During this test, I will share my screen with you and, at some point, ask you to take control of my screen, so that you can interact with the prototype.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take about 1 hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the new CMS to better meet your needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

* You'll be interacting with a prototype during this session. This means that you will be interacting with a replica of CMS, but some areas may be clickable while others aren't.

* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

_Start recording_

I want to verify that you are okay with me recording screen and audio today.


## Warm-up Questions

_(About 5 minutes)_

* How's your day going so far?

* Have you participated in usability testing before?

[If yes] How'd it go?

[If no] Ok, it's always fun to try something new. Thanks for be willing to participate in this study!


## Activity 0: Contextualization

I'll present you with some scenarios and ask you a few questions.

- What can you tell me about this content in regards to revision and editorial workflow stage?
- Can you tell me when changes were last made to this content and who made them?
- When was this content last published and who published it?
- Can you tell me who is currently responsible for working on this content?

Before we move on, do you have any questions regarding what you saw?

## Main activities

Now, I have some activities that I'd like you to do in the prototype. In each activity, you'll play the role of a fictional person and I'll let you know who you are each time. I ask you to let me know when you think you finished the activity.

#### Activity 1: Designate content to a member of your team 

In this activity you'll be _Charlie_.

Context: You're responsible for the Coronavirus FAQs page and you usually do peer revision with your team mate Billie. You just finished to adjust the content and want Billie to take a look at. Using the resources in the prototype, how would you pass the content for Billie?

#### Activity 2: Give the content to someone else to work on

In this activity you're still _Charlie_.

Context: After passing the content to Billie, you were told that they're not available to work on the Coronavirus FAQs page. In the prototype, please show me what action you would chose to pass the content to another person and why. 

#### Activity 3: Designate someone to take a look at a piece of content for approval

In this activity you'll be _Frankie_.

You finished working on the Coronavirus FAQs page and want your manager Dylan to review it before you send the final version to a stakeholder. Using the prototype, how would you request Dylan's opinion?

#### Activity 4: Send content to an external stakeholder for approval

In this activity you're still _Frankie_.

Now that Dylan gave you a green light, how would you send the content for Tracey (external stakeholder) for a final approval?


#### Activity 5: Request adjustments to a piece of content thatâ€™s in review

In this activity you'll be _Jackie_.

As Jackie, you're responsible for reviewing content from your colleagues. So now you're reviewing the Coronavirus FAQs page that Aiden sent to you and you realized that there's a typo on the page title. Using the prototype, how would you point that out to Aiden and request the necessary changes?

#### Activity 6: Publish content

In this activity you'll be _Billie_.

As Billie, can you set this Coronavirus FAQ page as ready to go live on VA.gov?

## Additional Questions

_About 3 minutes_

That concludes the task portion of this session! I have a few follow-up questions before we wrap up.

* What was your overall impression of the new way to move content through the editorial workflow?

* How could this experience have been improved for you?

* How do you see assignments improving the way you work?

* [Time to ask specific questions regarding the session].

* Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?


## Closing

_About 2 minutes_

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the new CMS experience and make sure it really works for you.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
