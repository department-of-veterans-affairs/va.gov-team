Three intersecting governance systems for the basis of content governance in VA.gov CMS. Each user in the CMS has a mix of the following assignments.

- [Content creation roles](content-creator-roles/) determine what type of content each user can create.
- [Content moderation roles](content-moderation-roles/) (Content Editor, Content Reviewer, Content Publisher) determine to which point each user can move content in the editorial workflow, from Draft -> In Review -> Approved -> Published -> Archived.
- [Sections](sections/) determine what content each user can edit, and where they can “put” content that they create.

All CMS editors are assigned a mix of these three things (with the exception of Content admins, to whom none of these rules apply).
