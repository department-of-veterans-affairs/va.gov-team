Content creator roles map 1:1 with products managed in the CMS that have content types _created_ by CMS users "in the field" (as opposed to content created by _Content Admins_, or via automated scripts, such as migration). The only permissions assigned to these roles are Content creation permission, which can be seen in this screenshot.
