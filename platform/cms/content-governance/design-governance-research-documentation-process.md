# Design Governance and Research Documentation Process for each Product
([#3340](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vagov-cms-team-5c0e7b864b5806bc2bfc2087/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/3340))

Description: CMS team needs a process for designing a content governance model for each product in the CMS. 

A content governance model includes:



*   Editorial Workflow Role Assignments (editor/reviewer/publisher)
*   User Administration Policy (who gets the keys when, and how)
*   Content Ownership (“Sections” in the CMS)
*   Content Lifecycle (from content creation through sunsetting)

A content governance model should be agile in that it is iterative, actionable and relevant. As content types and models evolve over time, so too will the governance model. 

However, the sooner we can establish an MVP governance model, the sooner we can learn and iterate on it, establishing a cadence for reviewing, updating  — and if appropriate — archiving or sunsetting content as appropriate.

**Proposed approach**

Researching - stakeholder, SME(s) and content owner via intake 



*   Intake form/process TBD (perhaps baked in to requirements doc?)
*   To be owned by CMS team (also TBD)
*   Identify what triggers research and filling out of form

Designing - based on what we  know about the content/product (high level, from intake)



*   Product goal/summary
*   Product owner(s)
*   Content stakeholder(s)
*   Content SME(s)

Documenting  - Single source of truth for each product (a.k.a. product sheet, to _include_ governance)



*   Create content playbook (focus on content lifecycle stages for each product)
*   Include product one-sheets and link to governance (maybe link from main product sheet - TBD)
*   For governance, capture for each product
    *   Editorial Workflow Role Assignments
    *   User Administration Policy
    *   Sections/content ownership
    *   Content lifecycle (from content creation through sunsetting)

**Next Steps**



1. Complete use case research / testing CLP MVP process against remaining two
2. Apply learnings about governance from all three use cases and flesh out:
    1. Overlaps (commonalities shared between products)
    2. Outliers (product specific unicorns)
    3. Gaps (what’s missing from any or all of these)
3. Create final approach, including creation of intake forms and related artifacts, and document
