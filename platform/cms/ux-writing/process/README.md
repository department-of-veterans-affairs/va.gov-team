# The how and when of UX Writing on the CMS team  

## When to involve UX writing

0. Are there words visible to CMS users in the development of a new feature or enhancement? If yes...

1. **Add the UX writing label as early as possible in planning**
- Team members add the dark red colored UX writing label to GitHub issues as a part of any of the following:
  - A spike or planned design work
  - New features or new functionality 
  - Existing functionality + planned design work 
- UX writing lead is responsible for proactively adding labels in grooming and planning sessions

2. **Break out the work**
- Label epics and stories in a way that helps plan and track the work:
  - Add an associated [UX writing task issue](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/cms-ux-writing.md) 

3. **Get clear on the context**
- A UX writer and others will start collaborating by getting clear on the following:
  - When/where users will see the changes
  - What users might need to know about the new functionality
  - Does the change need a product release note?
  - What users need to do

4. **Leave room for the writing process**
- There’s always something that can be edited, even after one produces an initial draft they feel confident about. There will almost always need to be multiple drafts for text at various stages of the work, so it’s important to:
  - Anticipate multiple iterations of the text, which may have technical or design implications.
  - Make sure the UX writer gives a final sign off on the text before it’s implemented in a prototype or in the product.
  - Editing can get messy, so the UX writer should clearly communicate what state the text is in (draft/validate/peer review/final)

5. **Give feedback**
- Peer review should always be part of the UX writing AC. Anticipate spending time giving feedback along with other members of the team.

## Working on research

- Determine if scope of research study should be expanded/restricted for UX writing discovery
- Write conversation guide questions that help draw out users language concepts
- Participate as observer in user research sessions
- Be the default note taker to ensure language is captured accurately
- Perform audit of resulting data, by doing the following:
  - Code data in reframer
  - Pull out key codes into concepts mind map (when appropriate) + Airtable database
  - Synthesize findings and document in back end style guide
