# CMS announcements

The CMS team will be putting out regular communications that help both technical and non-technical users understand how ongoing improvements to the CMS will impact their work.

See the latest announcements in the [Announcements page](https://prod.cms.va.gov/help/cms-announcements) of the Drupal CMS.

## Value of CMS announcements

- Lets Drupal CMS users know about changes that will affect their day to day work
- Gives Drupal CMS users and other stakeholders insight into where the product is headed
- Reassures everyone that we’re listening to their feedback
- Acknowledges that there are still a lot of pain points
- Celebrates the hard work our team is doing with each release
- Finds opportunities to make people smile

## What gets an announcement?

**Types of announcements**
* "New & improved" announcements - for new features or enhancements
* "Fixed it" announcements - for fixes for bugs that are annoying or noticiable, but aren't critical blockers to users' work.
* Publishing alerts - for deployment issues that impact an editor's ability to push their content live on VA.gov
* Drupal CMS outages - for when the site is totally down.
* Critical defects - for really serious bugs that block people's work.

## Editorial process

1. **Identify release note items** (*during planning*)
- [ ] Team and product manager identifies items for release notes. 

2. **Refine release note items** (*at the start of sprint*)
- [ ] UX writer tracks the status of individual release note items. 
- [ ] UX writer + product manager meet weekly (or check in in Slack) to verify the status of release note items
- [ ] PM/UX writer assigns each release note a writer. Usually this is the UX writer.

4. **Draft** (*1-2 days before release*)
- [ ] Post the drafted release note in #cms-team. Tag the product manager and teammate who worked on it. Work out any clarifications/edits in the thread, and then get 👍🏻 from PM.

8. **Publish** (*directly after release, ~ 3:30/4:00 ET*)
- Publish the Announcements page.
