# How CMS Team, UX writing, and help desk collaborate on the CMS Team

## Shared goals
The UX, CMS team, and help desk areas of the CMS project both focus on making it easier for our users to use the CMS through clear communication, helpful documentation and resources, and good design. 
These goals show up in the following activities:
