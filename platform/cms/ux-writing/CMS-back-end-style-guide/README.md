# CMS Style Guide
How to write text that improves the usability of the VA.gov content management system and communications to users. This guide helps designers make good UX writing decisions when designing parts of the CMS interface and to help promote consistency across the application. 

You might write a button label, some help text, or even a Knowledge Base article. Anything one of our users reads while using the CMS counts as UX writing and should follow the style outlined in this guide. 


There’s a lot this guide won’t cover, especially when it comes to more general determinations about style. When encountering a topic not covered here, first follow the VA.gov content style and then fall back on AP style.

**For issues not covered in this guide, default to following:**
1. [VA.gov content style guide](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/) (front-end style guide)
2. AP style
