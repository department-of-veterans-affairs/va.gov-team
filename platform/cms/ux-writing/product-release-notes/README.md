# CMS announcements

The CMS team will be putting out regular communications that help both technical and non-technical users understand how ongoing improvements to the CMS will impact their work.

- See the latest release note in the [CMS Product Release Notes Log](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/tree/master/product-release-notes)

## Background

## What gets a release note?

**Types of release notes**
* "New & improved" announcements - for new features or enhancements
* "Fixed it" announcements - for fixes for bugs that are annoying or noticiable, but aren't critical blockers to users' work.
* Publishing alerts - for deployment issues that impact an editor's ability to push their content live on VA.gov
* CMS outages - for when the site is totally down.
* Critical defects - for really serious bugs that block people's work.

## FAQs

**Q: Should the thing I'm working on be mentioned in the CMS product release notes?**

**A:** Yes, if our work will cause changes our users will notice, such as when we: 
* 🐛 Fix a bug that’s in their way
* 🎁 Add a new feature to enhance their work
* 🦆 Something in between

**Q: Excellent. So how do I become release note famous?**

**A:** Add a label and AC
* 🟥 Use the maroon colored "release notes" label
* ➕ Add the following AC: 
  - [ ] What day will your work make it to end users? As soon as you know, @ the UX writer in a comment in this issue
  - [ ] Be prepared to connect w/ UX writer for a very short (10 min or less) release notes interview about your work 

**👀 More details:**
* 🧹 It's best to identify release note items when the ticket is created, such as in planning or refinement
* 📎 Product manager and UX writer (Kevin/Oksana + Rachel) will review flagged items weekly
* ⛵️ Release notes are posted in two channels: [#cms-support](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/cms-support) and in the [Announcements and Release notes page](https://prod.cms.va.gov/help/support/release-notes) in the CMS
* 📝 The person responsible for drafting release note content defaults to the UX writer, but may be reassigned to another team member if the UX writer isn't available. 

## Editorial process

1. **Identify release note items** (*during planning*)
- [ ] Team and product manager identifies items for release notes by adding the maroon “release notes” label to issues. 

2. **Refine release note items** (*at the start of sprint*)
- [ ] UX writer tracks the status of individual release note items in the Editorial calendar. 
- [ ] UX writer + product manager meet weekly (or check in in Slack) to verify the status of release note items
- [ ] PM/UX writer assigns each release note a writer. Usually this is the UX writer.

4. **Draft** (*1-2 days before release*)
- [ ] If you're new to writing release notes, review this guide (TK)
- [ ] Use this template to draft the release note content in the [AT release note log](https://airtable.com/tblulo3XrMLuh4N0l/viwL2poNtFAZMeS6Z?blocks=hide). 
- [ ] Post the drafted release note in #cms-team. Tag the product manager and teammate who worked on it. Work out any clarifications/edits in the thread, and then get 👍🏻 from PM.

8. **Publish** (*directly after release, ~ 3:30/4:00 ET*)
