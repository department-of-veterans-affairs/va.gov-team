# Product release notes

The CMS team will be putting out regular communications that help both technical and non-technical users understand how ongoing improvements to the CMS will impact their work.

- See the latest release note in the [CMS Product Release Notes Log](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/tree/master/product-release-notes)

## Background

**😣 Pain points of old release notes**

- Not readable by non-technical people
- Not visible anywhere except on GitHub
- No notifications
- Nothing about why, audience affected, etc.

**🍩 Value of new, user-friendly release notes**

- Lets CMS users know about changes that will affect their day to day work
- Gives CMS users and other stakeholders insight into where the product is headed
- Reassures everyone that we’re listening to their feedback
- Acknowledges that there are still a lot of pain points
- Celebrates the hard work our team is doing with each release
- Finds opportunities to make people smile

## What gets a release note?

**Q: Should the thing I'm working on be mentioned in the CMS product release notes?**

**A:** Yes, if our work will cause changes our users will notice, such as when we: 
* 🐛 Fix a bug that’s in their way
* 🎁 Add a new feature to enhance their work
* 🦆 Something in between

**Q: Excellent. So how do I become release note famous?**

**A:** Add a label and AC
* 🟥 Use the maroon colored "release notes" label
* ➕ Add the following AC: 
  - [ ] What day will your work make it to end users? As soon as you know, @ the UX writer in a comment in this issue
  - [ ] Connect w/ UX writer for a very short (10 min or less) release notes interview about your work 

**👀 More details:**
* 🧹 Best done right when the ticket is created, such as in planning or grooming
* 📎 Product manager and UX writer (Kevin + Rachel) will review flagged items weekly
* 💎 UX writer may follow up for details after item is demoed
* ⛵️ Release notes are posted in [#cms-support](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/cms-support)

## Editorial process

1. Team and product manager identifies items for release notes during grooming and demo by adding the maroon “release notes” label to tickets
2. UX writer tracks the status of individual release note items in the Editorial calendar
3. UX writer + product manager meet weekly to verify the status of release note items
4. Draft the release note in the [AT release note log](https://airtable.com/tblulo3XrMLuh4N0l/viwL2poNtFAZMeS6Z?blocks=hide)
5. Ask the person who did the work to review their item by adding the text to their ticket and @ing them.
6. Review entire release note with product manager and get approval
7. Migrate content into markdown file in va.gov-cms/product-release-notes using a correct naming convention
8. Post in Slack: @here in [#cms-support](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/cms-support)
