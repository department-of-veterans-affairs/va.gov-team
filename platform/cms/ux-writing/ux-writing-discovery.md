# UX writing discovery

Mapping **language and vocabularies** to **personas**, **journeys**, and **workflows** that are validated by **research** and documented and intentegrated into CMS **governance** and **design patterns**.

## Language audits

*Looking at legacy research and the current CMS to understand what language patterns currently exist.* 

**Helps us understand**

- What kind of feedback have we already received from cms users? What workflows are difficult?

- What is the baseline / “before” picture of language context in the cms and how is it impacting usability?

**Vocabulary**

- Technical: Drupal
- Technical: web
- plain language
- org familiar
- abstract technical

**Voice and tone**

- point of view (first, second, third person)
- directive (authoritative)
- directive (helpful)

## User research

*What language do CMS users employ to describe their own work?*

- *What kind of context do users need so they can understand language they encounter in the CMS, without relying on external support?*
- *What words are familiar or difficult for each user?*

**Methods**

- Highligher testing (*What words make users feel more or less confident?*)
- Card sorts (*Terms I understand fully/ terms I'm not sure about / terms I don't understand*)
- Log analysis (*What language are users employing to describe their work and problems with the CMS?*)
- CMS training observation (*what kinds of help/feedback are users requesting?*)


**Grammar**

- parallel structure

## Personas, journey mapping, workflows

*Understanding how vocabularies map to different personas and Drupal user roles*

**CMS user experience**

*If the CMS was a customer support agent, how would we rate its conversational skills? How does the conversation need to change with different kinds of users?*

- familiarity
- relevance
- ease
- clarity
- consistency

## Back end style guide

*What kinds of rules do we need to establish or further define to ensure consistency?*
