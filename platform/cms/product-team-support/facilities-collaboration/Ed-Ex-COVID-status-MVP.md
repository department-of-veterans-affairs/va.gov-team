# Editorial experience for the COVID status (MVP)

Date: May 6, 2022 

Attendees: Cindy Terdiman, Danielle Thierry, Erika Washburn, Rachel Kauff

## Notes
- We may want to share with VHA partners to ensure that we are on the right track/same page
- Masks will be required regardless of the level
- Inline FE guidance/details from prototype is a good next iteration
- Messages can be in the KB article
   - KB can contain all sorts of context or just procedural
- Editors need to know statuses at their facility and someone will be telling them
- Every Friday facilities will determine their status, they will also have different signage to put up saying these same things, then there’s an employee component that we don’t need to worry about. This is every Friday and if it changes they should update on Fridays.
   - Danielle will let us know if the reporting cadence changes from weekly
- COVID or COVID-19? 
   - Confirm with Swirt if there’s a database reason to write the title
- Status can be “low, medium, high”, without “covid” 
- There may be complications between operating status and covid status
- Covid may require closures that could warrant some conditional logic
- We need content model and tech understanding for this issue


Operating status iteration:
   - Context for “do not use this section for Covid/masks” in help text
   - Github issue for guidance on helptext, give issue to Danielle to help build out
- FE is “COVID-19 Safety Guidelines”
- PAO testing ASAP
   - Need help text feedback, less about the UI



## Action items
- Share KB article link with Danielle
- Ask about how the dropdown is updated and if it is an easy fix. Does it automatically get updated with changes to the taxonomy
- Danielle will give low, medium, high guidance
- KB article updates on operating status
- Change management emails that detail KB articles
- Convert notes in GH markup
