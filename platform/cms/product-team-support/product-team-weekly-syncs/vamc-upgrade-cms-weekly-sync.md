## Friday Apr 8

Training
  * Policies page training
    * Jane: Dave and I met on Zoom to discuss Policies training, so we're good on that - we can take it off the agenda to make room for other items. I'll have the Policies training slides updated tomorrow and then get them recorded, captioned and posted in CMS help center early next week.
    * How might we make this more "plug and play" for future Top Task pages? **Kev to review with this in mind** 
  * Tuesday meeting with everyone who has done training (65 so far)
    * Jane and Josh attending.
* Help desk triage between teams
  * If help desk user doesn't respond after 3 asks, we close out issue.
  * Jira access is working well 
* Do we have a help desk satisfaction measure?
  * It's great if triage is working for us, how is it working for the field?
  * Two loud voices, one from VISN 4, satisfied - anecdotal.
  * CMS team will add a backlog item around measuring help desk satisfaction  
* Dual state launches progress and upcoming
  * Went well this week.
  * 4 next week and weeks following, including some big ones (20 facilities)
* Go-live timeline (eg for Erie)
  * VHA will be validating 8 times a day publishing in writing to turn off Teamsite
  * 60 day (or 30-day) countdown will begin once an update is added to carousel on legacy pages (eg https://www.erie.va.gov/)
  * this 60 day period may start next Thursday (end of May)
  * Start with 1 in a sprint or week, then scale up to the current pace of dual state (3-4 per week)
* Mobile, Domiciliary and Community Living Center facilities don't work in current product
  * blocking launch for any VAMCs that have these facilities (eg Philadelphia which has a domiciliary)
* CMS account flows 
  * PAOs can request accounts that are lesser or equal to theirs 

## Friday Mar 26

* CMS help desk triage - feedback and discussion.
  * Escalation paths, prevent request loops, what can we do better?
  * 22 users from first seven VISNs are in the system. 
  * How can we prevent "loops"
    * Stan: eg Stan referred Nate to help desk and help desk referred Nate to Stan. 
    * Dave: What's the data like? Is this CMS related or is it "how do i use this product"? 
      * Stan's team has larger capacity to teach the content intent and collect the data for the product team.
    * Clarence: main source of pain are a few users.
    * Stan: if it's a content question, send it to VAMC upgrade. If it's technical, CMS team eg "can't find this, how do i get to this". VAMC upgrade team will host a Q&A in a couple weeks for VAMC editors who have completed their training.
    * Vanessa: Proposed process for CMS help desk referring an issue to VAMC upgrade team: add Stan as a participant on Jira ticket. At that point Stan can respond via email to those Jira issues.
    * Can we add the participant field to the #cms-helpdesk-bot, then Stan can set up a notification for that channel when he is mentioned. 
* Dual-state: VISN 16!
  * Deployment schedule next week: 3 for Tuesday March 30. 3 for Wednesday.  
  * Eastern colorado- Steve and Kevin to try to reproduce on Tugboat today (may be an update next week)
* Content being published before Dual State (eg Houston content published before Houston is in dual state)
  * Stan will have source of truth pinned to VAMC upgrade channel. [This list](https://prod.cms.va.gov/admin/content?title=&type=health_care_region_page&moderation_state=editorial-published&owner=All) also shows VAMC systems that are published, which is an imperfect proxy for dual state. 
  * Next week: Talk about opportunities to remove publishing until Dual State. Kev to set something up. 
* Policies page announcement for training and change management (may be too soon to discuss, depends on FE) 
  * Jane has slacked slidedeck to Dave for review with a few questions 
  * Recording can happen next sprint. 
  * Existing FE Policies pages can be used in training materials.  
  * Delivery of training and other change management is dependent on FE (which is blocked by a CMS issue). 

## Friday Mar 19 10:30am ET

* CMS help desk triage - feedback on the last week.
  * triage channel working so far for content and user questions
  * Vanessa will look at adding Stan to Jira
* Policies page cutover runbook - which team will create these pages and populate them, and when. 
  * No announcement from users until FE work is done. 
  * Existing Dual State sites: VHA will send out announcement to users, possibly JHL or from her office.
* Problem statement: What is the best solution to create the Program & Research, top level pages for each systems, but not publish.
  * Place for PAO to place pages at a lower level after the menus and other pages are locked down.
  * If they don't have those areas now, how best do we create these areas? (Create and keep them disabled in Menu? Keep them in Draft?)
  * Possible solution: 
    * create a Programs template page that can be cloned, and a Research template page can be cloned. 
    * Add disabled menu items for each
    * Add some explainer / placeholder text with instructions. Eg: Edit this page and enable menu item. Add children "Detail page" content if this page is not enough. 
* The use of placeholder images for facilities and stories. (covered on March 18)
* Dual state schedule for next week. 

## Friday Mar 12 10:30am ET

1. VAMC user administration - Roles, timing and responsibility for unblocking new VAMC users on prod.  
  * Stan emails list of users for next training.
  * VAMC editors are added as blocked to prod, but training happens in training environment
  * Stan continues to communicate with VAMC editors about content
  * We've gone back and forth on who should unblock them on prod. But to lighten load on Stan, Stan should open jira issue to unblock editors on prod.
3. VAMC user help requests - Triage process for VAMC users help requests.
  * When CMS help desk gets VAMC user issue, we will triage via slack for now, and develop this process in coming weeks. 
5. Dual state launch planning and updates. 
  * Cheyenne, Montana, Eastern Colorado next Tuesday, finishes out VISN 19. Stan will send out updates.
  * Asheville, Durham on Wednesday, to start VISN 6.
  * Thursday AM for anything remaining. 
7. VAMC System Policies Page 
  * Content will need to be added, one for each VAMC system.
  * Change management with existing VAMC users. 
    * See who last updated Policies pages for their 
  * CMS team will manage the cutover when we're ready to go

@todo
- New issue: as an anonymous user, i can get to help docs from home page or login page.
- Recreate training videos to remove vacmssupport email address
- node id reerences to the old Policies page will need to be updated to use the new one.

### Other? 
 
## Wednesday Dec 9 2:30pm ET

### How we work

1. How we work (Kevin)
1. Training - 10 min (Jane)
   1. Report back: 9 trainees. 2 no shows. 
   1. Request Facility info change link and expected turnaround time - https://vaww.va.gov/WEBCOM/VAMC_Facility_Location_Updates.asp
     - This is a question for VHA Digital Media - they make the updates to VAST, how quickly is that processed?
     - They can also contact the VISN administrator, or escalate to VHA Digital Media. 
     - CMS backlog issue to put this in the CMS UI https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/3678 
   1. Should there be a character limit on system banner alerts?
     - This will be coming, but not ready to pull trigger on this. 
1. User administration (Jane) 
- This may be a hot topic for the Spring, governance, data integrity.
1. VHA meeting Dec 9 agenda (Kevin/Jane) - move offline
1. Dual state and product launches - 5 min (Stan)
1. Vaccine content for Facility API (Dave)
 - New taxonomy term coming into VHA health service: "COVID 19 Vaccines" 
 - JHL is adding it, probably to Specialty Care
 - Trying to create a system of record about what facilities are offering one or more of the vaccines. Content will be produced and maintained in Drupal source of truth, available through Lighthouse.
 - Multiple ways to approach this... 
 - What's the data? 
 - Can the current content model support this? Seems like yes. 
 - Push to Lighthouse - we have a similar pattern for facility pushes that we could use, but this would be services. 
 - Need to get the content in? 
 
 
Next steps: Kev and Swirt will meet at 4:30pm to talk through the data and migration problem. 
 
1. Migration (Steve)
1. VAMC Scaffolding (Kevin/Steve)
