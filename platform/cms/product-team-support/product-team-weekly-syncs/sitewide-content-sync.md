### Content priorities for VA team
- Establish baseline metrics (Danielle)
- **Hubs:** How are the hubs performing? How we are going to base success? I’ve been looking at Hubs: digging into funnels, paths, etc. Ongoing comprehension testing.
- **Structured content:** talking about chatbot where content is scraped from Drupal. Don’t want to have to rewrite content.
- **Single source of truth:** What belongs where: where does content belong (benefits vs Resources & Support)
- **Roles:** why was CMS team brought on? Strategy sat with us before. We’ve been in react mode up to now. (Beth)
- **Taxonomy:**...Health services taxonomy that has things other than services. Taxonomy is a foundational organizing principle for all the products. (Kevin)
- **Quality:** once we have more authors, how do we retain quality? Some have content backgrounds, others don’t. We use checklists of basics before articles get published. There’s room for collaboration on templates for types of articles. Example: “squishy template”. Is it guidance or planning or review?
...Suzanne: are you measuring good content? Beth: no but use the checklist. Next step is to quantify the quality of the product (used internally by content team).We haven’t used these lists with the Vet Centers.
- **Templates:** Beth: we were guinea pigs for CMS and ran into constraints like character counts so we have experience of creating articles using the templates. Tried to use multiple FAQ but there were character count. Would there be a review process to help author use correct template? Learn the challenges faced by new authors.
- **Governance:** doing a pilot with VHA to start working through what a planning group would look like (Beth)
...Kevin: we do need to figure out governance structure
- **Translation:** new law passed. Danielle represents this team.
- **Training for authors**
...Community of practice for authors (MFA style model): to get ready for Resources
- **Workflow:** Beth: we may need an override for authors who are not content designers
- **FAQs** - Danielle: we were not involved in R&S that uses FAQs. 
Danielle: Bring Mickey into this conversation. Denise to add Mikki Northuis (IA) to invite
...sounds like we’re in same place, with thinking about foundational issues.

  * Might want to start with a content audit, similar to the audit that was recently done for the right rail
    * Helptext: may be waiting for Design System work, but what might be blocking?
    * Q4 goal was to align on table guidance, but CMS hasn’t gotten to it yet

    * Has there been any research done around this to date? And if so how can CMS Content get access?
  * Components that are being used across multiple products, how do we coordinate across all the various stakeholders? To keep eyes on change management
    * VAMC product as an example where accordions have been leveraged heavily
    * When to use guidance rather than rules, when to lock down in the CMS versus heavily discourage yet allow
    * Currently 30 content types and only 3 that allow editors to go freestyle
