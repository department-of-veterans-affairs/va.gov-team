### Meeting Notes

#### Claro (Rachel Kauff)
- Launch set for 3:30 pm ET, February 22
- 20 people have tried demo environment out of 800 as of Feb. 16
- Developer login was confusing people, which is good! The design intention to have editors use PIV is working
- We have a backlog item to remove PIV on lower environments to remove confusion (no decision)
- Site alert is up on prod with link to KB article
- Will have survey up for several weeks after launch

#### Recurring events (Rachel Kauff)
- Launch set for March 1
- Email announcement as the feature is being launched with feedback survey and link to KB article
- Can’t use login page alert because Vet Centers will see it

#### Top tasks (Suzanne Gray)
**DECISION: Changing launch date to March 15** on the CMS Sitewide team timeline but actual launch could be later in March
- Facilities FE work may impact timeline and move us out a sprint
- Suzanne will follow-up to get FE dependency details

Editor Work effort: 1 hour or less per healthcare system to move it to new pages
Deadline to complete the top task work: 30 days out from launch (agreed as an experiment)

Dave: future work required of editors may require more effort and would have different timeframes

- draft reminder emails to all VAMCs and for dry run
- send emails to VAMC editors, VISNs
- manage VHA Editors mailing list
- announcing in PAO Newsletter (weekly either Monday or Wednesday)
