### Meeting Notes

Top Tasks
Editors can control everything now, including React widgets, which is overwhelming. We're moving from "junk drawer" pages to more structured content. A lot of this content was cloned so a mixed bag of best practices that reflect snapshots in time of content design practice. For most VAMCs, this should be seamless. Same URl. Content is the same. 
What's different: more structured hours and location information 
Gray boxes suggest what you can't edit. Dave:
- adding gray boxes has front end, back end, change management and IA/usability considerations
- what problem are we tryig to solve is part of this process
- goal is to do more of these on pages like suicide prevention and womens health to avoid duplicated content
Dave: Phone number missing extension? ==> TURN ON OPTION WITH EXTENSION
Potential confusion between editing a loation with multiple pay offices and adding a facility
- in many cases can use existing address, hours and phone system level info
- at publish, it will unpublish the old page and use that URL for the new content

#### Claro (Rachel Kauff)
- Launch set for 3:30 pm ET, February 22

#### Top tasks (Suzanne Gray)

- Facilities FE work may impact timeline and move us out a sprint
- Suzanne will follow-up to get FE dependency details
