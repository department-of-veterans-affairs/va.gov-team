#### Claro (Rachel Kauff)
- Launch set for 3:30 pm ET, February 22
- 20 people have tried demo environment out of 800 as of Feb. 16

- Will have survey up for several weeks after launch

#### Recurring events (Rachel Kauff)
- Launch set for March 1
- Email announcement as the feature is being launched with feedback survey and link to KB article
- Canâ€™t use login page alert because Vet Centers will see it

#### Top tasks (Suzanne Gray)
**DECISION: Changing launch date to March 15** on the CMS Sitewide team timeline but actual launch could be later in March
- Facilities FE work may impact timeline and move us out a sprint
- Suzanne will follow-up to get FE dependency details
