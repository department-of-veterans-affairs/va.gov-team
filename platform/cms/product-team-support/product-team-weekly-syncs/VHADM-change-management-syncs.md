### Meeting Notes

Top Tasks
Editors can control everything now, including React widgets, which is overwhelming. We're moving from "junk drawer" pages to more structured content. A lot of this content was cloned so a mixed bag of best practices that reflect snapshots in time of content design practice. For most VAMCs, this should be seamless. Same URl. Content is the same. 
What's different: more structured hours and location information 
Gray boxes suggest what you can't edit. Dave:
- adding gray boxes has front end, back end, change management and IA/usability considerations
- what problem are we tryig to solve is part of this process
- goal is to do more of these on pages like suicide prevention and womens health to avoid duplicated content
- I do want to harden as much content as possible
- Kev: hardening does take coordination but it can be added fairly easily, particulalrly to existing centralized content
- During launch we will publish 139 pages in prod. You can see which locations have edited this content.
Dave: Phone number missing extension? ==> TURN ON OPTION WITH EXTENSION
Potential confusion between editing a loation with multiple pay offices and adding a facility
- in many cases can use existing address, hours and phone system level info
- at publish, it will unpublish the old page and use that URL for the new content

Top tasks - blueprint (user journey)
We'll share with VHA DM
Added the dry run and beta test phase
VHA creating email and we are editing it
- we provide a summary of what is changing, why and what it means to a VHA editor (elevator version) ==> ASAP
- liked the Claro version
- We'll be creating their pages for the beta users manually
- mailing list: have Outlook group VA CMS but concerned that it will get outdated so CMS team can generate a CSV file
- eventually there will be a "secret" link that VHADM can access to get the csv on demand
- Community of Practice: discussed with Jenny who wants to deliberate further on process and roles
- User group idea: Dave would like to discuss pros and cons
- Beta test the user support process: Jeff thinks yes
- Jeff: How much change can we manage and editors experience?
 - Dave: we're being congnizant of what we are asking and why and how frequently
 - The why is key
 - Why is this task valuable for example? We're taking that responsibility for this content off their shoulder.

AIR released March 3: realignment of facilities proposal
- PAOs will be dealing with lots of inquiries
- when facilities close down we'll need to know the comms planning
- will need appropriations

### Meeting Notes

#### Claro (Rachel Kauff)
- Launch set for 3:30 pm ET, February 22
- 20 people have tried demo environment out of 800 as of Feb. 16
- Developer login was confusing people, which is good! The design intention to have editors use PIV is working
- We have a backlog item to remove PIV on lower environments to remove confusion (no decision)
- Site alert is up on prod with link to KB article
- Will have survey up for several weeks after launch

#### Recurring events (Rachel Kauff)
- Launch set for March 1
- Email announcement as the feature is being launched with feedback survey and link to KB article
- Canâ€™t use login page alert because Vet Centers will see it

#### Top tasks (Suzanne Gray)
**DECISION: Changing launch date to March 15** on the CMS Sitewide team timeline but actual launch could be later in March
- Facilities FE work may impact timeline and move us out a sprint
- Suzanne will follow-up to get FE dependency details

Editor Work effort: 1 hour or less per healthcare system to move it to new pages
Deadline to complete the top task work: 30 days out from launch (agreed as an experiment)

Dave: future work required of editors may require more effort and would have different timeframes

- send emails to VAMC editors, VISNs
