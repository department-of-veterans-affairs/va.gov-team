## Wednesday February 17

 * CLP alpha user review (John and Randi's comments) - [See google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gUTTX0-8Cm-nBVQ5CI_k15bgqSXHpGNm/edit)
 * CLP beta user onboarding (any updates)

## Wednesday February 10

### CLP

- CLP Start to finish
  - John shared [this graphic](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C52CL1PKQ/p1612966331368900?thread_ts=1612965801.368000&cid=C52CL1PKQ)t
  - The request form will contain context about the purpose (and constraints!) of a CLP. 
  - A how to video?
  - John's estimate is max 12 CLPs per year (but probably less, 8-10?)
  - Where do Training / guides fit into this? 
- Character count on Benefits detail page intro field


Covered Feb 9 asynchronously / on call about content model doc

- Any further feedback on Content model changes documentation? 
- Any more FE or Content support needed for CLP? 
  - Eg: Video bundle now has field_publication_date for CLP
- Past events (for Outreach hub)
  - CMS team will build a tool to manually archive past events on prod, but this may not make it into next sprint ([4212](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/4212)).  After that, we'll go ahead and archive past outreach events, and let that team know ([#4213](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/4213))
  - CMS team will initiate a spike [4214](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/4214) into how best to manage past events across CMS in an automatic way, and we will need product-specific feedback. 

## Wednesday February 3

- Help text for "Add a link to an external blog or other list of stories" field clarification

  - ongoing asynchronous is working
  - two main concerns: 1) designs are very custom, not much design system, lots of custom CSS. 2) Accessibility audit ongoing. 
- Test users update from John
  - VBA and VHA, meetings ongoing with Randi and John
  - nothing ready in Feburary (use Teamsite for now)
  - After Kelson finishes FE and CMS team finishes with backend, Randi and John will rebuild test. 
  - Test users will prototype alphas in second half of February, hopefully. 
  - We'll figure out how the keys are given, and the "managed experience".

### Resources & support
- Any updates?

### Benefits detail pages

- CMS technical debt: Intro text refactor #939

## Wednesday January 6 10am ET

  - 3924 Max 2 related benefits (needs refining)
  - 3926 Broken link checker false positive (8 pts)

- Questions from Public Website Team: 
  - What FE actions (if any) are needed to build accordions FAQâ€™s?: determined to be handled by PW team

  - Is layout/view already mobile capable or will a mobile version needed to be considered during FE build?: determined to be handled by PW team

  - What are the 508 & a11y considerations? (Previous discussions/findings?): determined to be handled by PW team

  - Have we consider CTA tracking and analytics per campaign i.e. how do we make this turnkey for analytics tracking requests/reviews.: determined to be handled by PW team and PO

  - What is the current planned "governance" considerations? What should be considered/known as we build FE elements?: determined to be handled by PW team and PO

### Resources & support

- What's left?: all major functionality has been built with the exception of videos, which will be revisited after the February Drupal update

### Benefits detail pages

- Tech debt: swapping out `field_intro_text` with `field_intro_text_limited_html`
  - Background: the old intro text field allows html that it shouldn't. Tech debt from the original Benefits Hub build. CMS team did half the work to fix this in Q2 2020. Would like to finish this out. 
    - Content with invalid html (tocs and buttons) was moved December 30 to appropriate places in the content. #3903 (basically done)
    - next steps: FE template should use the new field. CMS team can handle the liquid template, but not the transformer. #1166 (quick template work, but will require transformer adjustment).
    - Then CMS team can remove the old field from CMS, and the script that copies each edit over to new field. (#1421)
- CMS team to communicate through PW intake process.
