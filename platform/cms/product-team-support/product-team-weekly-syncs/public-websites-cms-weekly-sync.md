## October 6

[Dave out]

Amandeep's role on FE

Promos
* PW is a couple weeks out from being able to work on them

React-only, mobile only pages (?) and banners visibility settings (slack threads from yesterday)
* Full width banners are appearing on some pages where they shouldn't, like the mobile checkin
* React apps use client-side routing. 
* We don't have granularity for mini-routes in react apps, but as far as we know that's not needed.
* We've removed trailing slash on the banner path setting which will  solve the immediate problem, because these pages are not /index.html pages. 
* Another FE PR by Kelson will address 

Staging.va.gov has CMS data that dates back to 3am ET. 
* In Tugboat we can manually rebuild the prod mirror on demand. 
* When staging.va.gov rebuilds (on every merge), it does a new content build 

Action links in rich text 
* CMS is looking to support these in Rich text editors for PW/Sitewide content team products 

[#6603 Defect affecting generation of Unique IDs for h2s and h3s](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/6603)






## September 29

Veterans Day - VEO or other needs

Gov shutdown content needs
 * Evolving situation, contingency plan regularly being updated. As of now:
   * VHA will continue operations
   * VBA, OPIA, OIT (including OCTO, and Dave) TBD, may be furloughed. Last time it lasted 2 hours. 
 * Off-cycle deploy authority will be delegated to Andrea H and Michal F. 
 * Be mindful of deploy risks, extra extra care to avoid off cycle releases.

Promo banners 
 * How might we 
    * get these into the CMS as they stand now.
      * support all types of promos from design system.
    * find overlap/differences with sitewide banners (content model, governance, scope, editorial experience)
    * discovery on governance strategy
      * possibly support promos within other products (VAMC)
      * guard against whack-a-mole / banner takeover of the page. Eg VA Pittsburgh has a Pittsburgh-specific promo banner, and there's another promo banner that pops up. 
      * silo promo banners by product, directory, etc.
      * set content guidelines/guardrails.
    * CMS team to to set up 
      *  


## September 22

CMS team and staffing changes
- Previously: CMS Product Support team
- Currently: **Sitewide CMS team**
- Future: Sitewide CMS - Product support team

Banners
- Timeline on [#28924](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/28924) and [#6176](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/6176)
- Outcome of call with Sitewide content team Sept 17--they are aware of OPIA banner node and will be considering governance issues w/r/t banners and paths. 
- Intake request form - Brian and Dave will discuss what to do with it, since Promo is still a thing. Doesn't cover modals. 
- Dave/Steve/Kev - path field visibility.


## September 15

Alert banners (soon to be FKA "Banners")
- High five session 
- Update from OPIA handoff yesterday (covered in Jane's email, forwarded to Brian and Kelson)
- Next steps to remove alert block cruft [from FE](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/28924) and [CMS](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/6176) (PR ready)
- This Friday's meeting with Sitewide content team

Promo banners
- Current state - how does this work? 
  - In vets-website there's a folder called Announcements, with a [index.jsx config file](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/master/src/platform/site-wide/announcements/index.jsx), where announcements can be added with a custom component that renders as a promo banner. 
  - [There are different types of promo banners](https://design.va.gov/components/promo-banners) (benefits announcements, news, signup)
  - If the text is too long, the design breaks. 
  - Currently supported on any URLs. 
  - The intention with the Afghanistan promo banner was to have it on all pages, but there's a defect (no timeline)
  - Promo banners have largely served as pressure release valves for other product requests, such as adding "Afghanistan resources" to the main nav. 
- User stories for PW team
  - Dave's MVP idea: Just on the homepage, or all pages.  It 
  - Dave: Is this a place for planned downtime announcements? PW will investigate.
- Possibility of extending this tool to VAMCs, but this brings governance issues
  - But each URL can only have one, so there are cross-product governance details to work out. Who trumps who? 
  - What happens if user dismisses the "top" promo banner, does another one show up? 
  - How might the design system support some of these governance needs. 
- Should promo banners expire? Maybe not an MVP feature but this could help with governance. 

## September 8

Banners blocker to launch
- CMS finishing two blockers required for OPIA 
  - https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/6175 
  - https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/6015

## September 1

Banners runbook

Recurring events knowledge transfer for design - who should be there

## Aug 25

**Recurring events**
* Design work needed around workflow, UX (from both listing page and detail page)
  * Loop in Mikki
  * Loop in Facilities team to ensure UX is coordinated across the CMS
* Can we get a list of all events and urls in the system? to see how many have been cloned **CMS to do**

**Banners**
* Currently on all non-prod environments
* CMS to update content to provide parity on all sites **CMS to do**
* PW to ensure banner component is reusable **PW to do**
  * Projecting to have in non-prod soon (latest ~early next week, dependent on review process)
* CMS to sync with Danielle on pathing (include Dave) **CMS to do**
  * OPIA should only have access to homepage alert
  * May need some editorial experience changes in order to only show what's relevant to OPIA (question for Danielle)
* Dismiss functionality: may want an expiry for dismissal (e.g. promo banner has been in use since ~Sept?, dismissed and forgotten about)
  * Does this need separate UX and governance?
  * Homepage update coming soon
  * If moving from local storage to session storage, shouldn't be a big lift for PW
* Governance around changing paths when not supposed to (not a blocker)

**Breadcrumbs**
* PR to fix hyphenation should be in by COB today
* Will wait for Kev to return to connect dots


## Aug 18

**Recurring events for Outreach Hub and VAMC**

Drupal
* One event node (entity) for many events
* Editors will be able to override individual event instances (cancel etc)
* GraphQL demo https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/6055

FE TBD 
* One node, many single pages
  * How to handle scaleability -- limits on number of instances
  * What is the right design for repeating events - one page with all instances or one page per instance
  * ICS calendar link feasibility for repeating events - 
  * What is the right URL for event pages
* Event listing page refactoring
* Preview experience
* PW team will design/research next steps here


**Banners**

* Content type close to ready, still working on governance features
* Scope
  * Non-content admins cannot create banners, but they can edit them. 
  * Non-content admins will not be able to edit 
  * PR open to support exceptions, catch alls, info and warning
* Governance
  * Punting on stacking and sorting issues for now, can be handled by business process by sitewide content team, who needs awareness. 
* Runbook for sunsetting block 42 (vaccine) 
  * Finish creating new node and scope (Steve and Randi/Danielle, need to confirm the visibility rules) 
  * Will we support both banner types at once? 
  * Testing the switch in a tugboat environment with Kelson's branch?  (archive block 42 + publish the new node, test the paths to see that they match prod), test the homepage banner. 
  * Merge Kelson's PR
  * Confirm the visibility rules with sitewide team. 
  * Repeat the launch on prod 
  * Then remove FE support for alert-block-based banners.
  * Then remove CMS support for alert-block-based banners.  
  * **CMS** issues for editorial experience - clear rules about what banners are for 
  * **CMS** issue to trigger content build

## August 11

**Banners**
* [rubric](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/banners/Banner-Alert%20Rubric.md) from discussions with John/Dave/Jen in 2020 is hypothetical, needs more discussion with design system and thinking across products and teams
 * none of this is critical path for this phase 
* Query to pull in in has a POC
* Dismissibility
  * CMS team will be adding a dismissability field soon, defaulting to true
  * same behavior from the existing block/42 dismissibility
  * What happens to a dismissable banner after it's edited? 
  * FE could use revision ID to reset, for now. Or a hash. 
  * Iteration could consider adding additional tools for dismissability settings, based on data from Veterans.  
* Stacking 
 * Current state is OK for now, can be handled by business process with teams managing banners.
 * governance for stacking probably can't be on the CMS side
* Existing VAMC (`full_width_banner_alerts`) should continue to work as is for now, could possibly be moved to `banners` in the future. 
* path scope problem
  * Needs to be agnostic to the CMS (like the homepage)
  * Need a clear regex pattern, like asterisk at the tail end, which is what sitewide content team needs to migrate block/42 to new content type. 
  * `!` at the start of a string for path blocking. 
  * Nice to have: being able to regex the asterisk anywhere in the path, like `/*-health-care/*` for any health care site, or for any events, like `*/events/*`. 

**Recurring events**
* To be discussed with Michelle present week of the 16th.


## August 4
