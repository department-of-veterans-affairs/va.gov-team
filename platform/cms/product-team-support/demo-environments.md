**_This will soon be deprecated, as we move from DevShop to Tugboat for demo environments_**

Product teams can use demo environments for the following four user stories (and potentially others that we haven't yet thought of!). These user stories are covered in a training that we can provide to product teams. 

* [Training PDF](VACMS-product-demo-environments-training.pdf)
* [Training video](https://civicactions.zoom.us/rec/play/tZx8Ibiv_Gg3E4GTuASDBPV8W9S-LKmshHUdqfoPzxy3VyZWNQelYLEXMeqN3bJNuP9b0soCiW0qxrTq?startTime=1589828820000) (Password: 8x?Hf980)

## User story 1

As a member of a product team, I want a version of www.va.gov where your productâ€™s draft content can be published, so that you can then send it to stakeholders (peers, platform team, or others) for review. Note that these demo environments are _not_ available on copmuters outside the VA network, so it is not a recommended approach for end user testing. 

### User story 1b (not covered in slidedeck or video)

As a member of a product team, i want to create my own demo site, and not rely on CMS team. 

1) Go to http://devshop.cms.va.gov/node/add/site/demo 
2) Login using the Github logo
3) Provide the name for your environment. A name like `philadelphiahealthcare` will yield two environments: 

 - CMS http://philadelphiahealthcare.demo.ci.cms.va.gov/
 - Web http://philadelphiahealthcare.web.demo.ci.cms.va.gov/

## User story 2

As a member of a product team, I want a content sandbox so that you can experiment, and make and preview content changes without worrying about impact on production environments. 

## User story 3

As a user of a demo or sandbox environment, I want to refresh it with the latest content from production, for additional review or experimentation.

## User story 4

As a member of a product team wanting to test content changes along with unmerged VACMS or vets-website code changes, I want an environment where i can work with CMS and vets-website branches other than main.
 * Scenario 1: VACMS main and vets-website feature branch
 * Scenario 2: VACMS feature branch and vets-website feature branch
