Product teams can use demo environments for the following four user stories (and potentially others that we haven't yet thought of!). These user stories are covered in a training that we can provide to product teams.

## User story 1

As a member of a product team, I want a version of www.va.gov where your productâ€™s draft content can be published, so that you can then send it to stakeholders (peers, platform team, or others) for review. 

## User story 2

As a member of a product team, I want a content sandbox so that you can experiment, and make and preview content changes without worrying about impact on production environments. 

## User story 3

As a user of a demo or sandbox environment, I want to refresh it with the latest content from production, for additional review or experimentation.

## User story 4

As a member of a product team wanting to test content changes along with unmerged VACMS or vets-website code changes, I want an environment where i can work with CMS and vets-website branches other than master.
 * Scenario 1: VACMS master and vets-website feature branch
 * Scenario 2: VACMS feature branch and vets-website feature branch
