# Change management

## What is change management for Drupal CMS
Product teams may modify existing features or workflows, or create new features or workflows, that require change management for Drupal Editors.
Change management might include: 
* Creating new or updating knowledge base in https://prod.cms.va.gov/help
* Sending emails to specific editors for awareness of upcoming changes
* Attending Editor office hours to demonstrate new/modified features or flows
* Providing materials to the CMS Helpdesk, to enable them to support Editors


## Sending editor emails
If your product team would like to email a set of Editors about an upcoming change, the Drupal CMS Helpdesk team can assist you. Please plan ahead to make sure you provide Helpdesk with ample notice and time to complete the process.

Broadcast emails to the Editors are sent from the VADrupalCMS@va.gov (va) email account to mitigate replies to or reply-all to Broadcast emails. It further enables CMS Helpdesk to review what was sent and any necessary follow up, from a centralized mailbox.

### How to pull editor email addresses
Within Drupal, visit https://prod.cms.va.gov/admin/people. 
Filter the user list by Section, Role, or Permission to narrow down scope.
Click "Download CSV" and your browser will prompt you to download a CSV list of your filtered users.

### How to share with helpdesk and request email send
Send your draft email to VADrupalCMS@va.gov. Include: 

* Email draft with copy approved by your PO:
  * Subject line
  * Body
  * Screenshots for any steps that will be better explained visually. 
* CSV list of editors by email address, as an attachment
* Timing for when you would prefer the email be sent. The Helpdesk will verify the timing is possible, or may request alternate timing if the CMS team is aware of reasons the timing isn't possible or advised.
