## <a id="whentorequest"></a>When to check-in/collaborate with CMS team

CMS support is available anytime you have questions or want to collaborate on your work, so don't hesitate to reach out at any time. The CMS team is also integrated into the Platform Collaboration Cycle.

### For product designers and managers

**At project kick-off** 
- If your project involves non-authenticated (public) content on VA.gov, it is helpful to get a high level overview of the CMS and its products. CMS team should be included in your Collab Cycle kickoff and Architecture Intent touchpoints.

**During Discovery Design and Development** 
- If your product's content may be managed within the Drupal CMS, the CMS team should be involved in your <a href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/working-with-platform-design-team.md#design-intent-check-in">design intent review</a>. 
- If your product involves additions to the content model and/or the editorial experience, please involve the CMS team through the collaboration cycle. Your designs will need a kickoff where it will be determined if there is additional need for a midpoint review.   

**Staging Review** 
- If your product involved changes to the Drupal interface, you will be required to add a CMS developer for code review as well as a CMS designer for design review in your Collab Cycle Staging Review. If you are unsure of who to assign the review, please reach out in the team slack #platform-cms-team `@cms-team`.
