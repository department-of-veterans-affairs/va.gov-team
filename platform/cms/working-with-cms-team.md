## <a id="whentorequest"></a>When to check-in/collaborate with CMS team

CMS support is available anytime you have questions or want to collaborate on your work, so don't hesitate to reach out at any time. 

### For product designers and managers

**At project kick-off** 
- If your project involves non-authenticated (public) content, it is helpful to get a high level overview of the CMS and its products. 
- Schedule a 30 minute <a href="#vagov-intro">VA.gov CMS intro</a> by <a href="mailto:VACMSSupport@va.gov?subject=Scheduling+a+VA.gov+intro>">sending an email to VACMSSupport@va.gov</a> (or opening an issue?). 

**During Discovery** 
- If your product's content may be managed within the CMS, schedule a <a href="cms-scoping-exercise.md">CMS scoping exercise</a>, around the same time as the <a href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/working-with-platform-design-team.md#design-intent-check-in">design intent review</a>. 

**During Design** 
- If your product involves additions to the content model and/or the editorial experience, please involve (who?) from the CMS team on a regular basis.  

**During Development** 


### For developers 

**Orientation**

- needs writing

**During Development** 
- Back end (CMS) development.
