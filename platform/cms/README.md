# Content Management System

**Editor-centered management for Veteran-centered content**

The CMS team's mission is to empower VA content editors with the tools they need to create Veteran-centered content. We work to build a content management system that is easy to use, scalable, and facilitates Veteran-centered experiences on VA.gov and beyond.

The CMS has two teams, a Core Application Team and Product Support Team. Our work includes:

| Core Application Team | Product Support Team |
| --- | --- |
| Content API (GraphQL, Content Export) | Onboarding of new Products |
| Content Ops: Editorial Workflows & Tools | Product Strategy & Launch Runbooks |
| User Account & Permissions Governance | Content Strategy / Modeling / Governance |
| UX Design & Research | Drupal Engineering for Product teams |
| DevOps / Infrastructure / Demo Environments | Data Migration for Product teams |
| CMS Application Architecture & Quality Control | CMS Training |
| CMS Design System | |
| CMS Helpdesk | |

## A guide to CMS Documentation 

Documentation about the CMS lives in various places
* The CMS itself houses [CMS user guides](https://prod.cms.va.gov/documentation) (VA network access required, and CMS login required, for now). 
* The [va.gov-cms repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms) contains docs for developers working on the CMS codebase.
* Strategy, process, and artifacts from UX/design work is indexed on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/s8YUHlLt/design-artifact-index)
* [The directory containing this README](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/cms) contains documentation needed by other VA.gov teams, such as Platform (VSP) or product (VSA) teams. Read more about [using the va.gov-team repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/orientation/repo-guidelines.md#naming-guidelines).
* [Confluence](https://va-gov.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VAGOV/pages/179765342/2020-2021) houses private documentation used by the team, including our scrum notes, demos, team calendars, and ship reports. We may stop using Confluence at some point, and replace it with the two documentation homes mentioned below.
* [Shared Drive in Google](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ADx85_gnl3Y4Uk9PVA) is used for WIP documentation and deliverables (such as Research Plan), and other forms collaboration. Also, our defacto home for spreadsheets. Google products are not available on the VA network and the Drive should not be used for any 
* [va.gov-team-sensitive](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive) houses sensitive documentation that should be accessible to certain VA teams, but not made public. This includes [incident reports/post-mortems](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/tree/master/Postmortems) for all teams, and [information specific to the CMS application](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/tree/master/platform/cms) such as login/SSO or other sensitive topics. 

### Documentation resources not currently in use. 

* [va.gov-cms-team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms-team) may house private team documentation. It may replace the CMS team's current use of Confluence.
