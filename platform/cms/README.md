## Guide to CMS Documentation 

Documentation about the CMS lives in various places
* The CMS itself houses [CMS Knowledge Base](https://prod.cms.va.gov/help) (VA network access and CMS login required). 
* The [va.gov-cms repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms) contains docs for developers working on the CMS codebase.
* [The directory containing this README](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/cms) contains documentation needed by other VA.gov teams, such as Platform (VSP) or product (VSA) teams. Read more about [using the va.gov-team repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/orientation/repo-guidelines.md#naming-guidelines).
* [Confluence](https://vfs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PCMS/overview) houses private documentation used by the team, including our scrum notes, demos, team calendars, and ship reports. It also contains archived documentation from 2018/2019.
* [Shared Drive in Google](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ADx85_gnl3Y4Uk9PVA) is used for WIP documentation and deliverables (such as Research Plan), and other collaboratively authored docs. Also, our defacto home for spreadsheets. Google products are not available on the VA network and not available to VA employees.
* [va.gov-team-sensitive](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive) houses sensitive documentation that should be accessible to certain VA teams, but not made public. This includes [incident reports/post-mortems](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/tree/master/Postmortems) for all teams, and [information specific to the CMS application](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/tree/master/platform/cms) such as login/SSO or other sensitive topics.
