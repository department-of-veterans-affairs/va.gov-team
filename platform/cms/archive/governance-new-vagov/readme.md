# Governance - New VA.gov - WIP

This repo contains work-in-progress discovery work and stakeholder interviews relating to governance for the new VA.gov. 

For reference, see also the deck on TeamSite user administration and user permissions overview:

## Questions we're trying to answer: 

- What kind of governance activities currently exist for the legacy VA.gov? 
- What's working, what's not? 
- Who or what teams are responsible for what? 
- What models of governance do other organizations - private or government - use? 
- What governance model and activities should we implement/practice to ensure quality web customer experience on the modernized VA.gov? 

## Stakeholder research interviews: synthesis and recommendations

Consolidated deck - this includes both parts 1 and 2 decks: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/global/governance-new-vagov/Web-content-governance-research-discovery-part2-081921.pdf

## Recommendation: Focus modernized VA.gov governance efforts on PREVENTING rather than fixing issues after publishing

### Invest in staffing digital work with the right cross-functional skillsets

- Either by increasing the staffing of existing VACO and OCTO web teams and centralizing more web functions. 
- Or by retraining or restaffing field offices and each business line.
- Of the 2 approaches, the first approach is probably more feasible and more likely to make bigger impact on site customer experience.
- Using people with “other duties as assigned” roles sets them up for failure—and ultimately degrades the Veteran CX on the site.

### Use more technological solutions to prevent issues

- Automated pre-publishing scans for 508 compliance, link checks, security, auto-notifications to teams when there are errors
- Publishing blocks on non-508 compliant pages and docs.
- More rigid templates designed to prevent human introduction of common errors (heading orders, non-compliant tables), etc. 
- Automated tagging of content pages with the office that published them (traceability, findability)


### Dramatically reduce/limit the number of pages published on the site

- Mega footprint of 450K+ URLs makes it not  possible to know what’s out there. 
- And if we don’t know what’s out there, we can’t really prevent duplicative content. 
- The mega footprint also makes the ‘fix after it’s published’ approach unfeasible. (As soon as something is fixed, more errors are introduced by field offices and business lines; creating an endless chase cycle.)


### Working group focused on action items, training, and codifying processes and rubrics

- Example: Quarterly/annual audits, based on site traffic and/or customer reported issues
- Codifying rules around training, when to use what template 
- Focus on proactive activities to prevent and improve common site issues, based on what will have biggest customer impact
