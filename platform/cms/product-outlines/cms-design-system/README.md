# The CMS Design System

## Problem statement

The Drupal CMS for VA.gov must provide modern, intuitive Authoring Experience (AX) through improvement of visual and functional features and support agile product design and development.

Current Drupal CMS authoring experience lacks consistency, does not comply with Section 508 accessibility standards and is built upon outdated technology (open-source theme “Seven” that is soon to be deprecated).

Agile product design is not well supported given the current state of the CMS and Drupal themes in use.

## Hypothesis

* A Drupal-specific collection of design guidelines and standards will ensure that the Drupal CMS product features are developed in a consistent manner, following latest industry best standards.
* A collection of reusable, well documented and well tested tokens, components and patterns guided by clear standards will ensure consistency in Drupal application UI and support agile product design and development processes not only for the CMS team, but also for VSP Product teams.

## Definition of Done

* The Drupal CMS UI has transitioned to a new theme based on the modern open-source  Drupal Design System (Claro) and USWDS + VA DS standards and guidelines.
* The VA.gov Drupal CMS Design System documentation is developed using an iterative human-centered approach and is publicly available.
* The Drupal CMS Design System documentation is a go-to source for building and iterating on products for both the CMS and broader VSP teams. 
   * Drupal CMS designers and engineers reference and enhance the VA.gov Drupal CMS Design System when building new and iterating on existing CMS products.
   * VSP Product designers and content strategists reference the VA.gov Drupal CMS Design System documentation to learn about CMS content model and capabilities when building new and iterating on existing Veteran-facing products.

## Known Blockers/Dependencies

* None

## User Stories

As an engineer,
* I don't want to build and maintain numerous variations of one component.
* I have sufficient design guidance (variations, states and other behavioral and stylistic details) and code specs (variables, code examples) to complete a feature build

As a UX Designer/Content Strategist,
* I am able to standardize the CMS content model patterns and components as much as possible, so that the CMS users have a consistent, intuitive and pleasant experience.
* I have a set of design standards that makes my design / prototyping work more efficient

As a CMS Product Manager,
* I have access to in-depth documentation of the existing CMS content model patterns,
   * so that I can efficiently build products for VSP teams.
   * so that I have a formalized platform to advocate for reuse of existing CMS content model features instead of adding unique snowflakes

As a VSP Product Owner / VSP Product Designer,
* I have access to in-depth documentation of the existing CMS content model patterns, so that I can build better products faster.
