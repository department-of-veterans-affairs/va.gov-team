# Libraries of reusable content

## Problem statement

Reusable content is the content that is created once and reused in many places within the CMS.

There are several types of reusable content in the CMS today: alerts, promo blocks and Q&A. The experience for managing this content and referencing it from other content is very stripped down and not intuitive.

As the number of reusable content grows over time, the management is becoming more challenging. It is very likely that more reusable content types will be added within the next year. E.g. library of React Widgets, etc. 

The governance and editorial experience for reusable content needs to be designed and made available to CMS users.

## Hypothesis or Bet

* We believe that libraries of reusable content with a well designed authoring/governance experience will make it easier to create and manage  reusable content across the CMS application.

## We will know we're done when... ("Definition of Done")

* Reusable content libraries are designed and made available to the CMS users. 
* Reusable content libraries satisfy governance of reusable content at an enterprise scale.
* Users report an intuitive and frictionless authoring/governance experience when working with libraries of reusable content.

## Known Blockers/Dependencies

* none
