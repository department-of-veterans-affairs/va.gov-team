# User Dashboards

## Problem statement

The profile page is the first page that users see when they login to the CMS. The profile page currently shows only the Sections that the user has access to. 

There is a wealth of untapped opportunities to extend user profiles into helpful dashboards that would help users to orient themselves quickly and benefit from an increased efficiency of navigation to relevant / personalized places in the CMS.

## Hypothesis or Bet

* We believe that providing some basic information on user profiles will:
  * help users get to products they maintain and accomplish their daily tasks faster
  * evaluate what is on other user's plates
  * find help from other users
  * see what sections others can edit
  * and more

## We will know we're done when... ("Definition of Done")

* Users can quickly find the content they need to edit, review or publish and other information that is relevant to their specific work area.
* Users can view other usersâ€™ profiles to stay informed about what their colleagues are doing.

## Known Blockers/Dependencies

* none

## User Stories

* As a CMS user, I want CMS user profiles to provide relevant information, both for myself or for others.
