# The CMS Orientation for VFS teams

## Problem statement

Every time a new person joins the VFS team and needs to collaborate with the CMS team, they need to be introduced to the CMS value proposition and be generally acquainted with the process of working with the CMS and both teams that support it: CMS Core Application Team and CMS Product Support team.

The CMS team needs a set of onboarding materials targeted at VFS team members.

The audience for this material is Product Owners, Product Managers, Engineers, Designers, Researches and other team members.

## Hypothesis or Bet

* A set of standardized onboarding materials about the CMS value proposition, products and the process of collaboration with the CMS will reduce (not eliminate) the duration of one on one time that CMS team members need to spend with each new person that joins VFS teams.
* A set of standardized onboarding materials will open up more possibilities for valuable conversations with new team members instead of rehashing the same material over and over again.

## We will know we're done when... ("Definition of Done")

* Weâ€™ve identified different audiences and interests based on our previous experiences with new VFS  team members and compiled a list of training topics that would be relevant to each group.
* New VFS  team members can be directed to a variety of onboarding/training resources and can pick and choose which ones to review according to their specific need.

## Known Blockers/Dependencies

* none
