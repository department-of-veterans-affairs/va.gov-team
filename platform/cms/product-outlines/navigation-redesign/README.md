# Navigation Redesign

## Problem statement

The OOTB admin menu in the Drupal CMS is designed to support the needs of engineers, not content editors. The Content editors and other user segments should have access to navigation that works for them and helps accomplish their top tasks with minimal friction.

## Hypothesis or Bet

* A navigation designed to serve the needs of various user groups within the CMS will help users accomplish their top tasks faster, with less friction and frustration.
* A navigation needs to be specific to user segments, which will include groups by role, section, etc.

## We will know we're done when... ("Definition of Done")

* Research has been completed to inform usable navigation design.
* Navigation is redesigned and usability is validated with CMS users.
* New navigation design is implemented and serves various user segments in the CMS.
* Navigation standards, guidelines and patterns are documented in the VA.gov CMS Design System.

## Known Blockers/Dependencies

* none
