# Content formatting

## Capitalization
As part of our plain language style, we use sentence capitalization  (only capitalize the first word in a title/header/button) as the standard for the Drupal CMS, with a few exceptions.

- **Use title case capitalization to talk about interface terms.** When using interface terms as proper nouns in a sentence, use title case capitalization. Example: Use the Locations List content type to edit information that appears on the Locations page.
- **Capitalize proper nouns.** The names of content types and other proper nouns should be capitalized.
- **Capitalize acronyms.** All acronyms, for example, 'URL,' should be capitalized.

For more information and examples, visit the [Capitalization page](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/capitalization)  in the VA.gov content style guide.

## Bold & italic text
Use bolded text to call attention to words or phrases that will help the editor understand the content on the page. When writing knowledge base articles, indicate that a word is an interface label by making it bold and using the same sentence case capitalization that appears in the interface. Example: Make the desired changes, then click **Save**.

Don’t use italics. It doesn’t show up well on a screen, and sometimes it can be harder to read than normal text.

For more information and examples, visit the [Bold & italic page](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/bold-text) in the VA.gov content style guide.

## Word list
For most terms, defer to the [VA.gov word list](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/word-list). However there are some terms we use specifically when communicating with Drupal CMS editors that may warrant some special consideration.

- **Facility Locator** - Style as “VA’s facility locator tool”
- **Section** - Try to only use the word section to refer to [Workbench Access Sections](https://prod.cms.va.gov/help/cms-basics/about-cms-account-permissions#sections). Consider synonyms like “area” or “part” for more generic uses of the word section.

## Other formatting
This section includes other examples of formatting in the Drupal CMS.

- Use single quotes to refer to other parts of the website. Example: Indexing behavior can be adjusted using the 'Search settings' page.
- Use the word “Example” instead of e.g., i.e., or “such as.”
