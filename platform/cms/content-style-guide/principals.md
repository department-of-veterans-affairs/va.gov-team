# UX writing principles for the CMS 

## Address the user
Whether it’s help text, labels, or user guides, the words in the CMS are part of a conversation between the system and a user. Good UX manners suggest that the CMS should speak to the user in ways that are relevant and easy to understand, rather than trying to impress the user with its jargon and technical prowess. 


## Be concise
Write text that gives content editors only the information they need to confidently accomplish their tasks with minimal cognitive load, so they can focus their attention on what matters. Allow people to opt in to additional information when appropriate.

## Be clear
Give users the context they need to make confident decisions about their work. Sometimes this will mean using the plainest language possible, other times more technical terms may be necessary. 


## Be useful
Write in a way that builds shared understanding between users, the technology, and the organization about the words and concepts relevant to their work. Useful, strategic writing reduces the need for further communications and content maintenance by implementing in the right places. 



## Be consistent
Apply labels and terms consistently across the entire system to build a coherent experience for CMS users. Work toward reducing the variance between similar words and concepts, and work with others to build a shared vocabulary across teams.



## Provide purpose
Help content editors see themselves as part of a larger strategy to provide better digital services to Veterans by letting them in on the "why" behind CMS product design choices.  



## Build familiarity
Bring content editors on board to the CMS approach by helping them get comfortable with concepts related to  
Drupal and structured content. When introducing technical or unfamiliar terms, include context that provides a definition.



## Encourage human centered design 
Provide guidance that encourages human centered design choices and helps align work with VA.gov and USWDS design principles. Implement guidance where users are most likely to use it, and make it easy for users to understand what features they have at their disposal to solve service and content design problems to meet Veteran needs.



## Writing = designing
Writing shapes user experience just as much as the visual and functional elements of an interface, therefore UX writing should act as a fully integrated practice with other UX research and design activities on the CMS team.

- Helping plan and design user research to include UX writing objectives
- Collaborating with designers on prototypes
