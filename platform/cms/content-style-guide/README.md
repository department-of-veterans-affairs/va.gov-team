# Content style guide for VA.gov Drupal CMS
This is our house style guide for the VA.gov Drupal CMS website. It’s shared across VA administrations and teams, so we can speak with one voice and create a consistent, helpful experience for Drupal CMS editors. This style guide is a living document and will change over time, based on user research and feedback.

## When to use this guide
This guide is to help people make good content decisions when designing parts of the Drupal CMS interface, and to help promote consistency across the application. 

You might be writing a button label, some help text, or even a Knowledge Base article. Anything one of our users reads while using the Drupal CMS counts as content, and should follow the style outlined in this guide. 

There’s a lot this guide won’t cover, especially when it comes to more general determinations about style. When in doubt, follow [VA.gov content style](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/), and if it’s not covered there, follow AP style.
