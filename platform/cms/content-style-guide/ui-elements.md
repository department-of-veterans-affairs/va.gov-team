# UI elements

## Button labels
Buttons signal important calls to action (CTA) and help people quickly see the most important action they need to take on a page.

- Use sentence case (capitalize only the first word).
- Make button labels as short as possible, no more than 35 characters.
- Use short, “trigger" words that clearly signal what will happen when they click the button. Examples: Back, Continue, Cancel request.

For button label examples, visit the [Button labels page](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/button-labels) in the VA.gov content style guide.

## Field labels
Labels should clearly tell editors the purpose of an input field with as few words as possible. Use existing labels when building a page to maintain consistency across pages. Avoid creating new or custom labels.

For more information, visit the [Form labels page](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/form-labels) in the VA.gov content style guide.

## Help text
This text is used in addition to the field labels. If the label needs additional information to  communicate the function of the input field, help text is used to provide a longer description. A UX review is required on all help text.

- Add descriptive text under form elements only when they would be ambiguous without them. Try to make the form label clear by itself.
- Help text should be actionable. Clearly state what action our editors should take when filling out a field or correcting an error.
- For help text on image fields, crop ratios should be included when relevant.

## Field label masterlist
A list of standardized field labels that appear in the Drupal CMS. This list is a continued work in progress as each content type is unique and has specific labels and guidance.

## Links
Links should tell editors what action to take, where to go next, or what information to expect when they select the link.

- Describe the purpose of the link and the destination if it’s taking the reader outside of the Drupal CMS. Don’t make the link so long that the relevant words get lost.
- Avoid generic link text like “Learn more” and “Read more” by themselves.
- Don’t include a link using only the URL itself, the link must have readable link text. 
- Don’t punctuate link text. Exception: Question marks and colons are OK if they’re part of the link copy.
- Don’t add parentheses around a link. 
- Warn users when a link opens in a new tab by adding “(opens in new tab)” after the link. Example: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">[This is a link (opens in new tab)]()</span>
