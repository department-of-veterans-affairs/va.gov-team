# Content principles
By consistently practicing language in an intentional way, we can provide content that supports the editor's needs and improve their experience in the Drupal CMS. Our goal is to help you create consistent, clear, and customer-centered content. Content should follow [plain language standards](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/plain-language/). 

Content shapes editor experience just as much as the visual and functional elements of an interface, therefore content should act as a fully integrated practice with other UX research and design activities on the Drupal CMS team.


### We define better content as:

- **Consistent**. We use labels and terms consistently to inspire trust and confidence in our editors.
- **Conversational.** We use everyday human words and plain language whenever possible. We talk like a human, not like Government.
- **Clear, helpful, and concise.** We present complex information in simple, bite-sized chunks and give users the context they need to make confident decisions about their work.
- **Empathetic.** We talk person-to-person with our editors, and [use person-first language.](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/health-content#1-put-the-person-before-their-condition)

### Our voice in the Drupal CMS should:
- **Be actionable.** We clearly state what action our editors should take when filling out a field or correcting an error.
- **Be useful and build familiarity.** Help editors get comfortable with Drupal concepts and content. When introducing unfamiliar terms, include context that provides a definition. Useful content reduces the need for further communications and content maintenance by implementing in the right places.
- **Provide purpose.** Help editors see themselves as part of a larger strategy to provide better services to Veterans by letting them in on the "why" behind Drupal CMS product design choices.
- **Encourage human centered design .** Provide guidance that helps align work with VA.gov and USWDS design principles. Implement guidance where editors are most likely to use it, and make it easy for editors to understand how they can solve service and content design problems to meet Veteran needs.
- **Use pronouns.** Use "we" and "you" pronouns. Use we/us/our when referring to the Drupal CMS team or Help desk. Use you/your when addressing editors and other audiences.
- **Identify the Drupal CMS consistently.** When speaking about or for the Drupal CMS, say “Drupal CMS” or “the system.”
