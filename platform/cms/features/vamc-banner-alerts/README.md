# VAMC banner alerts and facility operating status

Veterans and VA employees need up-to-date information about the operating status of VHA facilities.

Whether it’s inclement weather or road closures, the VA.gov content management system allows VAMC editors to update facility operating status and add banner alerts and situation updates to VAMC pages, all in one streamlined editorial experience.

Editors of VAMC banner alerts can optionally trigger email bulletins via each VAMC system’s emergency updates email list, either when creating the initial alert, or with additional situation updates that editors add as new information becomes available.

For situations affecting multiple VAMCs, such as a hurricane, VISN or VHA editors can create one banner alert to display across a region.
