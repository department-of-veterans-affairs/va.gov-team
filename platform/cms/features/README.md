# About CMS features

This folder contains high level description of various features of the CMS. The primary audience for these are CMS editors, and they should be written so that they are largely evergreen, and reusable in several places:

* User-facing product release notes
* Training sessions
* Documentation
* A CMS “feature list” (for product owners and VFS teams curious about what the CMS can do)

The goal is to start start writing these before we start work on new features / products, including during CMS scoping exercises, and within epic and enhancement issue templates.

## Template

1. One sentence describing value to end users (keep the focus on vets)
1. Description of the overall editorial experience that supports that value, and other benefits to the business
1. Some details about the functionality

Ideally are limited to about 750 characters.
