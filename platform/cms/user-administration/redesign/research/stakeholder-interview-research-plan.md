# ~~~WIP~~~ Research Plan for User admin service - stakeholder interview research plan

*VFS-CMS team, May 2021*

## Goals

Learn from VA product stakeholders about how they understand the current CMS user admin process for their product, identify gaps, and explore incoming opportunities and threats to inform the governance structure and service design of the CMS user admin service.


## Background

*Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?*

Currently the CMS team manages user accounts on an ad hoc basis, granting new accounts, changing account permissions, and offboarding users when requests come in. This often involves a lot of back and forth to understand who can verify an account request, what level of permissions to assign, and what other requirements (such as training) might be involved. As the number of CMS users has scaled, increasingly our team (and especially our help desk) has struggled with the lack of structure and cross-product consistency for account governance and service process.

We believe that redesigning a user admin service should start with undestanding how VA stakeholders understand their role in the account approval process and product user admin policy, and understand any constraints or requirements to refining these items. 

**What kinds of activities does user administration service cover?**

- Granting new account or permissions change requests
   - Verifying user's permissions with someone associated with their VA product
   - Verifying additional requirements to getting a new account, such as training
   - Creating new accounts or updating permissions in the CMS
- Facilitating onboarding and training requirements
   - Managing training rosters
   - Managing access to training demo environment
- Offboarding accounts
   -  Understanding when to offboard/deactivate a CMS account 


## Research questions

*What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?*

**Current service**

- How do our VA stakeholders understand the value of CMS user administration activities in relation to their product?
- How do VA stakeholders describe their current experience with the CMS user admin service?
- To what extent are VA stakeholders currently involved in new account requests, account verification, and offboarding?


**User admin governance**

- Does OCTODE have the resources/roles in place necessary for governing user administration for their products? 
- Are there one or more people in each product positioned to serve as a user administrator?
   - Where user administator = someone capable of collaborating with the CMS team to establish user admin policy and verify day-to-day incoming account requests (new user/permission change/offboard)?  
- Which products would benefit from a secondary user admin role to manage day-to-day verification requests for a given section?
   - For example, a VAMC user who can verify account requests for other people in their health care system.

**User admin policies**

- What kinds of risks do VA stakeholders anticipate to their product if account permissions, training requirements, or offboarding criteria aren't structured and enforced?
- Besides training, do VA stakeholders have other criteria that must be met for granting new cms accounts for their product? 
- When a member of thier product team leaves their position, who is in charge of their offboarding? 


## Hypothesis

*What is your hypothesis for this research?*

- VA product owners and people serving as the product's user admin would benefit from a more clearly defined process for requesting and verifying user accounts, resulting in CMS onboarding that gets their team members in the system and creating content sooner.
- Conveying the security benefits of a well-defined account offboarding plan may help VA product owners see the value of collaborating with the CMS team on this process.
- While a single user admin role may suffice for many centralized / OCTODE level products, some products with a lot of decentralized/field editors, like VAMCs, may benefit from an additional section-based user admins who can help approve accounts. 
   - For example, the Benefits Hubs product might only need a single role for approving account requests and permissions, while VAMCs might need one product-level role for creating + maintaining the user admin policy, and another set of roles - one per VAMC system - who can verify new account request and permissions.
- While standardizing the process steps for user admin will help streamline our service, each product will need to customize some aspects of their own user admin policy to meet the unique needs.

## Method


### What method of research are you planning?

Stakeholder interviews
- Remote moderated interview via Zoom

## Participants and Recruitment


### Participant criteria 
*What are you looking for in a participant?

We are looking to get input from at least one relevant stakeholder for each product supported by the CMS, including:

- VAMC system
- VA services taxonomy
- Facility status
- VA.gov megamenu
- VA.gov homepage
- Benefits hubs
- Outreach hub
- Resources and support
- Campaign landing page
- VA form detail pages
- Banners and alerts
- Vet Center


We are excluding the following products whose needs are currently covered elsewhere: 

- Media library
- Q&A Library
- Regional Office
- Cemetary  

#### Primary criteria / Must have
*What absolutely must be true in order to run your study? The clearer you can write this criteria, the easier it is to find matches for your study. (i.e. if your study will only work if you're talking to Veterans who have My HealtheVet premium accounts, mention that here. OR, if you are using a prototype tool that will not work well with screen readers, mention that as well.)*

- Has the authority to set user admin policy for their product
- Has the authority to review and approver cms access for their product

#### Secondary criteria / Would like to have
*What other criteria would strengthen your results?*

Also interested in folks who are not the product owner/manager, but may have user admin duities delegated to them by the PO/PM.


### What is your recruitment strategy?
Reach out directly in Slack to relevant participants.

## When?

CMS team sprint 34

Timeline: 
*What dates do you plan to do research? (IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.)

Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? 

*(This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.

30 to 45 minutes.

## Team Roles

*Please list the people who will be serving in each role. Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker
