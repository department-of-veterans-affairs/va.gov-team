# Research Plan for User admin service - stakeholder interview research plan

*VFS-CMS team, May 2021*

## Goals

Learn from VA product stakeholders about how they understand the current CMS user admin process for their product, identify gaps, and explore incoming opportunities and threats to inform the governance structure and service design of the CMS user admin service.

## Background

*Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?*

Currently the CMS team manages user accounts on an ad hoc basis, granting new accounts with appropriate roles and Sections, changing account permissions, and offboarding users when requests come in. This can involve a lot of back and forth to understand who can verify an account request, what level of permissions to assign, and what other requirements (such as training) might be involved. As the number of CMS users has scaled, increasingly our team (and especially our help desk) has struggled with the lack of structure and cross-product consistency for account governance and service process.

We believe that redesigning a user admin service should start with undestanding how VA stakeholders understand their role in the account approval process and product user admin policy, and understand any constraints or requirements to refining these items. 

**What kinds of activities does user administration service cover?**

- Granting new account or permissions change requests
   - Verifying user's permissions with someone associated with their VA product
   - Verifying additional requirements to getting a new account, such as training
   - Creating new accounts or updating permissions in the CMS
- Facilitating onboarding and training requirements
   - Managing training rosters
   - Managing access to training demo environment
- Offboarding accounts
   -  Understanding when to offboard/deactivate a CMS account 


## Research questions

*What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?*

**Current service**

- How do our VA stakeholders understand the value of CMS user administration activities in relation to their product?
- How do VA stakeholders describe their current experience with the CMS user admin service?
- To what extent are VA stakeholders currently involved in new account requests, account verification, and offboarding?

**User admin governance**

- Does OCTODE have the resources/roles in place necessary for governing CMS user administration for their products? 
- Are there one or more people in each product positioned to serve as a user administrator?
   - Where user administator = someone capable of collaborating with the CMS team to establish user admin policy and verify day-to-day incoming account requests (new user/permission change/offboard)?  
- Which products would benefit from a secondary user admin role to manage day-to-day verification requests for a given section?
   - For example, a VAMC user who can verify account requests for other people in their health care system.

**User admin policies**

- What kinds of risks do VA stakeholders anticipate to their product if account permissions, training requirements, or offboarding criteria aren't structured and enforced?
- Besides training, do VA stakeholders have other criteria that must be met for granting new cms accounts for their product? 
- When a member of their product team leaves their position, who is in charge of their offboarding? 

## Hypothesis

*What is your hypothesis for this research?*

- VA product owners and people serving as each product's user admin would benefit from a clearly defined process for requesting and verifying user accounts, resulting in CMS onboarding that gets their team members in the system and managing content sooner.
- Conveying the security benefits of a well-defined account offboarding plan may help VA product owners see the value of collaborating with the CMS team on this process.
- While a single user admin role may suffice for many centralized / OCTODE level products, some products with a lot of decentralized/field editors, like VAMCs, may benefit from an additional section-based user admins who can help approve accounts.
   - For example, the Benefits Hubs product might only need a single role for approving account requests and permissions, while VAMCs might need one product-level role for creating + maintaining the user admin policy, and another set of roles - one per VAMC system - who can verify new account request and permissions.
- We can solve for a diversity of product governance and user admin needs with a standardized set of processes and tools, linked by a consistent language. 

## Method


### What method of research are you planning?

Stakeholder interviews
- Remote moderated interview via Zoom

## Participants and Recruitment


### Participant criteria 
*What are you looking for in a participant?

We are looking to get input from at least one relevant stakeholder for each product supported by the CMS, including:

- VAMC system
- VA services taxonomy
- Facility status
- VA.gov megamenu
- VA.gov homepage
- Benefits hubs
- Outreach hub
- Resources and support
- Campaign landing page
- VA form detail pages
- Banners and alerts
- Vet Center

Some stakeholders will speak to more than one of these products. 

We are excluding the following products whose needs are currently covered elsewhere: 

- Media library
- Q&A Library
- Regional Office
- Cemetary  

#### Primary criteria / Must have

- Has the authority to set user admin policy for their product
- Has the authority to review and approver cms access for their product

#### Secondary criteria / Would like to have

*What other criteria would strengthen your results?*

Also interested in folks who are not the product owner/manager, but may have user admin duities delegated to them by the PO/PM.


### What is your recruitment strategy?
Reach out directly in Slack to relevant participants, and by email where necessary.
