# User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

We use UAT to validate that the features we want to release are working as expected in production environments with real user data. This is distinct from the usability testing we do to iterate on approach throughout the feature lifecycle. It is purely a check on whether the mechanics of the feature are working.

## The challenge of recruiting
UAT requires that the participant we are working with has:
1. They use the system being tested (access to it, and data in it).
2. They are comfortable with sharing enough specifics to help us confirm that things are correct.

This makes recruitment through our standard user research partner challenging. Most teams have resorted to working their personal networks to ask friendlies to make time to help us out. This is stressful for everyone. The participants may be getting last minute requests with tight timelines and pressure to help their colleagues and friends. The feature teams don't know that this is going to work out and are often starting from scratch each time.

## How can we work together to make this easier?
How could we build a pool of known friendly participants that:
- Is accurate about who can help with what, while maintaining participant privacy
- Balances the load on participants so we are not asking too much
- Sets clear expectations about what this experience is like
- Helps teams to plan ahead more and reduce stress and duplicative work
