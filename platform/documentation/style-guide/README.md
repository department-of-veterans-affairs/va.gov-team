# VSP documentation style guide

This is the house style guide for the Veteran-facing Services Platform (VSP). It’s shared across VSP so we can write consistent and effective documentation for teams building on VA.gov.

## Style guide goals


### Promote consistency, quality and scalability across all VSP documentation

Intended for use by any VSP team member, regardless of their role, the style guide empowers people to write quality content, sharing a consistent voice and using consistent terminology in our documentation.


### Be a single source of truth for documentation style-related topics 

Creating and maintaining the style guide is a collaborative effort. It is a record of style decisions made by the Content and IA team, in collaboration with VSP teams and leadership. 


### Evolve over time based on feedback and research

The style guide is a living document. As we update it, we won't necessarily update previously published documentation to match. We strive for consistency, but published docs may not always match the style guide. Always refer to the style guide when writing rather than imitating existing docs that may have outdated style elements.

## Style guide non-goals

This is our VSP house style guide, not a comprehensive writing guide. We assume you know the basics of writing and we focus on topics specific to the unique needs of our content. We aren’t trying to compete with or replace other well-known style guides. 

## Supplementary resources

The [VA.gov content style guide](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/) is our foundation for general guidance on plain language and writing for the web best practices for Veteran-facing content. We follow the VA.gov content recommendations wherever our audience needs overlaps with the needs of Veterans.
