# Word List

The words on this list are relevant to the Veteran-facing Services Platform (VSP) team and require clarification so we are consistent in our documentation. Some possible reasons for a word being on this list include:

*   We want to agree on capitalization or hyphenation.
*   We may call for a preferred version when different teams use variations for the same word.
*   We may call for a more plain language version of a word or recommend that it be defined when used in body copy.

This word list is not a glossary or comprehensive list of VA-related acronyms and terms. 

For terms that are not on this list, refer to:

*   [VA.gov Style Guide Word List](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/word-list)
*   DSVA acronym list - This [acronym list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/acronyms) powers a Slackbot that you can use in the DSVA Slack to unpack any VA-related acronym. To use the Slack bot, message yourself by typing `/wtf [some VA acronym]` Example: `/wtf DSVA` Note that the list includes over 5,000 acronyms and the same acronym is often used to mean different things in different contexts.
*   [Merriam-Webster](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/www.merriam-webster.com)

**Suggestions or questions about the word list?**

You can [create a style guide request](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=gmaciolek%2C+kristinagore&labels=content-ia-team%2C+documentation-support%2C+documentation-style-guide&template=documentation-style-guide-request.md&title=Documentation+Style+Guide+Request) or let us know in [#vsp-content-ia](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CL181NRJQ).
