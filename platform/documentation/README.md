### Platform Content Team

Vital to the success of VA.gov , The Platform Content Team builds, organizes, writes, edits, and maintains VA.gov's owner’s manual: [The Platform website](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/). Our centralized, easily accessible knowledge base contains over 700 documents that empower developers to optimize their Veteran-facing products; which, in turn, empowers Veterans to efficiently access the benefits they’ve earned. Our flexibility and versatility allow us to respond to the ever-changing and ever-improving digital products and services offered to Veterans. In our four year history, we’ve archived, deprecated, and deleted several hundred vestigial documents; integrated dozens of new features, programs, and services; and deployed well over 5,000 new and updated documents. Our attention to detail, high standards, and thorough vetting of every document that passes through our team enables us to sustain cohesive documentation over a large variety of disparate subjects. We help lead a knowledge-sharing community that encourages collaboration and reduces redundancy while quickly connecting the user to the information they need, when they need it. We are the linchpin that connects engineers to each other and developers to VA.gov.
