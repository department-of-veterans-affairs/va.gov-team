# Accessibility Roadmap for 2021
VA OCTO leadership has created a draft outline for moving accessibility toward [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) by the end of 2021. This document captures the main missions and projected timeline.

## Two main missions
- **Mission 1:** Increase accessibility of all VA.gov tools and products
- **Mission 2:** Establish a trauma informed design practice in the Office of the CTO

## Big projects (bets and initiatives) relating to Mission 1
Increase accessibility of all VA.gov tools and products

1. **Q1: Plan for WCAG 2.1**
    1. Need more people to do this work. WCAG 2.1 requires more cognitive work up-front alongside Design and Content
    1. Add Accessibility Testing Plan as a step one item in the Collaboration Cycle
1. **Q2: Document how WCAG 2.1 impacts VA.gov**
    1. Take a single project and make it 2.1-compliant
    1. That way we can document what kinds of issues we encounter and start to update our standards
1. **Q3: Continue to roll out WCAG 2.1 with new projects and as new staff comes onboard**
    1. Goal is 1 accessibility specialist for every 5 developers
    1. Add 508 Compliance metrics to the public-facing VA.gov dashboard
1. **Publish accessibility stats to the VA.gov dashboard**
    1. All new projects will be upgraded to 2.1 standards

## Big projects (bets and initiatives) relating to Mission 2
Establish a [trauma informed design practice](https://www.slideshare.net/TheresaStewart1/intro-to-trauma-informed-design) in the Office of the CTO)

1. Q1: Kick-off pilot of embedding 1-2 VA social workers in the design team with the goal of establishing a trauma-informed design culture
1. Q2: Run the pilot
1. Assess progress and publish report of our case study
1. Make it permanent to have social workers on the OCTO team
