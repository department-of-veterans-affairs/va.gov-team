# Accessibility Artifacts

A list of expected deliverables and explanation of their contents is listed below. Please note that you will need to create a Markdown file in Github or have access to [TestRail](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/) in order to create these artifacts.

## Test Credentials

Teams should provide a test credentials document for their project. This document helps the accessibility specialists audit your project more quickly and collect any known issues.

1. Markdown
   * Example: [Github test credentials template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/accessibility-test-credentials-template.md)



## Test Plan

Teams should provide a test plan in a Github file, or a TestRail test case for their respective project. This test plan needs to be completed before the accessibility specialist can start their staging review. Delays in providing or finishing your test plan may delay the accessibility review and/or your launch date.
