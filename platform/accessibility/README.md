# Accessibility

VSP Accessibility supports teams building on VA.gov to ensure that nobody is excluded from using products on VA.gov. We provide best practice guidance throughout the development cycle, build and recommend automated testing tools to flag accessibility issues, reducing the manual effort required to fix issues immediately before launch and post-la

## What we do
VSP Accessibility ensures that accessibility and inclusive design are an integral part of product design and development on VA.gov.

* Accessibility is an outcome, generally linked to compliance, ensuring solutions are usable by everyone.
* Inclusive design is a human-centered process considering user diversity, by including and learning from a range of perspectives.

## Working with us
### VSP Collaboration Cycle
The [VSP Collaboration Cycle](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/working-with-vsp/vsp-collaboration-cycle) defines the process for VSP support of VFS teams to ensure that products and services on [VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/) are human-centered, reliable, and continually improving

Accessibility guidance is included in the following phases of the VSP Collaboration Cycle:

* **Project Kickoff:** Incorporating accessibility into the early phases of a project minimizes the need for rework later. Relevant resources:
 * [508 checklist](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/508-checklist.md)
 * [508, accessibility, and inclusive design best practices](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/508-accessibility-best-practices.md).
* **Define:** We help in early project discussions to make sure inclusive design is woven into your work. Main areas to consider at this phase include:
   * challenges with user flows
   * color contrast
   * color blindness
   * accessible interactions
   * design for various device sizes
   * cognitive impact
   * considerations for including diverse research participants
* **Discover:** We provide more specific feedback at this phase, including:
   * relevant design system components and patterns
   * feedback on recruiting diverse research participants
   * additional testing scenarios
* **Build:** We conduct the following accessibility checks:
   * Review your completed test plan and automated end-to-end test results
   * Manually test the [happy path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path)
   * Triage issues for severity and whether they must be fixed pre- or post-launch. This testing is done as part of the VSP staging review.
* **Validate:** Post launch, we do a full accessibility audit and ask the VA 508 office to conduct a review:
   * Post-launch audits uncover usability issues that might not otherwise appear on an automated report.
   * These findings drive future innovation, updates to the design system, and improve research sessions. (Note: This audit was previously done prior to launch, but is now done post-launch to emphasize speed and agility.)
