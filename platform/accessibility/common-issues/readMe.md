# Common Examples of Accessibility Issues 

## Headings

- [Heading levels should increase by one in a logical order](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/19764)
- [Headings should be consistently used](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/25736)
- [Text styled like headings must be marked up as headings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/18246)

## Focus

**[Testing for and fixing focus issues](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/common-issues/focus-order-guidelines.md)**

* [Focus should not be lost on the page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/23968)
* [Focus outline should be removed from non-linked heading](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/common-issues/focus-outline-should-be-removed-from-non-linked-heading.md)

## Cognition
* [Buttons should be styled as buttons and links should be styled as links](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/23171)
* [Buttons MUST have unique and accessible labels](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/18923)
* [Links should not rely on color](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/18442)

## Screen readers

### General issues

* [Visual groupings must be clear to screen reader users using semantic HTML or aria techniques](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/21478)
* [Content being added or removed from the page must announce a change to assistive technology using `aria-live`](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/19660)
* [Decorative content must be implemented in a way it can be ignored by assistive technology](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/common-issues/decorative-content.md)

### Navigation and links

* [Links shouldn't open in a new tab or window unless absolutely required, otherwise notify the user with (open in new tab)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/25112)
* [Links must make sense in context, and should make sense when taken out of context by providing a purpose and target](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/17070)
* [Page navigation should use semantic landmarks and unique labels](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/18398)

### Form design
* [Important unfocusable text sandwiched between form fields must be announced to assistive technology using aria techniques](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/21478)
* [Groups of form elements MUST have group labels (e.g. `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/18569)
