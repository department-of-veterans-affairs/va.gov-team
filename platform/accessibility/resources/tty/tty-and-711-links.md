# Links: TTY 711

## What is a TTY?
TTY stands for Text Telephone. It is also sometimes called a TDD, or Telecommunication Device for the Deaf. TTY is the more widely accepted term, as TTYs are for many people, not just people who are deaf.

A TTY is an access device that lets people who are deaf, hard of hearing or have speech disorders use the telephone to communicate by allowing them to type messages to another individual, instead of verbally talking and actively listening. A TTY assists the conversation by adding a middle person to relay between both parties to communicate.

## How to link TTY 711
Follow the same coding and styling patterns for linking telephone numbers on your platform. The deaf or HOH caller's phone has already been customized to their preferences and is able to dial numbers coded using best practices.

Set TTY numbers apart from other phone numbers by:
- Preceding the number with TTY **or**
- If your UI pattern typically uses a phone icon for phone numbers, use a TTY icon for 711 and all other TTY-specific phone numbers.
- The best practice is to use 711 as it does not require a copy change if the office decides to remove their TTY number.

## Using a TTY
Instructions provided by [AboutTTY.com](http://www.abouttty.com/)
1. Set a telephone handset onto special acoustic cups built into the TTY (some TTY models can be plugged directly into a telephone line). 
1. Next, type the message you want to send on the TTY's keyboard. As you type, the message is sent over the phone line, just like your voice would be sent over the phone line if you were talking. 
1. Then you can read the other person's response on the TTY's text display.

Mobile phones have changed the TTY landscape a bit by offering a variety of [Modes](https://blog.prepscholar.com/what-is-tty-mode-on-a-cell-phone) that can connect TTY devices to the phone or on-phone services. These services provide all callers with more freedom and flexibility. As product makers, our job is to make the numbers apparent and accessible in our UIs.

## TTY 711 is a little different
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) set aside 711 (like it expressly set aside 411 and 911) for a nationwide Telecommunications Relay Service (TRS). When a deaf or hard of hearing individual calls 711, an operator acts as a link between them and a hearing individual.

1. Users tap the TTY:711 link in any of our interfaces to call the relay service.
1. A Relay Service Assistant answers and begins a chat session with the caller, asking whom they'd like to call.
1. The deaf or HOH individual will reply with the standard number displayed on the page, or it will automatically show up on the assistant's screen.
1. The Relay Service Assistant calls the number for the caller.
1. The Caller sees the conversation with the other line as a chat session on their mobile phone. (Other devices have screens, usually in the form of a strip or banner, with a message appearing).
1. The other party will usually not know that the deaf or HOH individual is calling them unless there is a delay in response.
