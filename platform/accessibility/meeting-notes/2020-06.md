# VA 508 Meeting, 11 June, 2020

This document will outline agenda items created or requested by VA Digital Services and the Product Support team. It can be used as a template for upcoming meetings.

## Points of Discussion

1. **VSA's A11yChamps initiative:** Jennifer has created an [accessibility training program](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/a11y-champs#vsa-a11ychamps-program), identified accessibility champions from the VSA teams, and invited a first group to learn more about testing and advocacy.
2. **Training content creators on a11y testing:** VSA is getting ready to train content personnel a11y testing in three environments: VA preview (Drupal), devshop, and production.
3. **Forms Library work:** VSP frontend tools team is looking at our backlog of forms library issues to triage and start making improvements.
4. **Telephone Number component:** One of our developers added a [telephone number component](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/veteran-facing-services-tools/pull/260/files) to the Formation design system a few weeks ago. This gives us a centralized way to ensure critical phone numbers are:
   * Correctly linked
   * Now includes TTY phone numbers
   * Read back to assistive tech using logical groupings. "758" is read as "seven five eight" using smart `aria-label` attributes.
5. **COVID 19 Chatbot update:** VSP spoke with the team yesterday and confirmed the open accessibility issues are dependent on upstream code housed with Microsoft and (possibly) the CDC. VSP has opened tickets and commented on existing ones on the Chatbot code repo.

## Follow Up Items

1. VAOS Quick Test, issue #2 Continue button being non-deterministic after selecting an eye care type. VSP could not reproduce this issue in Chrome or IE11. Should we keep it open and an eye out, or close?

2. AMA pt 2 - upcoming, expected by end of the week
