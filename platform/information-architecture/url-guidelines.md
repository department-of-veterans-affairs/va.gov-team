# URL Guidelines

The URL path is the component of the URL that immediately follows the domain (i.e. www.va.gov) and directs the user to a specific file, or, page on the site. The path is made up of 1 or more directories, depending on how deep the page is within the site.

The full path is primarily determined by the location of the file within the structure of the site – the information architecture.  
The last component - or the file name – should be determined based on the primary topic of the page and SEO keywords. 


### Process/Governance

The URLs are primarily determined by the IA of the site and keyword identification.  

If your project requires the creation of a new content page, form/application or online tool, loop in IA on the project in the early phases for awareness and background.  The IA can also help to identify structural, navigational or labeling considerations early in the process.  

Typical steps in determining a new URL:

1.	Define the IA
  * The IA determines where in the structure the page will live and defines the path of the URL.
  *	This process can, on occasion, require some user research, depending on the extent of the change.  Research methods may include card sorting, tree testing or user interviews. 
2.	Define the Page Name
  * Collaboration between the IA, product and content team to determine page title.
  * Identification of SEO keywords
  *	This info will inform the labeling for the file name in the URL path.
3.	Define the Linking Strategy
  *	Collaboration between IA and product/project team to determine how users will link to the new page.  
    *	Will item live in the primary navigation of the site?
    *	Where are all the entry points to the new page?
  *	This work can be done after the URL is determined, but can sometimes impact the original decision.
  
### Guidelines/Best Practices

  *	Use the page title as your guide, but you do not need to match it exactly.
  *	Use the most descriptive of all the keywords used on the page. Include only keywords that help the reader understand the point of the page.
  * Do not load or repeat keywords in the URL, the search engines will pick up other keywords in the full URL and other elements on the page.  
  *	Don’t include words that don’t add meaning, such as “the” or “a.”
  * Review similar pages on the site for naming consistency. 
  *	Avoid repetition of words. In some cases it may naturally happen, but avoid where possible.
  *	URLs should be all lowercase.
  *	Use hyphens, not underscores. (Underscoring can change two words into one word, so “health care” becomes “healthcare.”)
  *	Keep folder/file names as short as possible without losing the meaning. 
 
 ### Standard URL Formats
 
 For forms, use both the form number, as well as keywords from the form name.
  *	/form-1234-keywords-from-form-name
  *	Example:  https://www.vets.gov/pension/application/form-527EZ-veteran-pension   (This example is not live)
  
  More standards will be added as they are identified.
