# Vanity URL Guidelines & Request Process (DRAFT)

### What is a Vanity URL?
A vanity URL is a custom URL that exists to help users easily get to a specific page of VA.gov.

**Vanity URL vs URL shortener** <br>
- Vanity URLs use common key words to create a shortened but readable URL. Vanity URLs also build off the current domain/brand of the site. An example would be www.va.gov/vre.
- URL shortening services, such as https://go.usa.gov/, create shortened urls using generic and random characters.  They typically do not include the domain/brand of destination site and instead are branded as the URL shortener. An example shortened URL might look like http://go.usa.gov/TBUj.

**Note:** VSP does not set up or utilize URL shorteners.  

### When is a vanity URL appropriate?
The key purpose of a vanity, or shortened, URL is to provide a path to content or tools on VA.gov that's easy to read, understand, remember, type, print, and share.

**Supported scenarios**
- I want to provide a short URL to easily get users to a content page or tool on VA.gov.
- I want to provide a short URL that supports the messaging in my marketing campaign.
		○ This scenario should be evaluated to determine what's best: a campaign landing page vs a shortened URL.

**Not supported**
- I want to provide a short URL to easily get users to a PDF or other file type on VA.gov.
	
	
## Guidelines

**Vanity URLS will use www.va.gov/ with the addition of a keyword segment after the "/"**
- We will not create a custom subdomain or top-level domain. This ensures we maintain the VA.gov brand, consistency, and authority.

**URL keyword segment guidelines:**
- Keep keyword segment to no more than 3 words
- Use the most descriptive keywords; do not load
- Do not repeat "va" in the keyword segment
- Eliminate stop words, unless they add to the context or readability (i.e. memorials-and-benefits vs memorial-benefits)
- Use plain language
- Use dashes between distinct words (i.e. home loans is 2 words, so it would be home-loans)
- Use lowercase letters only
- Be specific to the topic or action
- Only use abbreviations when the abbreviation is a well-known acronym or term


**Must be significantly shorter than the URL currently on the site**
- If the current URL has only one segment after the top level domain, there is no need to create a vanity/shortened url - i.e. www.va.gov/careers-employment should not be shortened.
- Short URLs should be a maximum of 50 characters (~70 characters is the limit on SERPs).
    
**Content must currently exist on the modernized site**
- If the content does not exist, you will need to work with the Public Websites team to create the appropriate landing page first.
- The landing page should clearly speak to the intended topic/question (i.e. if the communication is about home loans, send the user to the home loans landing page, not the housing assistance hub).

**We do not maintain the visibility of the shortened URL; all short URLs are 301 redirects**
- When a user enters or clicks on the vanity/shortened URL, they will be redirected to the existing content page and the full URL path will be exposed in the browser.

**We don't create short URLs for PDFs or any other types of documents/files**
- All shortened URLs must have a landing page to provide context; they should not go to files or documents.

**All shortened URLs should be unique to previously used URLs**
- Ensure that the new URL isn't already in use for a different purpose.
- Ensure that the new URL wasn't already used in the past for a different purpose.
- Ensure that the new URL isn't remarkably similar to a URL in use (i.e. homeloan vs home-loan vs homeloans).


## Request Process

Requests for vanity URLs need to be submitted **AT LEAST** 2 weeks in advance. This allows for time to establish and confirm the final URL and landing page as well as give technical teams time to plan for implementation. 

Ad campaign tracking should be handled by the requestor, and will not be implemented through this process. 


1. Create an issue with the following information provided:

- Briefly describe what this URL will be used for as well as who your audience is.
- What URL should this vanity URL redirect to and why?
- How will users find out about the URL?
  - [ ] In electronic communications such as emails, text messages, or social media posts
  - [ ] In electronic materials such as an image or PDF
  - [ ] In print materials such as forms, brochures, or booklets 
  - [ ] Spoken in an audio or video production 
- Please provide links to or attach examples of the above items that will include the URL
- How will users access the URL?
  - [ ] It will be clickable/tappable within electronic media/communications (i.e. link in an email or text message)
  - [ ] Users will need to type it into a browser
- When does the URL need to be live? (At least 2 weeks' notice is required)
- How long will this URL be used? 
- Who is the point of contact for this URL?

2. Assign the issue to @mnorthuis.

3. The VSP Content & IA team will pick the issue up, work with you to finalize the URL, and assign to the implementation team. 

4. Implementation team will launch and validate the vanity URL, and update the issue once it is live.
