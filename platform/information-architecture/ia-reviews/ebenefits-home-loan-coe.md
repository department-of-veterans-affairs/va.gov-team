## <a name="ia"></a>IA Structure, URLs and Breadcrumbs <br>
*Description of IA or link to site map documentation, the final URLs to be used and breadcrumb requirements.*

- The Housing assistance hub has 2 separate areas - one for home loans and the other for housing grants - making the structure of this hub slightly different than other benefit hubs.  Rather than the typical 3 spoke structure (get, manage, resources), this hub is broken into 2 spokes to separate the 2 different benefit types under housing assistance. Under those 2 spokes, the options/content pages are then ordered based on the get/manage/resources structure, but not labeled as so.  
- A static content page about this benefit already exists, but currently directs users to eBenefits to apply. With this work the static page will be updated appropriately and will direct users to the new online form on VA.gov. 
- The new form will be nested under the [Home loans page](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/) section at the same level as all other home loans pages.
- A new authenticated tool and corresponding static landing page will also be created as part of this experience to allow users to check the status of their COE and download it.
- The diagram below does not represent all pages within this section, only the general hierarchy and key pages impacted.

**Page** | **URL** | **Full Breadcrumb*** | **Notes**
--- | --- | --- | ---
Apply for COE online form | /housing-assistance/home-loans/apply-for-coe-form-26-1880 | Home > Housing assistance > VA-backed home loans > [Online form H1] | The final segment of the breadcrumb should be an exact match to the H1 of the /introduction page of the form. 
Check COE status static page | /housing-assistance/home-loans/check-coe-status | Home > Housing assistance > VA-backed home loans > Check the status of your VA home loan COE | - This is a new static page supporting the authenticated tool to check the status and download a COE. <br> - This page is only displayed for unauthenticated users.  <br> - Once a user is logs in, they should be immediately sent to the tool.  <br> - Authenticated users that link to this page will be automatically directed to the tool, and bypass this page. 
COE status tool | /housing-assistance/home-loans/check-coe-status/your-coe | Home > Housing assistance > VA-backed home loans > Your VA home loan COE | - This is a new authenticated tool that shows the status of a COE application and provides an option to download when applicable. <br> - The breadcrumb for this page does not include the static page segment since authenticated users bypass that page. 

*Note: The full breadcrumb, as shown within the desktop experience, is provided above. The mobile experience has a varied pattern to the breadcrumb, and only shows 1 segment, the parent page.  

## <a name="nav"></a>Navigation and Primary Entry Points <br>
*The primary entry points and changes to global navigation.*

**Please note:** Work with Sitewide content to finalize the link labels, related text and for implementation with Drupal.
