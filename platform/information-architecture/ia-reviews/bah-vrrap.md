## <a name="nav"></a>Navigation and Entry Points <br>
*The primary entry points and changes to global navigation, as well as any potential crosslinking opportunities*

**Priority** | **Nav component or Page** | **Placement** | **Link Destination** | **Description**
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
n/a | Education: [Hub page](https://www.va.gov/education/) |--- | n/a | "Get benefits" section already links to [Other educational assistance programs page](https://www.va.gov/education/other-va-education-benefits)
Must | Education: Left nav | Child of "Other VA education benefits"  | https://www.va.gov/education/other-va-education-benefits/veteran-rapid-retraining-assistance |  Left nav label should match H1, can be shortened to "Veteran Rapid Retraining Assistance" if H1 is too long. <br> Consider reordering the child pages of this section to STEM, NCS, VEAP, VRRAP (based on alpha as well as order of appearance on page)
Must | Education: [Other VA education benefits page](https://www.va.gov/education/other-va-education-benefits/) | Place within content of page, may need new section | https://www.va.gov/education/other-va-education-benefits/veteran-rapid-retraining-assistance |  Consider creating new section on page for "Non-GI Bill education and training options" (label tbd) that would include VRRAP and VRE.
Consider | Careers: Top nav | Promo spot | https://www.va.gov/education/other-va-education-benefits/veteran-rapid-retraining-assistance | Consider taking over the promo spot to highlight the VRRAP program within the careers hub
Consider | Careers: [Hub page](https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/) | Promo spot | https://www.va.gov/education/other-va-education-benefits/veteran-rapid-retraining-assistance | Consider taking over the promo spot to highlight the VRRAP program within the careers hub
n/a | Careers: [Hub page](https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/) |"Get benefits" spoke | n/a | Benefit does not live within this hub and should not be included within the primary "Get benefits" section
n/a | Careers: [Hub page](https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/) | "Other VA benefits and services" section  | n/a |  Section already links to [Other educational assistance programs page](https://www.va.gov/education/other-va-education-benefits).  Teaser text could be updated to reference VRRAP and other programs, but may get too long. 
n/a | Careers: Left nav | ---  | n/a | Benefit does not live within this hub and should not be included within the left nav

***Priority:** Must = Required; Should = Strongly encouraged/best practice; Consider = Suggestion/at your discretion/possible enhancement* 


## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
*Identify if any redirects are needed.  This is not intended to be a complete and final list of redirect needs, but directional information only.*  

-  There is a Teamsite page currently live that explains the [VRRAP](https://benefits.va.gov/gibill/vrrap.asp).  Recommendation is that VBA continue to use this page for general PR and school participation info, and link over to the new pages within the Education hub for Veteran eligibility information and how to apply.  If this is the approach, no redirect is needed for this page. 

Please submit a request for the redirect using the [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=mnorthuis&labels=content-ia-team%2C+ia&template=redirect-request.md&title=Redirect+Request) at least 2 weeks in advance. 
*For more information, see the [Redirect Request Process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/information-architecture/request-redirect.md).*

## <a name="notes"></a>Open Questions & Meetings Notes

3/30/2021 - Open Questions
- Is there an official VA form number?
- Does this content belong in education or careers?  Is the program aimed at Veterans that were in the workforce and are now looking for career/job resources?  Or do Veterans see this as education assistance since it is related to education/training programs?
- What is the plan for the Teamsite page launched: https://benefits.va.gov/gibill/vrrap.asp
  - Will this page be retired redirected to the new page?  Will it continue to exist for purposes of general announcement and info for schools?
