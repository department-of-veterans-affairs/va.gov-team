### IA Structure, URLs and Breadcrumbs <br>
*Description of IA or link to site map documentation, the final URLs to be used and breadcrumb requirements. *

Upon review of the user research and their responses/actions to being asked where they would look for information on the caregiver program or stipend, 50% of the participants went to the "Family member benefits" hub via the link on the home page and 30% used search to ultimately find the existing PCAFC content page.  One individual used the top nav and went to the Family member benefits option under health care. 

Based on this information, my recommendation is place the application and move the existing PCAFC content page under the Family member hub page.  Although this content area was not intended to include child pages, the PCAFC and its application are more broad than Health care or any other single benefit and fit better with the family member content.

### Additional Notes/Recommendations
- Although this recommends shifting some content to live under the family member hub, other dependent/spouse/family/caregiver content is generally specific to a benefit (i.e. disability, health care, etc.) and therefore is not reocmmended to shift to the family member hub. This content is geared towards Caregivers, which is an audience that we do not currently have content for as well as covers multiple benefits and will be best served being separate from a specific benefits hub.
