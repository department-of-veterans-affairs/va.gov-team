### IA Structure, URLs and Breadcrumbs <br>
*Description of IA or link to site map documentation, the final URLs to be used and breadcrumb requirements. *

**Approach**
- This goals of this solution are to
  - Bring both the legacy appeal and the new Decision Review process content together in one content area
  - Ensure entry points to this content are provided where applicable in the benefit section of VA.gov
  - Improve the navigation of the Decision Reviews area
- The approach to meet these goals, is to follow the hub and spoke approach used in our benefit hubs.  This requires the content of the primary Decision Reviews page be converted into the standard benefit hub template, content is arranged into Get/Manage type spokes and left hand navigation is added into the content area for easier navigation.
