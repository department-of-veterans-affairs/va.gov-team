## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
*Illustration and/or description of how users will flow through the experience. The user flow helps illustrate how visitors will navigate to and through your product/feature, ensures all types of visitors and scenarios are accounted for, and aids in identifying all content and messaging needs.*

This illustrates an additional user flow for Veterans who wouldn't qualify due to their income (above $90k).
