# IA Review and Recommendations

**Team:** Public Websites

**Product/Featue:** Yellow Ribbon Participating Schools Finder

**Background/Context:**  To provide Yellow Ribbon (YR) participating school information as more user-friendly content than the current experience of 50+ manual table pages. 

**Review Date:** 2/19/2020

**IA Review Issue:** https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/5192

### IA Structure, URLs and Breadcrumbs <br>
*Description of IA or link to site map documentation, the final URLs to be used and breadcrumb requirements.*

- The new YR school finder tool will live within the Education benefits hub and be linked to from the "More resources" spoke. 
- **Visual sitemap:** Visual IA of education hub showing placement of new content/tool https://app.moqups.com/Rnc4BDEKrA/view/page/a041dc811
- **URL:**  www.va.gov/education/yellow-ribbon-participating-schools <br>
- **Breadcrumbs:** 
  - Initial page:  Home > Education and training > {Find a Yellow Ribbon school}
  - Search results: Home > Education and training > {Find a Yellow Ribbon schoo} > Search results
*Text in brackets should match the H1 of the initial page*

<p>Rationale: Currently the YR participating school legacy pages are linked to from the YR info page which is deep under "About GI Bill benefits" page.  This new content/tool would benefit from more visibility higher in the structure and with upcoming navigation changes, we need to shallow up the IA to under 4 levels.

### Navigation/Entry Points <br>
*The primary entry points and changes to global navigation, as well as any potential crosslinking opportunities*

**Hub Page**
- Add a link and teaser text under the "More information and resources" spoke of the Education benefits hub page (https://www.va.gov/education/)
- The option should be the 2nd option in the list, just below the GI Bill Comparison tool option
- Work with your writer to determine the link label and teaser text.  

**Left Nav**
- Add a link to the Education hub left nav under the "More resources" spoke
- The option should be the 2nd option in the list, just below the GI Bill Comparison tool option
- Work with your writer to finalize the link label, suggestion "Yellow Ribbon participating schools" 

 **Additional Linking**
- Link to the new content/tool should be included on:https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/yellow-ribbon-program/
 - Consider adding a link to the right rail of the GI Bill Comparison tool: https://www.va.gov/gi-bill-comparison-tool
 
 **Exit Points**
 - Since there is no left hand navigation on this tool, ensure that there are clear CTAs to take users back into appropriate information and next steps in their benefit lifecycle.  Recommend providing links to:
  - YR information page
  - GI Bill eligibility page
  - GI Bill How to Apply page

### Redirects/Canonical <br>
*Identify if any redirect or canonical tags are needed.  This is not intended to be a complete and final list of redirect needs, but directional information only.*  

- Redirects will be needed for the legacy content pages.  A redirect request ticket has already been created, but all URLs that need to be redirected will need to be identified. 
- There may be legacy pages containing historical participating school info, it will need to be determined if that information needs to remain available or if it can also be retired/redirected. 
- Redirect ticket: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/4975
