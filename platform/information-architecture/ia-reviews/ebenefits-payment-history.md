### Meetings Notes and Background Info

**Kick-off 3/19/2020**
- login and see payments issued to me, click on line item and see detail
- data table that is returned, leaning towards table data
- no transactional functionality, all just viewing data, may need some interactions i.e. sorting, pagination, filtering, etc
- usability testing needed
- VSP recommended looking at BAM2 order history work, as its tabular data,  as well Yellow Ribbon tool and Find forms
- amount of data returned is and could be very large
