**Page** | **URL** | **Breadcrumb** | **Notes**
--- | --- | --- | ---
Virtual agent chatbot page   | www.va.gov/contact-us/virtual-agent/ | Home > Contact us > [Virtual agent page H1]   | Page should be set as noindex and not included in xml sitemap during scaled roll-out to keep search engines from crawling and indexing.  Once tools is fully live, page can be indexed and added to xml sitemap.  


## <a name="nav"></a>Navigation and Primary Entry Points <br>
*The primary entry points and changes to global navigation, as well as any potential crosslinking opportunities*

**A/R/M** | **Page/component** | **Link destination** | **Placement/description of change**

## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
*Identify if any redirects are needed.  This is not intended to be a complete and final list of redirect needs, but directional information only.*  

-  The previous URL was only used in the staging environment, so no redirects are necessary.

Please submit a request for the redirect using the [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=mnorthuis&labels=content-ia-team%2C+ia&template=redirect-request.md&title=Redirect+Request) at least 2 weeks in advance. 
*For more information, see the [Redirect Request Process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/information-architecture/request-redirect.md).*
