### Meetings Notes and Background Info

11/30/2020 - Usability testing prep
- IA feedback here: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/16671
- Discussion was primarily around the fact that IA has not been determined and early questions from design intent were not answered.  
- Provided guidance on how to consider what IA may be, along with H1, breadcrumbs and URLs.  
- Team may use this study to get early feedback and IA may not be represented accurately in this round. 

8/18/2020 - Design intent
- supporting content - on form or on separate page? confirmation page, confirmation email, print - all yet TBD? minimum expected experience is a confirmation page.
- multiple page form or single page?  Should treat this like other forms with review page to meet user expectations and error validation
- combined form from iris and gibill? mhv? May start out with single form and then fold others in. still unsure if they will be combined or not. 
- they are thinking about a more global contact us "experience", so we should continue to collaborate on that
- unauthenticated form, but need to consider authenticated experience - gibill currently requires login
- IA feedback/questions in design intent ticket: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/12613
- In order to effectively complete IA work, some decisions will need to be made:
  - Will we be implementing 3 independent forms, or will they be combined?
  - If they are 3 independent forms, what is the focus/scope/purpose of each one compared to the other?
  - Will there be additional content either on the page or in a separate page for more indepth information about the form, introduction to the form, etc. Would also like to discuss this in the context of an overall site "Contact us" page/experience.
  
8/12/2020 - Kick-off
- 3 forms - IRIS, GI Bill cust help, MHV
- IRIS interface is what sits behind the contact us option on va.gov
- designed for users to drop a question/note to VA
- put in place in 2003, has grown to support many use cases, 400 backend employees addressing queries and answering questions, 50k inquiries/month
- popular with veterans stationed abroad and those with disabilities
- timeline is short, end of December
- oracle backend going away, articles need to find new home
- MHV is basic, but IRIS and GI bill content needs new home
- assuming learning center is doing migration of some of this content, this team is not doing the work to find a public facing place for all the articles
- all 3 forms migrated around the same time, all are required for MVP version
- team has been working 3-4 weeks, user research with veterans done, using va forms library, having convos with stakeholders on topic/category list
- the topic/category list is confusing to veterans, working to see how it can be simplified
- not sure if these will remain 3 separate forms, seems like mhv should be its own form, but looking at IRIS and GI bill forms to bring together but they ask for different info (i.e. GI Bill requires login and stakeholders can't agree)
