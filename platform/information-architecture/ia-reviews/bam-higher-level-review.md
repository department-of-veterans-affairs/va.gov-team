### Navigation/Entry Points

**Top Nav, Header and Footer**
-	No additional options to be added to the top nav, header or footer
-	Consider changing the “File an Appeal” link and label within the top nav (under Disability fly-out) to prioritize the Decision Review process over the legacy appeals process
o	Change the link label to incorporate the “Decision Review” language – i.e. “Appeal or Request a Decision Review” or “Request a Decision Review or Appeal” (discuss with writer to finalize)
o	Change the links to go to the main Decision Review page instead of the legacy appeals page in disability: https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/

**Add Left Nav**
-	Add a left nav component to the Decision Reviews content area as either part of this work, or as follow up work, to improve navigation within this section of content.  
-	Include a link to this new online form as a child of the Higher-Level Review content page
-	Left nav was defined for this area previously but should be reviewed and revised as needed based on the addition of this option : https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/16360
	
**Disability Hub**
-	Change the existing “File an Appeal” option to include the Decision Review language – i.e. “File an Appeal or Request a Decision Review” (discuss with writer to finalize)
-	Change the link to go to the main Decision Review page instead of the legacy appeals page in disability: https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/

**Other Entry Points:**
-	From within Disability content
o	Entry point from “File a VA disability appeal” page already exists and should remain as is: https://www.va.gov/disability/file-an-appeal/
-	From main Decision Reviews page
o	The main Decision Reviews landing page contains a link to the HLR content page and a PDF download - replace the pdf link with a link to the online form, or add a link to the online form within the content so both options are available.
