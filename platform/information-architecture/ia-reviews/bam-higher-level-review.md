### Navigation/Entry Points

***The following work was done as part of Decision Reviews hub work in early 2020:***

**Top Nav, Header and Footer**
- No additional options to be added to the top nav, header or footer
- Consider changing the “File an Appeal” link and label within the top nav (under Disability fly-out) to prioritize the Decision Review process over the legacy appeals process
  - Change the link label to incorporate the “Decision Review” language – i.e. “Appeal or Request a Decision Review” or “Request a Decision Review or Appeal” (discuss with writer to finalize)
  - Change the links to go to the main Decision Review page instead of the legacy appeals page in disability: https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/

**Decision Reviews Hub**
- Add a left nav component to the Decision Reviews content area as either part of this work, or as follow up work, to improve navigation within this section of content.  
  -Left nav was defined for this area previously but should be reviewed and revised as needed based on the addition of this option : https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/16360
- A link directly to this form should not be added to the hub page at this time

**Disability Hub**
- Change the existing “File an Appeal” option to include the Decision Review language – i.e. “File an Appeal or Request a Decision Review” (discuss with writer to finalize)
- Change the link to go to the main Decision Review page instead of the legacy appeals page in disability: https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/

**Other Entry Points:**
- From within Disability content
  - Entry point from “File a VA disability appeal” page already exists and should remain as is: https://www.va.gov/disability/file-an-appeal/
- From main Decision Reviews page
  - The main Decision Reviews landing page contains a link to the HLR content page and a PDF download - replace the pdf link with a link to the online form, or add a link to the online form within the content so both options are available. 


***Open items to be done with launch of HLR online form:***

**Decision Reviews Left Nav**
- Include a link to this new online form as a child of the Higher-Level Review content page
  - Link text should closely match H1 of form but should not include form number, i.e. "Request a Higher-Level Review"

**Higher-Level Review static page**
- Revise section on how to request an HLR to include information and CTA/button to complete the online form


**Crosslinking**<br>
*Recommendations for potential cross-linking opportunities.  This can be reviewed and modified/added to by the working team.*
