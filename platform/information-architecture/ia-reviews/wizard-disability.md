1. Skip/ignore wizard - This is an optional feature of the wizard pattern.  
    - On the wizard page, an option may be provided that allows the user to skip the wizard or ignore's its recommendation if they want to continue forward on the current application/from.
    - Team to determine if this feature should be allowed for the 526. 
2. Shared wizards - This feature does not apply to the 526. 
~The same wizard may be shared across multiple related applications - i.e. the wizard on each of the education applications will be the same wizard, however the wizards on the chapter 31 and 36 wizards are different.~
    - ~If a wizard routes a user to a different application that shares the same wizard, the user will not need to complete the wizard again.~
    - ~If a wizard routes a user to a different application with a different wizard, the user will need to complete that application's wizard.~ 
3. Start over - This is an optional feature of the wizard pattern.  
    - On the /introduction page when the subway map is displayed, an option may be provided that allows the user to start over/go back complete the wizard again. 
    - This option only appears on the /introduction page
    - ~For wizards used within a application or form "family (i.e. education applications)~ Not applicable to the 526 
      - ~If the user did the wizard on application A, continued to application A, clicking "start over" would return them to the default state of application A~
      - ~If the user did the wizard on application A, was routed to application B, clicking "start over" would return them to the default state of application A~
4. Navigate away/abandon application 
    - If a user navigates away from their application by either navigating away from an unsaved form, choosing to start a new application, or their saved application has expired,  they will need to start over when they return to the application  - in other words, they will need to complete the wizard again. 
6. Resume saved application 
    - If an authenticated user resumes a saved application, they would not need to complete the wizard again.  The saved in progress application will return them to the appropriate place within the application form flow.

### Entry point updates

The following pages have links with labels that indicate they are going directly to file a claim, but link to the "How to apply" page instead.  Link labels should be modified to clearly indicate where they are taking the user (i.e. How to apply page versus the actual application).** 

Other sibling pages have a link label of "Find out how to file a claim for disability compensation."  Recommend using the same verbiage.  If different verbiage is used, all other pages should also be updated for consistency.
