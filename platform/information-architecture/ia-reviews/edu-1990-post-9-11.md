**Page** | **URL** | **Breadcrumb** | **Description**
--- | --- | --- | ---
New auth 1990 form - canonical URL   | /education/apply-for-benefits-form-22-1990/  | Home > Education and training  >  [H1]  |  The canonical URL Is what will be used for entry links to the form.  The form should resolve to the appropriate first page of the form flow (in this case, it would resolve to /introduction/, in the future this could resolve to /start/ if the wizard is relocated to the form flow)




## <a name="nav"></a>Navigation and Primary Entry Points <br>
*The primary entry points and changes to global navigation, as well as any potential crosslinking opportunities*

**Action** | **Placement** | **Destination** | **Description**
--- | --- | --- | ---
Add | [Wizard on Education How to apply page](www.va.gov/education/how-to-apply/)   | New auth 1990 form - /education/apply-for-benefits-form-22-1990/ |  If user selects "yes" for Post-9/11 GI Bill 
Add | [Wizard on Education How to apply page](www.va.gov/education/how-to-apply/)   | Existing 1990 form - /education/apply-for-education-benefits/application/1990/  |  If "no" for Post-9/11 GI Bill 


***Priority:** Must = Required; Should = Strongly encouraged/best practice; Consider = Suggestion/at your discretion/possible enhancement* 


## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
*Identify if any redirects are needed.  This is not intended to be a complete and final list of redirect needs, but directional information only.*
