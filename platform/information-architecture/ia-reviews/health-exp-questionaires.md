### Meetings Notes and Background Info

10/9/2020 - Usability testing prep for pre-visit questionnaire
- initially only for primary care
- users may need/want to access these forms after they submit them
- Team discussed their idea of a "questionnaire manager page" - something that provides info about all forms and access to any form to be completed or already completed
- potentially need an unauthenticated view of a form?
- users will primarily get to these questionnaires via direct link or text, but can also get here from link on appointment list page...and others?
- Feedback documented in issue: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/14473


8/6/2020 - Usability testing prep
- no major IA feedback at this time
- Need to review user flows that are mapped out
- testing prep feedback documented here: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/11838#issue-668134201


7/29/2020 - Kick-off
- how does a Veteran complete pre- and post-appointment questionaires and screeners
- discovery research revealed Veterans are doing a lot of docs on paper and normally not doing it ahead of time, lots of repetitive questions asked
- want info to be leveraged across all VA and community providers - needs to meet needs of Veterans and clinical teams
- ability to do forms when, where and with what device they choose
- questionaires are based on appointments, based on VAOS scheduling integration, will trigger the type of form they need and then hopefully utilizing the VETtext to send notification that the form is out there.  
- want it to be a part of the va.gov experience
- Collecting info will be focus, MHV will control sharing of data and authentication
- forms can be customized by clinic and specialty
- form builder tool is needed, want to standardize where they can but need to allow customizations
-
