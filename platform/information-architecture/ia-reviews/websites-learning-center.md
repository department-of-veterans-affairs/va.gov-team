# IA Design and Recommendations
**STATUS:COMPLETE**
**10/16/2020 - Updated per conversation with Jen Lee**

**Team:**  Public websites

**Product/Featue:** Resources and support

**Background/Context:**   Originally referred to as "Learning center", the team is creating a space on va.gov to house resource and support content that will be published via Drupal. 

**IA Request:** https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/14445

**On this page:**
- [IA structure, URLs and breadcrumbs](#ia)
- [Navigation and entry points](#nav)
- [Redirects](#redirects)
- [Meeting notes](#notes)


## <a name="ia"></a>IA Structure, URLs and Breadcrumbs <br>
*Description of IA or link to site map documentation, the final URLs to be used and breadcrumb requirements.*

### Structure
- The resources and support experience will live within a sub-directory of VA.gov that will allow use of a Search.gov feature to execute a scoped search within just the resources and support content/experience.  
- **UPDATE 10/16/2020** ~Content articles will be organized within a primary category, and topic tags will be used to provide additional labeling and navigational methods.~
- **UPDATE 10/16/2020** ~Categories should be mutually exclusive and broad~
- Category labels should not be repeated within tags

### URLs and breadcrumbs 
- All URLs and breadcrumbs will be generated by Drupal based on the primary category label, tag label and article title entered in Drupal.  System rules should be in place to ensure proper formatting of the URL (i.e. all lower-case, all words separated by dashes, no special characters, etc)
- Article titles (H1s) should have a character limit to ensure succinct aand readable titles are created.
- Once content is published, URLs should not change even if the category, tag or H1 is modified.  Any URL changes will need to be requested through the redirect process to ensure the change is vetted for any issues/conflicts and redirects can be put into place. 
- **UPDATE 10/16/2020** The category will not be included in the URL or breadcrumb for article level pages, since it is not mutually exclusive. 
- ~The recommendation is to include the category in the article breadcrumb and URL to aid users and search engines in understanding the context of the article. However, with the currently defined categories, the following things should be considered:~
  - ~The benefit categories currently defined are not mutually exclusive, but only 1 can be selected.   This could create a situation where content publishers may not assign similar articles to a consistent category resulting in articles not being displayed in an expected category list, or being displayed in a category that seems in accurate.  (i.e. an article about decision reviews may be categorized "decision reviews" most of the time, but some may be categorized "disability"; a user looking for information pertaining to their education appeal may not find it or may be confused that the information does not apply to them due to the "disability" label).~ 
  - ~The "other topics" category does not provide helpful context or description for users or search engines.  "Other" and "uncategorized" categories should be avoided.~ 
  - ~The future amount and type of content that will be moved into the resources and support experience is still a bit unclear, which means that the categories could evolve requiring a reclassification of articles. If the category is included in the url, this reclassification could result in significant redirect work.~ 


**Page**  | **URL** | **Breadcrumb** | **Notes**
--- | --- | --- | ---
Landing page   | www.va.gov/resources/   |  Home  > Resources and support   |  |
Category landing page   | www.va.gov/resources/[category-name]/  |  Home  > Resources and support > [h1] | Category name should be pulled directly from Drupal and used for the last segment of the URL.
Article page   |**UPDATE 10/16/2020** www.va.gov/resources/[article-title]/  <br> ~www.va.gov/resources/[category-name]/[article-title]/~   |  Home  > Resources and support > [Article title] <br> ~Home  > Resources and support > [category-name] > [Article title]~   | Article title should be pulled directly from Drupal and used for both the URL and breadcrumb.   |
Tag landing page   | www.va.gov/resources/tag/[tag-name]/   |  Home  > Resources and support > [h1]   | The url will include a "tag" sub-directory that does not contain any content.  This will provide context to search engines and users that it is a listing page for a specific tag. <br> The actual tag label should be pulled directly from Drupal and be used for the final segment of the url. <br> The breadcrumb will not include the generic "tag" level because it is not part of the content hierarchy and to avoid exposing an empty directory.  |
Search results   | www.va.gov/resources/search/[query-parms]   |  Home  > Resources and support > [h1]  | The H1 should include what the user entered for their search.  <Br> Also repeat user's search entry within the sub-text on page "Showing 1-x of xx results for "[user entered search]" |

## <a name="nav"></a>Navigation and Entry Points <br>
*The primary entry points and changes to global navigation, as well as any potential crosslinking opportunities*

Public websites team will be defining the following:
- Placement of deep links into specific articles from across VA.gov
- CTAs on each article that flow out of the R&S experience
- Navigation design within the R&S experience

**Priority** | **Placement** | **Description**
--- | --- | ---
Should | Footer | Include a link to "Resources and support" in the footer, best placement would be along with the contact info in the far right column of the footer.
Should | Contact us page | Include a link to R&S for users to self-serve or look for a answer prior to submitting a question or making a call
Consider | Ask a question page | Include a link to R&S for users to self-serve or look for a answer prior to submitting a question
Consider | va.gov/search   |  Provide link in right column to go to "Resources and support"  |

***Priority:** Must = Required; Should = Strongly encouraged/best practice; Consider = Suggestion/at your discretion/possible enhancement* 


## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
*Identify if any redirects are needed.  This is not intended to be a complete and final list of redirect needs, but directional information only.*  

-  Option: Redirect the www.va.gov/resources/tag/ url could be redirected to the R&S landing page to avoid any URL hacking resulting in a 404.  This url could also be used for a future designed landing page for navigating by any/all tags.

Please submit a request for the redirect using the [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=mnorthuis&labels=content-ia-team%2C+ia&template=redirect-request.md&title=Redirect+Request) at least 2 weeks in advance. 
*For more information, see the [Redirect Request Process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/information-architecture/request-redirect.md).*
