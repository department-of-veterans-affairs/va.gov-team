# IA Design and Recommendations
**STATUS: IN PROGRESS**

**Team:**  Public websites

**Product/Featue:** Resources and support

**Background/Context:**   Originally referred to as "Learning center", the team is creating a space on va.gov to house resource and support content that will be published via Drupal. 

**IA Request:** https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/14445

**On this page:**
- [IA structure, URLs and breadcrumbs](#ia)
- [User flows](#flows)
- [Navigation and entry points](#nav)
- [Redirects](#redirects)
- [Meeting notes](#notes)


## <a name="ia"></a>IA Structure, URLs and Breadcrumbs <br>
*Description of IA or link to site map documentation, the final URLs to be used and breadcrumb requirements.*

### Structure
- The resources and support experience will live within a sub-directory of VA.gov that will allow use of a Search.gov feature to execute a scoped search within just the resources and support content/experience.  
- Content articles will be organized within a primary category, and topic tags will be used to provide additional labeling and navigational methods.
- All URLs and breadcrumbs will be generated by Drupal based on the primary category label, tag label and article title entered by the content publisher.  System rules must be in place to ensure proper formatting of the URL (i.e. all lower-case, all words separated by dashes, no special characters, etc)
- Article titles (H1s) should have a character limit of no more than 60 characters
- Once content is published, URLs should not change even if the category, tag or H1 is modified.  Any URL changes will need to be requested through the redirect process to ensure the change is vetted for any issues/conflicts and redirects can be put into place.

### URLs and breadcrumbs 
- The recommendation is to include the primary category in the breadcrumb and URL to aid users and search engines in understanding the context of the article. However, with the currently defined primary categories, the following things should be considered:
  - The benefit categories are not mutually exclusive but only 1 can be selected.   This would likely create a situation where content publishers may not assign similar articles to a consistent primary category resulting in articles not being displayed in an expected category list, or being displayed in a category that seems in accurate.  (i.e. an article about decision reviews may be categorized "decision reviews" most of the time, but some may be categorized "disability"; a user looking for information pertaining to their education appeal may not find it or may be confused that the information does not apply to them). 
  - The "other topics" category does not provide helpful context or description for users or search engines.  Given there are only 2 categories in the initial launch, this may not provide much benefit. 
  - The future amount and type of content that will be moved into the resources and support experience is still a bit unclear, which means that the categories could evolve requiring a reclassification of articles.
  - Landing on clear categories from the start is highly recommended - once the URLs are implemented with the category included, making changes to this structure will require a significant lift and all articles will require redirects. 

**Page**  | **URL** | **Breadcrumb** | **Notes**
--- | --- | --- | ---
landing page   | www.va.gov/resources/   |  Home  > Resources and support   |  |
search results   | www.va.gov/resources/search/[query-parms]/   |  Home  > Resources and support > Search results for "[user entered search]  | Include sub-text on page " Showing 1-x of xx results for "[user entered search]" |
category landing page   | www.va.gov/resources/[category-name]/   |  Home  > Resources and support > [h1]   | Category name should be pulled directly from Drupal  |
topic landing page   | www.va.gov/resources/[tag-name]/   |  Home  > Resources and support > [h1]   | Topic name should be pulled directly from Drupal  |
article   | www.va.gov/resources/[category-name]/[article-title]/   |  Home  > Resources and support > [Category name] > [Article title]   | Article title should be pulled directly from Drupal  |

**Examples**

Category landing page
- Category: Account and profile
- URL: www.va.gov/resources/account-and-profile/
- BC: Home > Resources and support > All articles in: account and profile

Tag landing page
- Tag: Claims and appeals status
- URL: www.va.gov/resources/claims-and-appeals-status/
- BC: Home > Resources and support > All articles tagged: claims and appeals status

Article page
- Example H1: How to check the status of your disability claim
- URL: www.va.gov/resources/other-topics-and-questions/how-to-check-the-status-of-your-disability-claim
- BC: Home > Resources and support > Other topics and questions > How to check the status of your disability claim



## <a name="flows"></a>User/Page Flows <br>
*Description of how users will flow through the experience*

- Users will flow into the resources and support content (R&S) through
  - internal/external links leading directly to the Resources and support landing page
  - internal/external links leading to a category or topic landing page
  - internal/external links leading directly to individual articles
- Once within R&S, users can move between R&S pages by searching within R&S, clicking on links to category or topic landing pages, clicking on breadcrumb components, or clicking directly into articles.
- The search function within R&S will allow users to execute a search within just R&S content or across va.gov - results are displayed for both searches within the R&S experience. 
- Each article will also contain a CTA provided by the content publisher that will lead the user out of the R&S area to a relevant page.
- From within R&S, users may exit the experience by 
  - clicking on a link within the va.gov search results
  - clicking on a CTA on one of the article pages
  - navigating to other pages from links within the article
  - navigating to other pages from the header/footer

- Users may go back and forth between the core experience and R&S content during their visit, creating some complex user flows.  Clear link labels and good CTAs on articles will be critical to ensuring users can move between the areas of the site without losing their way.

## <a name="nav"></a>Navigation and Entry Points <br>
*The primary entry points and changes to global navigation, as well as any potential crosslinking opportunities*

Priority | Placement | Description
--- | --- | ---
Must | Footer | 
Must | Ask a question page | 
Should  | va.gov/search   |  Provide link in left column to go to "Resources and support"  |
Must  | Contextual links across site | When possibe and appropriate, include links directly to articles from other content pages within the site

***Priority:** Must = Required; Should = Strongly encouraged/best practice; Consider = Suggestion/at your discretion/possible enhancement* 


## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
*Identify if any redirects are needed.  This is not intended to be a complete and final list of redirect needs, but directional information only.*  

-  

Please submit a request for the redirect using the [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=mnorthuis&labels=content-ia-team%2C+ia&template=redirect-request.md&title=Redirect+Request) at least 2 weeks in advance. 
*For more information, see the [Redirect Request Process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/information-architecture/request-redirect.md).*
