### Meetings Notes and Background Info

12/2/2020 - Danielle, Patrick, Lauren, Shira
- Want to create content page for COVID vaccine information - information about getting the vaccine
- need vanity url for communication purposes, also want to secure variations to ensure other groups within VA do not launch duplicative content
- this content page will provide the user information and faqs on getting the vaccine, along with links to schedule an appointment, message a physician, see info on research and covid faqs content
- future work will include a tool as a way to register/get notified of vaccine updates
- this may become permanent part of the health care tools experience and place for other vaccination info
