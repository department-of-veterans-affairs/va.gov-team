### Meetings Notes and Background Info

5/26/20 - Kick-off
- There's a mess of notifications, no way to ensure they are quality, consistent, and have our voice, and its slow (mail)
- Idea is to build a "notifications platform" - provide ability for stakeholders to send notifications
- first phase of work will focus on breadth - a single communication that touches many business lines, i.e. notification of submitted online application
  - transactionally triggered
  - not sure if it will be CMS
- second phase planned to add depth - i.e. many communications for a single business line
- preference management - depends on initial focus, the idea is that transactional doesn't require management or opt-out
- focus will be based on initial research
