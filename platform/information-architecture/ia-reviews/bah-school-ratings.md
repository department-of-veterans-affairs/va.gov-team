### Meetings Notes and Background Info

**7/17/2020 - Design Intent**
- Only veterans will initially provide ratings
- Discussed color contrast of stars
- Discussed placement of the ratings within the search results card and detail page - top placement may not reflect its priority over all the other info
- Feedback provided here: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/11347


**6/2/2020 - Kick-off**
- Ability for users to rate schools on 5 star scale
- Initial launch will not include narrative reviews, only the 5 star scale
- authentication required?  They are unsure.  We discussed scamming of system.
- Having verified reviewers is high on their list, there needs to be some level of verification
- reviews and ratings do require trust to be helpful
- will be incorporated into comparison tool
- discussed idea of identifying reviewers based on veteran/family or something basic, or what they are attending school for to help users of info relate to results
- users will do the ratings within the comparison tool? don't think users will necessarily navigate back in on their own, they need to be invited to do the review
- how does this relate to the feedback tool?  Matt feels that tool is a potential but is very buried and very hard to get to
- may want to look at suite of tools as a full experience in itself
- would be interesting to compare veterans who are using gi bill versus not at specific school
- I would like to continue conversation around the full suite of tools that are a bit disconnected currently - comparison tool, feedback tool, reviews tool, yellow ribbon, etc.
