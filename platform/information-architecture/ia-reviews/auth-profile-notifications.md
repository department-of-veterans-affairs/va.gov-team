## <a name="ia"></a>IA Structure, URLs and Breadcrumbs <br>
*Description of IA or link to site map documentation, the final URLs to be used and breadcrumb requirements.*


Page | URL | Breadcrumb | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Profile: Notifications setting   | www.va.gov/profile/notifications  | Home > Profile: [H1]   | The final segment of the breadcrumb should pull in the H1 of the page (i.e. Profile: Notifications settings).  Final H1s are determined by the content team.  | 


## <a name="nav"></a>Navigation and Entry Points <br>
*The primary entry points and changes to global navigation, as well as any potential crosslinking opportunities*

Priority | Entry point | Label | Destination | Placement and description
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Must | [Profile](https://staging.va.gov/profile/personal-information) - Left nav | Match H1 of page (i.e. Notification settings) | www.va.gov/profile/notifications | Place option before/above "Connected apps"
Should  | Resources and support article | n/a  |  www.va.gov/profile/notifications |  Sitewide content team to determine H1, content and placement within R&S if this is pursued.  

***Priority:** Must = Required; Should = Strongly encouraged/best practice; Consider = Suggestion/at your discretion/possible enhancement* 


## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
*Identify if any redirects are needed.  This is not intended to be a complete and final list of redirect needs, but directional information only.*  

-  None needed

Please submit a request for the redirect using the [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=mnorthuis&labels=content-ia-team%2C+ia&template=redirect-request.md&title=Redirect+Request) at least 2 weeks in advance.
