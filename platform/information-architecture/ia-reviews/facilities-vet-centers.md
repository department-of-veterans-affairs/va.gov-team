*The primary entry points and changes to global navigation, as well as any potential crosslinking opportunities*

Priority | Placement | Description
--- | --- | ---

***Priority:** Must = Required; Should = Strongly encouraged/best practice; Consider = Suggestion/at your discretion/possible enhancement* 

<hr>

### Redirects <br>
*Identify if any redirects are needed.  This is not intended to be a complete and final list of redirect needs, but directional information only.*  

- 

Please submit a request for the redirect using the [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=mnorthuis&labels=content-ia-team%2C+ia&template=redirect-request.md&title=Redirect+Request) at least 2 weeks in advance.

### Meetings Notes and Background Info

**11/17/2020 - Usability testing prep**
- Veterans are confused about vet center vs va clinic
- Awareness is the biggest thing we are trying to solve
- Are we striking the right tone for messaging, then circling back to where does that messaging live.
- Potential separate campaign landing page to help
- These will be individual sites, not sure if they will live as part of facility locator. They are technically equivalents to medical centers. 
IA feedback documented here: https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsp---product-support-5f85b91c14d8df0018fac414/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/16235

**9/18/20 - Design intent**

Questions
- Breadcrumb?
- A left nav is not included in the wireframe, will there be child pages to this landing page?
- Will services descriptions be custom for each vet center? Or will it be more like VAMCs where there is service taxonomy and national descriptions with the option of adding local information on a separate page?
- Are "Highlight" blocks clickable into a detail page of some sort?  If so, does that page live elsewhere on the site or as part of this facility?
- Do we need an operating status page?
- Will these pages live independently of the FL or inside the FL? Do we want these to have clear and short URLs for direct access or will users primarily access via FL?

- mobile

Meeting notes
- Dave C - working on changing the health services taxonomy into a more general services taxonomy that is more inclusive
- This may be a single page in some instances or multiple pages depending on the size and breadth of the services offered

**9/3/20 - Vet center kick off**

- Vet centers are part of VHA, community based centers that offer many services for Veterans and families, frequently the first touch point a Veteran has with VA, integral with the transition into VA, do help with full journey, help with major adjustments after Veterans return from combat
- Relationships with the vet center can be long term/life long
- There is no online presence except basic page facility locator
- Started services taxonomy, looking to shift into the page design and then shift back to taxonomy to fine tune
- Drupal managed content and authoring experience, basic information through API
- Pages should look like VA but look like a Vet Center
- Ryan T - there was work done on this earlier; Michelle - we decided to start from scratch to hear what it is they need and to not start biased, will reference
- They have a lot of events
- Success measures - increasing utilization of services (not sure how to get at that), traffic to pages, consider focusing in on behaviors we can drive from these page (i.e. the CTAs we have)
- 300 stand alone facilities, a handful of outstations, many informal access points, mobile vet centers.  Will likely focus on the primary vet centers, not as formal as a network as VAMCs, this structure is a bit TBD yet, sent earlier IA work to Meg
