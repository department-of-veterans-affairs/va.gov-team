### IA Structure, URLs and Breadcrumbs <br>
*Description of IA or link to site map documentation, the final URLs to be used and breadcrumb requirements. *

**Approach:**
- Single static supporting content page that will be linked to from primary Coronavirus pages and communications
- Will live off root level as temporary page

Page | URL | Breadcrumb
--- | --- | ---
FAQ page - new | www.va.gov/coronavirus-veteran-frequently-asked-questions | Home > Coronavirus FAQ: What Veterans need to know

### Navigation Changes and Entry and Exit Points <br>
*The primary entry points and changes to global navigation, as well as any potential crosslinking opportunities*

Priority | Placement | Description
--- | --- | ---
High | The VA.gov homepage COVID-19 OPIA banner | Recommend replacing the link to call their VAMC to link to this content to better direct traffic as appropriate.  
High | VHA public health page | Add link in "What should Veterans do" section as well as in right column Resources section
High | Other VAMC website pages | VAMCs should be encouraged to link to this page
Med | External sites and social media | Encourage linking to this content whenever possible to aid users in best determining when to call, where to go, etc. rather than directing them straight to VAMCs or Call Center. 


The above linking opportunities rated "medium" or "low" are purely recommendations and can be utilized at your team's discretion.

### Redirects <br>
