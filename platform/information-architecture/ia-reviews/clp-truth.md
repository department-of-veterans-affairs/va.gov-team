# IA Design and Recommendations
**STATUS: COMPLETE 04/26/2021, UPDATED 04/29/2021**

**Product/Featue:**  CLP - VA Veteran Truth

**IA Request:** https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsp---product-support-5f85b91c14d8df0018fac414/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/23519

**On this page:**
- [IA structure, URLs and breadcrumbs](#ia)
- [Navigation and entry points](#nav)
- [Redirects](#redirects)
- [Meeting notes](#notes)


## <a name="ia"></a>IA Structure, URLs and Breadcrumbs <br>
*Description of IA or link to site map documentation, the final URLs to be used and breadcrumb requirements.*

- This will be a stand-alone campaign landing page that will sit at the root level of VA.gov
- The page will be given a standard URL that will be used for any links within the site.
- A vanity URL will be created for communication/campaign use (see the redirect section for details)

Page | URL | Breadcrumb | Notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
Campaign landing page   | TBD ~www.va.gov/veteran-trust-in-va/~  | n/a  |  Template does not have a breadcrumb. 



## <a name="nav"></a>Navigation and Entry Points <br>
*The primary entry points and changes to global navigation, as well as any potential crosslinking opportunities*

**No entry points will be added to the core site for pages utilizing the CLP template. Traffic will be directed to these pages via campaign communications.**


~Priority~ | ~Placement~ | ~Destination~ | ~Description~  
--- | --- | --- | ---
~Consider~ | ~Top Nav - About VA menu~ | ~www.va.gov/veteran-trust-in-va/~ | ~A link could be considered for the "Learn about VA" column.  Recommended placement there would be as the 4th option, just after "VA plans, budget, and performance".  <br>Links added to the top nav must be approved by appropriate OCTO-DE stakeholders.~
~Consider~ | ~Top Nav - About VA menu promo spot~ | ~www.va.gov/veteran-trust-in-va/~ | ~The promo spot could be utilized to highlight the campaign and provide quick access to the CLP.  <br>Promo spot changes must be approved by appropriate OCTO-DE stakeholders.~
~Consider~ | ~Footer~ |  ~www.va.gov/veteran-trust-in-va/~  | ~The very bottom 2 lines of the footer include a number required gov links as well as broad VA links.  They are listed in alpha order.  This option could be labeled something like "Veteran Trust" and listed in proximity to the dashboard and portrait project links. <br>Links added to the footer must be approved by appropriate OCTO-DE stakeholders.~  

***Priority:** Must = Required; Should = Strongly encouraged/best practice; Consider = Suggestion/at your discretion/possible enhancement* 


## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
*Identify if any redirects are needed.  This is not intended to be a complete and final list of redirect needs, but directional information only.*  

-  Stakeholders have requested a vanity URL for the campaign.  
- **Please submit a request for the redirect using the [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=mnorthuis&labels=content-ia-team%2C+ia&template=redirect-request.md&title=Redirect+Request) at least 2 weeks in advance.**

Vanity URL | Redirect to | Notes
--- | --- | ---
www.va.gov/Trust | www.va.gov/veteran-trust-in-va/ | This is the vanity URL requested by stakeholders.
www.va.gov/trust | www.va.gov/veteran-trust-in-va/ | This is an additional redirect for the lower-case version of the vanity URL. 


*For more information, see the [Redirect Request Process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/information-architecture/request-redirect.md).*

## <a name="notes"></a>Meetings Notes and Background Info

04/29/2021 - Convo with Meg and Jen
- CLPs should not be linked to from global navigation elements. Going forward, no entry points will be recommended, the requesting stakeholder will be responsibe for driving traffic via campaign communication messages. 
  - Above recommendations will be updated to remove the entry point recommendations
  - Related convo/task: IA will be working on documenting standards and guidelines for global navigation elements to be integrated with design.va.gov.  The ability to add items to global nav components will require that the request 1) falls into the guidelines for the component and 2) has appropriate approval from OCTO IA lead and OPIA. 
- Agreed that all CLP pages should be placed within a section in the IA, rather than at the root level.  The team will brainstorm the appropriate URL/sub-directory labeling for these pages; Meg to communicate the final decision. Page name will be based on the H1. 
  -  Above documented URL for this particular CLP will be modifed based on the determined sub-directory label.
- Vanity URL guidelines will need to be enforced to ensure that vanity URLs 1) are properly structured and selected and 2) do not impede on core content.
  - Will need to follow up on requested vanity URLs above
  - Related convo/task: Review and update vanity URL guidelines to reflect any exceptions based on CLP needs (i.e. capitalization)
