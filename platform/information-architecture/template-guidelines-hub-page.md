# Template Guidelines


## Page Type:  Hub

Mockup/Example: https://app.moqups.com/Rnc4BDEKrA/view/page/a8b9b0da7

**Page Purpose/Intent:**
- Serves as a key landing page for a benefit area and provides content and links to help users understand what information is available in that section.  
- The hub page can also act as a target landing page for outreach materials. 
- Hub pages should only be used for the top level page in a benefit or content area, and were specifically designed for benefit content areas.  

### Components

**Page Title:**
Name of the benefit area. Each benefit area includes a unique icon that represents the benefit.  

**Intro Text:**
Brief description of content within the hub.

**On This Page:**
Jump links to each of the spokes. 

**Key Resources:**
Links to the 5 most frequently used resources.

**Crisis Callout:**
Only used when there is a critical call-out needed for the hub.  Primarily used for homeless or mental health services. Not used on all hubs. 

**Spokes:**
- A sub-grouping of pages/links that exist in the hub.  
- Spokes should not include links to non-Veteran content. 
- There should be no more than 3 spokes.    There should be a max of 10 links in each spoke.  
- The standard spokes for core benefits are:  Get Benefits, Manage Benefits, More Resources
- Some hubs may have slightly different spokes based on the needs or content structure of that area - exceptions/variations to this approach are defined below
 - Get Benefits spoke - includes links to pages that are specifically about learning and applying for the benefit, also includes additional related benefits in the same hub (i.e. family specific or secondary benefits)
  - Manage Benefits spoke - includes links to pages/tools that allow users to manage the benefit (after they have applied)
  - More Resources spoke - includes links to helpful pages/tools that users may want to reference before and/or after applying. 

*Housing Hub*
- Spokes are based on the 2 sub-benefits in this area - Home Loans and Housing Grants
- Within each spoke, options are ordered based on the Get, Manage and More approach

*Burials Hub*
- There are no benefits to manage in this area, so that spoke has been replaced with a spoke that revolves around how/when to use the benefits called "Plan a Burial".

*Records Hub*
- Only 1 spoke that is task based. 

*Family Hub*
- Spokes are based on 2 sub-audiences - general family members and survivors and family caregivers.
- This hub has the addition of eligibility tags under each link to identify who, at a high level, is eligible for each benefit.

*Service Member Hub*
- Spokes are based on pre-transition, during transition and after transition. 
- This hub has the addition of elibility tags under each link to identify who, at a high level, is eligible for each benefit.
- Items in during transition spoke are ordered based on the timeliness in which they need to be applied for. 


**Crosslinking:**
- Links to other benefits and services not within the current hub that are for Veterans and service members or their families.    Options should be for other audiences (i.e. schools, realtors, cemetery management, etc.)   
- Options should only be major VA benefits and services and should link to high level pages. 
- Exceptions/variations defined below.

*Records Hub
- No crosslinking section is included on this hub

*Family Hub
- The crosslinking section is used to highlight benefits that the user may be looking to apply for/manage on behalf of their Veteran. 

*Service Member Hub
- No crosslinking section is included on this hub since all the core VA benefits are included in the main spokes of the page. 


**Promo Spot:**
- Not required for all benefit hubs.   
- Call-out to key content or service directly related to the benefit hub.  
- Same promo that is also displayed in the top nav.
- Should not lead user off VA.gov
- Must be Veteran content

**Ask Questions:**
- Includes link to Iris as well as other key contact numbers for Veterans for that benefit area that are for getting assistance with applying for and managing the benefits in the hub.

**Not a Veteran:**
- Not required for all benefit hubs.
- Includes links to content areas for other audiences/personas served by that benefit/administration. 
- Links should be audience/persona based, not links to single/specific forms or documents.  Ideally we would link to a landing page that can provide information on what is available to that audience/persona or describe the form/document and then link to it.  

**Connect with Us:**
- Not required for all benefit hubs.  
- Primary link is the the Administration that owns the benefit area.
- Includes links to get news/information about that benefit area or administration.
- Includes social media links.
