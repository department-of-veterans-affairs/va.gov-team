## What we do
>*”Information Architecture focuses on organizing, structuring, and labeling content…The goal is to help users find information and complete tasks.“* - Usability.gov

**There are 2 primary focus areas of IA support on VSP**
1. **Site Structure** The overall structure and organization of all content and tools on VA.gov. The structure impacts content design, page flow, URLs, labeling and SEO. We also help ensure proper redirects and/or vanity URLs are in place if needed. 

2. **Navigation and Wayfinding** The flow, labeling and experience of all navigation elements and the identification of primary entry points and key cross-linking opportunities.  This includes top and left navigation components, home and hub page links, the breadcrumb, footer links, related link components, inline content links, etc.  



## Working with us
### When should you think about IA?
- Launching a new content page(s) on VA.gov
- Launching a new tool on VA.gov
- Rewriting content and need to split or merge existing pages
- Looking to improve findability of an existing page or tool
- Taking down a content page and/or tool
- Changing the UX of global navigational elements (i.e. top nav, left nav, breadcrumbs)

### VSP Collaboration Cycle

The [VSP Collaboration Cycle](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/working-with-vsp/vsp-collaboration-cycle) defines the process of how VSP supports VFS teams to ensure that products and services on VA.gov are human-centered, reliable, and continually improving. 

IA guidance is included as a standard part of the VSP Collaboration Cycle:
- **Project Kickoff:** IA follows along with early project activity to understand background, scope, audience and timing.

- **Usability Testing Prep:** We’ll review prototypes or mockups to offer research plan suggestions to help you gather feedback to improve your feature’s findability and SEO value.

- **Information Architecture Request (IA):** IA works asynchronously with teams to ensure that your new or updated content fits well in the VA.gov ecosystem.
 
### Redirect Process
Follow the [Redirect Process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/information-architecture/request-redirect.md) at least 2 weeks before you will need to redirect URL(s). Redirects are reviewed by an IA and then assigned to the appropriate technical team for implementation.
