## What we do
>*”Information Architecture focuses on organizing, structuring, and labeling content…The goal is to help users find information and complete tasks.“* - Usability.gov

**There are 2 primary focus areas of IA support on VSP**
1. **Site Structure** The overall structure and organization of all content and tools on VA.gov. The structure impacts content design, page flow, URLs, labeling and SEO. We also help ensure proper redirects and/or vanity URLs are in place if needed. 

2. **Navigation and Wayfinding** The flow, labeling and experience of all navigation elements and the identification of primary entry points and key cross-linking opportunities.  This includes top and left navigation components, home and hub page links, the breadcrumb, footer links, related link components, inline content links, etc.  



## Working with us
### When should you think about IA?
- Launching a new content page(s) on VA.gov
- Launching a new tool on VA.gov
- Rewriting content and need to split or merge existing pages
- Looking to improve findability of an existing page or tool
- Taking down a content page and/or tool
- Changing the UX of global navigational elements (i.e. top nav, left nav, breadcrumbs)

### VSP Collaboration Cycle

The [VSP Collaboration Cycle](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/working-with-vsp/vsp-collaboration-cycle) defines the process of how VSP supports VFS teams to ensure that products and services on VA.gov are human-centered, reliable, and continually improving. 

IA guidance is included as a standard part of the VSP Collaboration Cycle:
- **Project Kickoff:** IA follows along with early project activity to understand background, scope, audience and timing.

- **Information Architecture Request (IA):** IA works asynchronously with teams to ensure that your new or updated content fits well in the VA.gov ecosystem.  The IA request issue should be created and submitted as soon as kick-off is complete. 

- **Usability Testing Prep:** We’ll review prototypes or mockups for accuracy and offer research plan suggestions to help you gather feedback to improve your feature’s findability and SEO value.


 
### Redirect Process
Follow the [Redirect Process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/information-architecture/request-redirect.md) at least 2 weeks before you will need to redirect URL(s). Redirects are reviewed by an IA and then assigned to the appropriate technical team for implementation.
