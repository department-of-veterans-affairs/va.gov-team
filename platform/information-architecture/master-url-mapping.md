# Master URL Mapping

This file contains a list, by benefit area, of current live URLs and any legacy URLs that have been mapped, or redirected, to them. 
- Each unique page in a benefit hub is numbered, so to get a list/number of pages in an area, sort by the Unique # column.
- To see a specific page and all the URLs that are mapped/redirected to it, sort by the Page/URL column. 

This file also includes information on whether the page should be indexable by search engines and whether it is/should be included on the XML sitemap.

This is a working docoument that is continually updated.  Please check with the IA to ensure the most recent file has been uploaded.
