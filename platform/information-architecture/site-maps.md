# Site Maps

There are 3 resources available to view the VA.gov site map:
- Visual site map: shows the hierarchy and relationship of content pages and tools in a traditional site map view of boxes and arrows.  
- Master URL spreadsheet:  provides a listing of current URLs and page redirects
- XML sitemap: XML output of site structure for search engine consumption

## Visual Site Map

Below is a link to a diagram representing the high level IA and structure of VA.gov created using Moqups tool.

The site map only includes content pages that have been migrated from the legacy Team Site CMS to the new Va.gov tech stack. 

This mock-up/tool is used for early planning of content/page launches and modifications, and is not necessarily updated with all changes in production.  It does not reflect actual H1s, and URLs referenced may not be up to date.  


## Master URL Spreadsheet

This file contains a list, by benefit area, of current live URLs and any legacy URLs that have been mapped, or redirected, to them. 
- Each unique page in a benefit hub is numbered, so to get a list/number of pages in an area, sort by the Unique # column.
- To see a specific page and all the URLs that are mapped/redirected to it, sort by the Page/URL column. 

This file also includes information on whether the page should be indexable by search engines and whether it is/should be included on the XML sitemap.

This is a working docoument managed in Google Sheets that is continually updated.

## XML Site Map

An XML sitemap is an SEO tool that helps Search Engines find and index pages on the site faster and allows them to use our "crawl budget" effectively.
