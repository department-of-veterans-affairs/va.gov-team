# How to coordinate QA testing

1. With as much advance notice as possible, reach out to the QA lead on your program* via Slack to set up a time to go over the product and intended functionality.  You should begin to consider how to test the user stories you are tackling this sprint once you have user stories and acceptance criteria in draft form.
1. Work with QA lead to create a test plan.  You should base the test cases in your test plan on the user stories and acceptance criteria that your team is working on this sprint.  You should create your test plan in TestRail.  You will find guides and examples for all QA related artifacts [here](qa-artifacts.md).  If you request support from VSP then your test plan and test cases will be created in TestRail.  A shared TestRail account for your team, or a dedicated account for your QA resources may be requested.  Details on how to request access and get started are [here](testrail/getting-started.md).
1. The testers assigned to your project will execute the test plan and record any test incidents encountered during testing. Test incidents are created in GitHub and include defects, usability issues, or ambiguity.  Resolutions and comments are recorded in the test incident.  Test incidents will be referenced from within the test case that resulted in the test incident providing traceability.

*If you don't have a QA Lead on your Program, reach out to coordinate a solution with VSP via the [#vsp-product-support](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/vsp-product-support) channel or directly with @Peter Hill on Slack.
