# How to coordinate QA testing

1. With as much advanced notice as possible, reach out to the QA Lead on your program via Slack to set up a time to go over the product and intended functionality
2. Get together documented scenarios for testing, you can use [this QA Testing matrix](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/QA/QA_Testing_Matrix_Template.xlsx)
3. When the product is ready to for QA to begin, Assign a [QA GitHub request issue](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/11243) to your QA Lead with your updated testing matrix linked, and ask for an anticipated completion date.
4. The QA Lead will then go through testing and record any bugs and the implementation team can resolve as needed prior to release - with resolution and validation notes documented in the bug issues.

If you don't have a QA Lead on your Program, reach out to DSVA so they can coordinate a solution with VSP.
