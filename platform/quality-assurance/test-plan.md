## Prepared by: (Names of those who prepared)

## Date: (Date)

### Summary
 A brief summary of the product being tested. A list of user stories may be easiest.

### Proposed Scenarios
Describe what is being tested, such as all the functions of a specific product, its existing interfaces, integration of all functions.

### Risk Analysis
A table of stories that are not testable for various reasons (environment, time, resources, or device availability).  
| Story Reference | Limitation | Risk | Impact |  
| --- | --- | --- | --- |  
| GH #1111 | Unable to process payment with credit card due to lack of test facilities for payment processing | Final payment processing may not function as expected | Legitimate payments could fail to process in production and create a need for an emergency fix / downtime |

### Test Coverage
Describe the combination of devices, browsers, operating systems, and techniques that were used in the course of conducting testing.  For example, E2E tests may provide coverage for regression testing of various browsers, load testing of new components demonstrates code efficiency, and manual testing of newly implemented user stories ensures that changes in functionality have been verified.

### Review
Describe notes and comments derived from the review of QA activities with developers and product manager.
