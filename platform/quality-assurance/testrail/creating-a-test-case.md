# Creating a test case in TestRail

1. Verify that you are logged into the [DSVA VSP TestRail instance](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/).  
1. Navigate to your project by selecting it from the Dashboard.  
1. Click *Add* from the *Actions* panel on the right side of the screen.

1. Enter a *Title* for your test case that describes the user story that is being verified as well as the expected outcome -- for example, "Verify that an authenticated va.gov user is presented a "My Profile" link".  
1. By default, the "Test Case(Text)" template will be selected.  This allows the author to enter test case steps into a single free text field.

*You may prefer to use the "Test Case(Steps)" template which allows the author to enter test steps and the expected outcome for each step into discrete text boxes.*
