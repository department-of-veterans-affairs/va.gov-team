1. If you will be executing the test run then be sure to assign it to yourself using the "Assign To" dropdown.
1. Enter a detailed description of the scope and goal of the test run.  For example, "Mid-sprint test run which will verify the functionality of the user stories (123, 124, 125, and 126) which have been marked feature complete by developers."
