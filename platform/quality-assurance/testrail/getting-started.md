# Getting started with TestRail

1. Get access to VSP's TestRail instance -- [VSP TestRail](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/)
    * Ask for help with setting up a TestRail account in [#vfs-platform-support](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CBU0KDSB1)
    * If you do not receive an answer within a day you may wish to directly contact @Peter Hill on Slack for account setup
1. Peruse the TestRail User guide -- [User Guide](http://docs.gurock.com/testrail-userguide/start)
1. Once you're familiar with TestRail, you may want to [create a new project](creating-a-project.md) if one does not already exist for your team.
