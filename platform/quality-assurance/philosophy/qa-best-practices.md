# Testing
### 1. Test locally (and in review instances) as you build forms (and other functionality).

* Write [Unit Tests](../unit-testing/README.md) to test form (or other) functionality.
* Write [End-to-End Tests](e2e-testing/README.md) to test how a form (or other) functionality interacts with other services, e.g., a data source.

### 2. Test your code after it has been merged to master and is on staging

When your complete and final build has been code reviewed and merged:

* Conduct [Manual Functional Testing](../manual-testing/manual-functional-testing.md)
* Conduct [Cross-browser Manual Testing](cross-browser-manual-testing.md).
* Conduct [Manual Accessibility/508 Compliance Testing](../../Request-Reviews/request-508-review.md#step-2-manually-test-your-code-for-accessibility508-compliance).
* Conduct [User Acceptance Testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Work%20Practices/Product%20Management/UserAcceptanceTesting.md)
