# Testing
### 1. Test locally (and in review instances) as you build forms (and other functionality).

* Write [Unit Tests](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/quality-assurance/unit-testing/README.md) to test form (or other) functionality.
* Write [End-to-End Tests](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/quality-assurance/e2e-testing/README.md) to test how a form (or other) functionality interacts with other services, e.g., a data source.

### 2. Test your code after it has been merged to master and is on staging

When your complete and final build has been code reviewed and merged:

* Conduct [Manual Functional Testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/quality-assurance/manual-testing/manual-functional-testing.md)
* Conduct [Cross-browser Manual Testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/quality-assurance/manual-testing/cross-browser-manual-testing.md).
* Conduct [Manual Accessibility/508 Compliance Testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/508-request-prelaunch-review.md).
* Conduct [User Acceptance Testing]()
