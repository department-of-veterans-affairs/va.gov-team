## Useful tools

### LICEcap
- To create GIF file screenshots to attach to bug cases, you can use LICEcap (downloads found [here](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/)). 

### Dead link checker 
- One way to quickly smoke test link functionality on the full site is to enter the url (e.g., https://staging.va.gov) in this free broken link tool found [here](https://www.deadlinkchecker.com/).
