## User Goals
Users only see error messages when applicable and not by mistake
Users are able to access, view, and navigate the site across all platforms
Users are less likely to request help from an external source like the contact center due to a well defined user experience for all people
Resolve the highest priority issues affecting users in production
## Business Goals
All production ready code is validated in a staging environment to ensure quality
Items that need to be tested individually are tagged with the [QA] tag so that QA can validate them prior to the end testing
After validating reported issues found by the contact center, QA is able to pass the bug to the team in charge of the affected area to be fixed
