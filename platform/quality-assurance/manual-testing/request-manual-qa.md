# Manual QA Strategy

## General
* All teams working on the Veteran-facing Services Platform should compile the following materials for projects being tested:
     - Product Name
     - Product Outline link
     - Staging link
     - Staging user(s)
     - Test Plan
     - Product Manager
     - Engineering Lead

## Request Manual QA
1. File an issue in ```va.gov-team repo``` using the [manual-qa-request template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=peterhill-oddball&labels=product+support&template=manual-qa-request.md&title=Request+manual+QA+services+for+ENTER_PRODUCT_NAME).
    * Assign the issue to: ```pjhill Peter Hill```
    * Follow the instructions within the template to produce a high quality request.
2. **Within 4 business days**, VSP will conduct manual QA using information provided in the [Checklist below](#Manual-qa-checklist).
    * If you don't hear anything after 4 business days, reach out to your VSP Product Support in [#vsp-product-support](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/vsp-product-support).
3. VSP Product Support QA will update the Github issue with relevant [QA artifacts](../qa-artifacts.md).
4. If your QA review results in test incidents, you will need to work with VSP Product Support QA to triage each incident.
   * Determine whether the incident is a defect, enhancement, or misinterpretation of acceptance criteria.
   * Determine a severity for each legitimate issue.
5. Once you have resolved a defect, be sure to mark the corresponding GitHub issue as resolved.
6. After all defects have been resolved, tag your VSP QA reviewer in the request ticket and indicate that all defets have been resolved.
7. VSP QA will verify all defects have been resolved and provide final approval that Manual QA activities have been successfully completed.
