## Quality Assurance Deliverables
    1. Test Plan
        - This artifact usually takes the form of a Word / Google Doc. The test plan artifact is an explanation of the functional changes being developed and a plan for how to test each change.
        - Example: [Google Doc] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/10dYOWyHSTGB_gKiPZSdcdq6fwjrlRhBsK3yUIyS3Gc0/edit?usp=sharing)
    2. Test Cases
        - An export from your test case management software of choice that contains each test case used in your test plan.
        - In the near future, VSP hopes to offer a test case management software that all VFS teams will have access to.
        - Example: [Google Sheet] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yQpyUnt9yoNt_dRCRWW2DIMfRYglCRwT/view?usp=sharing)
    3. Test Case Execution Logs
        - An export from your test case execution tracking software of choice that contains the pass/fail runs for each of the test cases used in your test plan.
        - Example: [Google Sheet](http://example)
    4. Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)
        - This artifact usually takes the form of a Word / Google Doc. The RTM artifact is a mapping from requirement / user story to test case that demonstrates how the functional changes in your product were tested for this release.
        - Example: [Google Doc](http://example)
