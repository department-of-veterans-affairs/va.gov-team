# How QA can mature beyond basic QA testing

- Integrate more closely into implementation teams for short feedback loops, and to give insight into quality risks as early in development lifecycle as possible
- Test "as you go" - i.e. more frequently and earlier than pre-release to help with scenario definition and edge case documentation
- Communicate with developers to assess risk to any part of the VA site by implementation of new feature
- Perform regression smoke tests after release to staging environments (beyond dead link checker; automated regression tests of the VA site, if possible, in case a conflict with unknown dependencies triggered defects on parts of the site unrelated to the release).
