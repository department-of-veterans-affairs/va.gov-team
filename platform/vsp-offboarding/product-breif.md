# VSP’s Offboarding Process Product Brief 

### What is it?

This is a process to remove access from individuals that are/ will be no longer working on VA.gov. We ask that a member of their team or the person themselves that is leaving follow this process to ensure that their access has been successfully removed after leaving.  

### How does it work?

Follow the process for letting the platform know when you or your colleague will be leaving. Once a offboarding request is filed the team will look at the user’s last day on VA.gov and work to remove their access after that day.
