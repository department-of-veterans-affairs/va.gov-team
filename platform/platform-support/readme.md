### VA.gov Platform Support Team

Our value proposition lies in our commitment to delivering prompt and effective support for all types of issues, ensuring minimal disruption to VFS operations. We prioritize critical support issues, offering rapid responses to resolve them efficiently and effectively. At the same time, we provide timely and accurate triage for non-critical issues, ensuring they are properly assessed and addressed without unnecessary delays. By offering this dual approach, we ensure that both urgent and less pressing concerns are handled with the appropriate level of attention and care, leading to improved operational continuity and overall satisfaction for VFS Teams and ultimately Veterans. 

### 2025 OCTO OKR Alignment
 
All issues above allow our internal teams to provide better service, ultimately making VFS Teams more efficient. This directly impacts the results Veterans see. All of these issues have been compared to OKRs and support each of them tangentially. OKRs here.

### List of Products and Services

Product: Support Bot

Our team manages the Support Bot that is the tool that creates tickets in the #vfs-platform-support team channel using the command /support and filling out the fields in the modal window.

Service: Tier 1 and Tier 2 Support for VFS Teams

Our team manages the support processes and related improvements for tickets that come from VFS Teams to Platform. You can see all of the ticket types we handle here: What We Can Help With. 

More specifically, Tier 1 triages tickets as they are submitted and ensures they are properly handled from the time they are opened until the time they are closed. The Tier 1 team then escalates any tickets that require additional resources to the Tier 2 teams with specialties in DevOps, Backend and Frontend engineering.
