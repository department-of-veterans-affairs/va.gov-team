# Privacy Threshold Analysis (PTA)


## Purpose and Scope
The Privacy Threshold Analysis (PTA) is a tool created by the VA Privacy Service and used by Privacy Officers, Information System Owners, Information System Security Officers (ISSOs), and other stakeholders. Based on the information in the PTA, PIA Support determines whether a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is required under the E-Government Act of 2002.
Upon completion of an initial review, the VSP ATO Specialist will forward a copy to the VA PIA Support Mail Group for final review. After the PTA review, the VSP ATO may contact the PM if a PIA may be required.

### TL:DR 
The PTA needs to be completed for any new project or piece of work on VA.gov.  This helps determine what the impact if any there will be on our ATO.   This ensures that your project and work at the VA is compliant with our ATO. The PTA needs to be complete and evaluated before launch.
