# Release Phase

The release phase is a time to get your product fully tested and cleaned up in production and eventually launched to a live audience. This will likely include testing and monitoring it in production, making sure call centers are ready to support it, preparing any marketing or publicity, and actually getting it live for real users -- all with a plan for how to track performance to inform future iterations.

**Below are ideas for things the team can do together to facilitate a solid Product Release. This is a guide, NOT a prescription. Work with your team to identify what your Release plan should look like, what methods and deliverables it should include, in order to get your product live.**
