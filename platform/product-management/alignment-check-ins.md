## Goals
- Ensure alignment on timelines between implementation team, team lead, and stakeholders
- Ensure alignment on deliverables between implementation team, team lead, and stakeholders
- Ensure we understand any requirements/complexities that they've 
- Work drags on, and stakeholders start requiring a date

-------------

# What should we know going into the meeting
- Status of [each item on our PI plan] and any dates associated w/those items
- Any team member changes
- Ad Hoc leadership expecations
- Any anticipated cross-team collab needs

# Questions to help with clarity
- What dates (if any) are stakeholders and Marcy currently expecting for [list each item on your PI plan]?
  - If they expect dates, where did that expectation come from? Is there room to be flexible so we can stay agile, or is there a reason for a hard deadline?
- Have you touched base w/stakeholders since we last met?
  - What's their general feeling toward our work and timeline?
  - What info/updates/docs do you need from us, for you to bring to stakeholders to make your life easier?
- Have you touched base w/our bosses (i.e. for Vets.gov Marcy and Marvo) since we last met?
  - What's their general feeling toward our work and timeline?
- Anything you're nervous about, that might derail things based on what you've learned recently?
- Any potential team member changes coming up that you're aware of?

- Which other teams do we need to share any of the above with?

# Action items post 1:1
- Store notes on expecations / action items (potentially a pinned Slack post)
- Update PI narrative if necessary w/any externalities that may affect the plan
- Share with other teams any cross-impactful items
- Clear up any misalignments between various leadership people
- Escalate blockers, or unexpected stakeholder expecatations to appropriate POCs
