# Implementation Phase

The goal of this phase is to take what was learned in Discovery, and build an end-to-end product in staging. This will involve all disciplines (design, research, product, engineering, content) and likely lots of iterating, testing low-fidelity samples, documenting key decisions, before it's ready to finalize and move on to the next steps (launch).

**Below are ideas for things the team can do together to facilitate good, throrough Implementation. This is a guide, NOT a prescription. Work with your team to identify what your Implementation phase should look like, what methods and deliverables it should include, in order to get your product into a solid state that's ready for the next phase: releasing the live product.**
