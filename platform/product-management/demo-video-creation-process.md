# How to create demo videos for applications/services on the Veteran-facing Services Platform

### 1. Use whatever tool you want to record the video.

Here are some samples:
- https://youtu.be/0cocYJ3_FSo
- https://youtu.be/AZyswX6gCw8

Here are some guidelines to follow:
- Call center likes these videos to have as much detail as possible in under 15 minutes
- Try and show some samples of conditionals: errors you anticipate users may expereince, or use cases you think may happen
- Call out the variety of ways users can get to the page
- Remember that this link could be shared with anyone, so avoid saying things that could rub viewers (Call Center, VA Stakeholders, Vets.gov Stakeholders) the wrong way 

Some people use QuickTime, some people use JoinMe, whatever you'd like.

### 2. Save the video

As MOV, MP4 (MPEG4), AVI, WMV, FLV, 3GP, MPEGPS, or WebM

### 3. Write a transcript for the video

As a Word document

### 4. Request that the video be posted on the VA YouTube channel 

1. Send an email to ```VACODMEVideo@va.gov```. Send the email from your VA.gov email address.
1. In the email include:
    * The video file
    * The video transcript
    * The video title
    * A brief description of the video
    * Ask that they email you a link to the unlisted video when it's posted
1. VA will email you back with a URL to the unlisted video (the video will be visible to users with the URL but won't be visible on the main VA YouTube channel)

### 5. Share the URL as you like!
