# Discovery Phase

What the team works on during the Discovery phase of a product will differ depending on your product and what its maturity is, but it should always involve all disciplines (design, research, product, engineering, content) and it should start off with an explicit goal.

- *Sample goal: recommend solution approach for solving [XYZ] problem.*
- *Sample goal: validate yes/no whether we want to continue pursuing [XYZ].*
- *Sample goal: understand potential value and limitations of [XYZ] API.*
- *Sample goal: decide what API to use to achieve [XYZ] interaction.*

It will usually involve methods to validate assumptions you have about your audience's and business's desires and needs, and exploration of APIs, systems, POCs, patterns, flows that may be best to leverage in possible solutions.

**Below are ideas for things the team can do to facilitate good, throrough Discovery. This is a guide, NOT a prescription. Work with your team to identify what your Discovery phase should look like, what methods and deliverables it should include, in order to meet your specific Discovery goal(s).**

## Suggested issues for consideration

**Planning activities**
- Set up product folder in GitHub
- Create launch checklist
- Create Product Outline
- Define problem, assumed user and business goals, and other assumptions (Product Outline)
- Determine POCs, stakeholders, and implementation team (Product Outline)
- Determine Discovery methods needed
- Determine user research methods needed
- Determine what APIs and/or systems to investigate
- Recruit for stakeholder research
- Recruit for user research
- Determine ideal Discovery outputs and artifacts

**Discovery activities**
- Create user research conversation guide
- Conduct user research
- Create stakeholder research guide
- Conduct stakeholder research
- Conduct API and/or systems reviews
- Determine solution approach (collab with Content, IA, Research, Engineering, Design, Business, Product)
- Conduct any other Discovery activities
- Evaluate integration agreements/SLAs

**Output activities**
- Synthesize findings
- Update Product Folder name(s) and/or or IA (if necessary)
- Fill out known info in technical discovery guide
- Create functional specs skeleton w/known information and questions for further research
- Finish any other artifacts and store in GitHub
- Fill out initial info in Product Outline
- Create Discovery readout
- Schedule and present Discovery readout
- Create and send out Charter
