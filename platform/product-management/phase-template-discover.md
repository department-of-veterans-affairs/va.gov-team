# Discovery Phase

What the team works on during the Discovery phase of a product will differ depending on your product and what its maturity is, but it should always involve all disciplines (design, research, product, engineering, content) and it should start off with an explicit goal.

- *Sample goal: recommend solution approach for solving [XYZ] problem.*
- *Sample goal: validate yes/no whether we want to continue pursuing [XYZ].*
- *Sample goal: understand potential value and limitations of [XYZ] API.*
- *Sample goal: decide what API to use to achieve [XYZ] interaction.*

It will usually involve methods to validate assumptions you have about your audience's and business's desires and needs, and exploration of APIs, systems, POCs, patterns, flows that may be best to leverage in possible solutions.

**Below are ideas for things the team can do to facilitate good, throrough Discovery. This is a guide, NOT a prescription. Work with your team to identify what your Discovery phase should look like, what methods and deliverables it should include, in order to meet your specific Discovery goal(s).**

## Suggested issues for consideration

**Planning activities**
- Set up product folder in GitHub
- Create launch checklist
- Create Product Outline
- Define problem, assumed user and business goals, and other assumptions (Product Outline)
