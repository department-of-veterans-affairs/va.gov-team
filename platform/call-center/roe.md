# Preface
This document will help all team members working on the VA.gov platform understand how the Call Center team handles user issues and when and how the Call Center team will engage VSA/VSP teams to address relevant Tier 3 technical issues. Because of the limited number of resources on the Call Center team, they cannot be a "catch-all" for every issue reported on the platform and every application. Please read the following document carefully in order to determine the appropriate path for your incident.

## Issue Tier Definitions
Tier 0 are non VA.gov technical issues that are handled by another call center. 

Tier 1 issues are problems users experience on VA.gov caused by user error or confusion. These issues will have a specific answer that corrects the user behavior and allows them to complete their task. Examples: Signing in questions, password resets, navigation confusion, etc. 

Tier 2 issues are problems that are not clearly caused by user error or confusion. These types of issues will likely have an associated error message or the explanation will indicate that something technical might have gone wrong. Tier 2 issues require additional follow up with troubleshooting steps and questions, to determine if the issue is blocked by technical issues or can be resolved by trying again later or other work around steps.  

Tier 3 issues are problems that the Call Center team has investigated and determined to be caused by a technical failure. These issues will follow the escalation process and require additional triage work to determine a resolution or work around. Tier 3 will also apply to the following scenarios:
   1. The Call Center tracks a trending issue. A trending issue is when the same issue is reported five times within a designated time         period.
   2. Another Call Center contacts the VSP call center team about a trending issue they are experiencing. 


## IRIS Reporting
VA.gov technical issues are routed to the Call Center IRIS inbox from the Contact Us page on VA.gov. The goal is to either assign, reassign, or respond to each issue within 24 business hours.
- Call Center team will review each issue to determine if an issue is:
   * Tier 0: These will be reassigned to the responsible call center.  
   * Tier 1: These can be handled using a template response from the VA.gov technical issue document.
   * Tier 2: The Call Center team will do additional follow up to determine if these are Tier 3 technical issues. of the issue.
   * Tier 3: The Call Center team will follow the process to escalate these issues to the appropriate VSA/VSP team.
    
    
## SalesForce Reporting
VA.gov issues are captured by WHH (White House Hotline) agents in SalesForce. The goal is to either assign, reassign, or respond within 24 business hours.
- Call Center team will review each issue to determine if an issue is:
   * Tier 0: These will be reassigned to the responsible call center.  
   * Tier 1: These can be handled using a template response from the VA.gov technical issue document.
   * Tier 2: The Call Center team will do additional follow up to determine if these are Tier 3 technical issues. of the issue.
   * Tier 3: The Call Center team will follow the process to escalate these issues to the appropriate VSA/VSP team.


## Compiling Data
Once a Tier 3 issue has been identified, a spreadsheet will be created by the Call Center team containing:
* Date issue reported
* Ticket number
* Description of issue as stated by the customer
* Topic and Sub-topic of the issue
* ALL PII WILL BE REMOVED


## Assigning Issues
Once the data from each source has been entered onto the spreadsheet, copy the information to paste it in a ZH (ZenHub) ticket that will be created.  The criteria for creating a ZH ticket is as follows:
* Issue Title: Brief description of issue
    * Ex. Logon to ID.me error message
* Label: Call Center and any other department that needs research/resolve the issue
* Assignees: All Call Center team members and individuals associated with the team that is researching/resolving the issue.
    * If the Call Center team member is unsure of who the ticket should be assigned to, then it will be assigned to Triage for determination.

## Status Requests
If a Call Center team member has not received an ETA for research or resolution from the appropriate team within 48 business hours, then it is the responsibility of the Call Center team to reach out through ZH to request an update.

## Lack of Communication
If there has been no status update by the end of the 48 business hours, the Call Center team member should escalate the issue to the PM of the team that has been assigned the issue.


## When to engage the Call Center Team
  
**General Rule:** The Call Center team will make every effort to include ALL pertinent infromation on the issue.  However, if more details are needed
- Find the appropriate ZH ticket relating to the issue
- @ all Call Center team members to be notified 
- Enter in all details or questions concerning the issue
  - Not all customers are fluid in technical terms, please attempt to use layman terminology for best responses
  - Be as detailed as possible to prevent or lessen multiple interactions with the customer which will only cause frustration
- A Call Center team member will reach out to the customer within 24 hours of the request
