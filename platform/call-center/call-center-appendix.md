# Health Resource Center Support Overview

## Support provided to vets.gov

The National Call Center - Health Resource Center (HRC) will provide customer support for vets.gov users. The official relationship between HRC and vets.gov will be documented in an official Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and nothing in this document should be construed to override or alter anything contained in the MOU. This document is meant to summarize the relevant portions for vets.gov team members.

### Single point of contact for Veterans

 - HRC will be the single point of contact for all inbound and outbound communications with Veterans and other users of vets.gov on behalf of the vets.gov team.

### Phone support

 - HRC representatives will answer phone calls from 7am to 7pm Central time on 855-574-7286. 800-829-4833 is the TTY number. Options for potential 24 hours a day coverage (e.g., expanding HRC hours, partnering with another call center) will be investigated.

 - A vets.gov specific toll free number will be created and utilized. This will enable improved metrics collection and the simplest user experience.

 - HRC will maintain automated call greetings and messages for the vets.gov phone line (initial answer, call center closed, etc.)

 - Vets.gov will provide approved templates for calls for its products to include what information must be collected.

### Online chat support

 - HRC will provide online chat support for vets.gov using the eGain platform starting in December 2016.

 - The eGain interactions will be tracked and metrics collected into the same system as phone calls

### Email support

 - Vets.gov does not plan to direct users to email support at this time. This decision will be revisited in December 2016 with POCs Nancy Tucker and Michelle Hoxsie-Quinn.

 - HRC only has access to a specialized version of IRIS. HRC has their own interface and receive around 1000 emails a day, with a maximum of 1500 emails per day. Response time is 24hrs to provide pre-written, approved scripts to Veterans.

### Issue Ticket system

 - Vets.gov will utilize the NSD SDM ticketing system, on HRC recommendation, for initial issue ticketing needs. The system is already in use by HRC and has a quick ramp up time. HRC will assist the vets.gov team as needed to ensure smooth usage and transfer of tickets by both sides.

 - Once Microsoft Dynamics becomes available, probably by the end of calendar year 2016, vets.gov may transfer to that new system. Dynamics may provide a simpler experience and better integrations than NSD for long-term usage.

### Metrics

 - HRC will collect their standard suite of customer support metrics to include volume, time to resolution, and average speed of answer.

 - To ease dissemination, HRC will facilitate vets.gov access to the appropriate Sharepoint site(s) where the metrics information can be retrieved.

### Service Level Agreements (SLA)

Vets.gov will use the normal SLA levels that HRC generally provides to include the following targets:

- A five percent or less abandonment rate of phone calls
- A sixty seconds or less average speed to answer
- A twenty-four hours or less email response time

Vets.gov has not yet established its own turn-around time targets for Tier 2/3/4 issues escalated to them. Once determined, those will be documented and shared with HRC.
