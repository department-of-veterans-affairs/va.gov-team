<h1 >Platform Support Form</h1>
<p>The Platform is here to assist with many issues that VFS teams might face during the development cycle. If you need assistance from someone on the Platform, please go to the <a href='https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CBU0KDSB1'>#vfs-platform-support</a> Slack channel, click on the lightning icon below the Message box, and select <em>Need Help from the Platform?</em> or type the /support slash command.</p>
<p>Your support request form will be routed to the appropriate Platform team member who will reply by creating a thread from the form submission posted in the channel.</p>
<p>Platform Support will make sure to respond to your request as soon as possible. Please refer to the <a href='https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/support/Support-overview.604012552.html'>Support overview document</a> for support request turnaround times.</p>
<p>The Platform’s goal is to answer your questions as soon as possible, but if you aren’t getting traction with your request after 1 business day, contact your DSVA lead who will make sure the right people address your question.</p>
<p>Please do not DM a Platform team member that you have worked with previously when you have questions but instead submit a form in the <a href='https://dsva.slack.com/channels/vfs-platform-support'>#vfs-platform-support</a> channel.</p>
