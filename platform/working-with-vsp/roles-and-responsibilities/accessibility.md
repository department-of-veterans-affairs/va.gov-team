# Accessibility

Veteran-facing services (VFS) teams are responsible for ensuring the accessibility of the products. The Digital Experience and Product Office (DEPO) platform supports their work at scale by creating and maintaining VA.gov accessibility standards required for production and by providing guidance as VFS teams work to meet those standards. Code quality -- including meeting [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) compliance ([WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) Level A and AA) -- is the responsibility of each individual VFS team.

## What the DEPO platform provides

- Defines and maintains accessibility standards
- Maintains infrastructure for automated detection of accessibility issues
- Maintains accessibility compliance in common code and libraries
- Conducts accessibility reviews for applications and static content to identify both launch-blocking issues ([Severity 0](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/guidance/defect-severity-rubric.md#508-defect-0) and [Severity 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/guidance/defect-severity-rubric.md#508-defect-1)) as well as other [post-launch improvements](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/guidance/defect-severity-rubric.md#post-launch-issues) (deeper dive with more devices, tools)
- Provides support for accessibility questions via Slack and accessibility office hours

## VFS team responsibilities

- Ensure their applications and code meet [VA.gov accessibility standards](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/accessibility#depo-platform-accessibility-standards)
- Work with the Veteran-facing Services Platform (VSP) team using the [Collaboration Cycle](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/working-with-vsp/vsp-collaboration-cycle) to ensure accessibility standard compliance for:
  - New UI components
  - Changes to existing UI components
  - User flow patterns
  - Larger content changes
- Specialists like accessibility or quality assurance (QA) should provide their design intent and/or usability test prep feedback to DEPO Platform ahead of collaboration cycle meetings. DEPO Platform specialists will collect this information and present it to product teams during Collaboration Cycle meetings.
- Run [foundational accessibility tests](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/guidance/staging-review-processes.md) on their applications, including:
  - Provide documentation in [TestRail](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/index.php?/suites/view/14&group_by=cases:section_id&group_order=asc) or [Github](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/accessibility-test-cases-template.md) certifying tests were run
  - Fix accessibility issues in application code and large changes to static content, including content generated by Drupal or Markdown.
- VFS accessibilty specialists will run additional tests:
  - Staging review guidance for VFS teams with an accessibility specialist **TODO: add link**
  - Post-launch audit guidance for VFS teams with an accessibility specialist **TODO: add link**
- Reduce the backlog of post-launch accessibility improvements over time, as prioritized by their DEPO product lead
