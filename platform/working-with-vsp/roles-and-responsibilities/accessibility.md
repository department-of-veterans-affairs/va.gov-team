# Accessibility

Veteran-facing services (VFS) teams are responsible for ensuring the accessibility of the products. The Digital Experience and Product Office (DEPO) platform supports their work at scale by creating and maintaining VA.gov accessibility standards required for production and by providing guidance as VFS teams work to meet those standards. Code quality -- including meeting [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) compliance ([WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) Level A and AA) -- is the responsibility of each individual VFS team.
