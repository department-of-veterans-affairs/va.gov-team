# Accessibility

Veteran-facing services (VFS) teams are responsible for ensuring the accessibility of the products. The Digital Experience and Product Office (DEPO) platform supports their work at scale by creating and maintaining VA.gov accessibility standards required for production and by providing guidance as VFS teams work to meet those standards. Code quality -- including meeting overall accessibility standards (including both Section 508 and selected WCAG recommendations) -- is the responsibility of each individual VFS team.

## What the DEPO platform provides

* Defines and maintains accessibility standards
* Maintains infrastructure for automated detection of accessibility issues
* Maintains accessibility compliance in common code and libraries
* Conducts accessibility reviews for applications and static content to identify both launch-blocking issues (Severity 0 and Severity 1) as well as other post-launch improvements (deeper dive with more devices, tools)
* Provides support for accessibility questions via Slack and accessibility office hours 

## VFS team responsibilities  

* Ensure their applications and code meet VA.gov accessibility standards.
* Work with the Veteran-facing Services Platform (VSP) team using the [Collaboration Cycle](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/working-with-vsp/vsp-collaboration-cycle) to ensure accessibility standard compliance for:
  * New UI components
  * Changes to existing UI components
  * User flow patterns
  * Larger content changes. (Note: Small changes to static content are not required to go through a full accessibility review via the collaboration cycle, but they are still required to meet VA.gov accessibility standards.)
* Run [foundational accessibility tests](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/508-accessibility-best-practices.md) on their applications, including:
* Provide documentation in [TestRail](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/index.php?/suites/view/14&group_by=cases:section_id&group_order=asc) or [Github](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/accessibility-test-cases-template.md) certifying tests were run.
* Fix accessibility issues in application code and large changes to static content, including content generated by Drupal or Markdown. 
* Reduce the backlog of post-launch accessibility improvements over time, as prioritized by their DEPO product lead.
