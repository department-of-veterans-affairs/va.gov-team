# Information Architecture (IA)
The Digital Experience and Product Office (DEPO) platform team maintains the information architecture of  [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) , including all navigation structures, URL logic, naming conventions for labels, guidance on taxonomies, and general user flows. 
## What the DEPO platform provides
To maintain the information architecture, the DEPO platform provides the following services: 
* Reviews of information architecture for new applications and features, new templates on  [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) , updates to the global navigation design and experience, and user research performed on  [VA.gov](http://va.gov/)  that will result in information architecture changes
* Validation of URL changes requested by VFS (Veteran Facing Services) teams, URL redirects, and vanity URLs
* Documentation and guidance regarding  [VA.gov](http://va.gov/)  information architecture best practices
The DEPO platform team collaborates with VFS teams and DEPO leadership on evaluations and audits of the overall information architecture health of  [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) . This ensures that information remains easy to find for people visiting  [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) , and information places displays appropriately and accurately in search engine results.
The Content Management System (CMS) team (part of the DEPO platform) is responsible for making updates to the global navigation elements that are rendered as part of the Drupal content management system. VFS teams should work directly with the CMS team to implement any changes after their information architecture has been approved by the DEPO platform information architecture team.

* Provide the DEPO platform with sufficient information to determine appropriate location of their work within the larger information architecture of  [VA.gov](http://va.gov/)
