# Time spent with BAH team

We're trying to understand how much time DSVA will need to allocate to "support of external teams."
As a first step, we're collecting data on how much time DSVA and AdHoc people are spending with the BAH pilot team.

Ballpark the number of hours you've spent on **direct support** of the Booz Allen Hamilton team working on 526 ancillary forms.
Don't include hours spent on longer-term activities, e.g., platform changes or internal planning about future process changes.

Direct support includes:
* Answering questions in the [#devsupport-external](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/devsupport-external) channel
* Answering questions via email or phone
* Completing onboarding tasks, e.g., add ssh keys to the authorized list
* DSVA/AdHoc meetings to define a process related to the BAH team
* Sharing background/research/discovery
