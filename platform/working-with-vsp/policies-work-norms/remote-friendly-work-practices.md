# Remote friendly work practices

## Phone calls

- Good mic for room
- One person speaks at a time
- Speak toward the mic
- If there is a note-taker or anyone typing, try to postition them away from the mic
- Leave pauses or specifically solicit input from the remote folks



## Collaborative work

- Remote folks can't read stickies. Tools like mural.io or fun-retro can help.
- Don't have substantive conversations during walk from in-person, back to debrief
