 

# Overview
As of late Oct, 2020, we’re providing the option for anyone on VSP to use personal spaces in Confluence. 

# What is a personal space?
Once you have been provided your Confluence account, you will have your own your Confluence [personal space](https://vfs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VI/pages/579928112/Your+personal+Confluence+space) . You can choose to use this space for drafting documentation by yourself or in collaboration with other team members. You may also come up with other ways you’d like to use your space. At this time, however, the VSP leadership team is not requiring you to create or host anything related to your VSP work in Confluence.

Please remember, at this point, VSP is not using Confluence for any official documentation. If your team needs to share something with a VFS team or with DEPO staff at Veteran’s Affairs, it should reside in GitHub, Slack, E-mail, or a Google Doc.

Please keep in mind that your personal space is visible to any VSP staff member logged in to Confluence by default.

# How do I get and set up my account?
We are adding teams to Confluence one at the time. You will receive an email telling you to sign up, and you’re good to go.

# What about creating documentation for Veteran Facing Service Team (VFS)?
The Content & IA team is going to [pilot](https://app.mural.co/t/adhocvetsgov9623/m/adhocvetsgov9623/1600708778500/1d336f7e070e016d9775ae494146e5cb5c039ad8) our public documentation approach in Q4 2020 to develop an overall public facing documentation approach, standards, and associated tooling. If you’d like to learn about or participate in that pilot, please contact Liani Lye on the Content & IA team.

# Will I have to redo documentation work I put into Confluence later?
Once we settle on a general documentation strategy, including VFS facing and other kinds of documentation, you may need to migrate and adjust documents you created.
