# Detangling Accessibility and QA Responsibilities

## High level division of roles:

- DEPO: define standards
- DEPO Platform: enforce standards
- VFS Teams: meet (and exceed!) standards

## Background

VFS teams are sometimes confused about what the DEPO Platform's standards are: what's required versus desired, and who ultimately gives the "sign off" that the standards are met sufficiently for the team to take their product live. This is largely because we've taken a highly collaborative approach across Platform and VFS accessibility and QA experts to develop process, share workload, and enforce standards. At this point however, the volume of concurrent VFS initiatives is making it such that this organic "blobby" model is creating too much confusion and slow-down. So! We've worked in recent weeks to better define standards, and clarify what the different responsibilities are for Platform experts, and for VFS teams and now itâ€™s time to start aligning to those responsibilities, by detangling VFS accessibility and QA folks from DEPO Platform process, and creating leaner process for the DEPO Platform accessibility and QA folks.

## Action plan

### Accessibility
- [ ] Publish clear standards that the DEPO Platform will enforce
  - [x] Update existing docs
  - [ ] Publicize (ToTs)
- [ ] Clearly separate out guidance content from requirements content in the documentation
  - [ ] Update docs, and share in ToT, so it's clear that VFS teams need to come to the staging review w/their testing and artifacts complete, and the specifics of tasks that fall on VFS, VFS w/SME, vs VSP
  - [ ] Update docs so it's easy for VFS teams to follow the steps necessary to do their required testing and artifacts
- [ ] Create automated dashboard of outstanding 508 issues
- [ ] Remove VFS personnel from governance/enforcement activities and Slack channels
  - [ ] Brief all parties that VSP will deliver feedback in review meetings
  - [ ] Brief all parties that VSP may change the severity of an issue based on our review, and that'll be communicated to the VFS team members as a part of the staging review.
- [ ] Remove DEPO Platfrom personnel from VFS-specific activities
  - [ ] Brief all parties that VFS teams need to alert the VA 508 Office (w/VSP cc'd) once they've launched
- [ ] Do [DEPO Platform workflow evaluation](https://app.mural.co/t/vspproduct9990/m/vspproduct9990/1602273732125/413b2daecfe8e7bccdce52af12ecf518e1f5a695) and cut / adjust steps where possible so the workflow is more manageable

### QA
- [ ] Publish clear standards that the DEPO Platform will enforce
- [ ] Clearly separate out guidance content from requirements content in the documentation
- [ ] Update docs, and share in ToT, so it's clear that VFS teams need to come to the staging review w/their testing and artifacts complete
- [ ] Update docs so it's easy for VFS teams to follow the steps necessary to do their testing and artifacts
- [ ] Remove VFS personnel from governance/enforcement activities and Slack channels 
- [ ] Remove DEPO Platfrom personnel from VFS-specific meetings (if there are any)
- [ ] Do DEPO Platform workflow evaluation and cut / adjust steps where possible so the workflow is more manageable
