# Norms for using tools

## Using Slack

* **Product channel** - Your whole team will be added to a product-focused Slack channel.

  * This where you can ask questions and share **product-related information** with other teams working in a similar area.

* **Support channel** - Your whole team will be added to the *#vfs-platform-support* channel.

  * This is where you can ask **process questions about onboarding, development, deployment, and project management**.

* Refer to [the communication norms](norms-communication.md) for the best way to use Slack to communicate with DSVA and Internal Contractors.


## Understanding Github access

The [VA Github organization](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs) contains many repos from teams across the VA. To make it easier for VFS teams working on the Veteran-facing Services Platform, we've listed the repos that are relevant to your work.

After your team has been added to the VA Github organization (see [requesting access to tools](../onboarding/request-access-to-tools.md), your team will have access to these repos:

* [va.gov-team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team) (public, write access)
    * We'll set up a "Product" folder for your team, which you'll use to store and share product development artifacts.
    * We'll set up a "Teams" folder for your team, which you'll use to store and share internal team documents.
    * Your team will use Github issues in this repo to manage your agile workflow and to request tasks from the DSVA team.
    * __Please review the detailed [guidelines for using the va.gov-team repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/orientation/repo-guidelines.md).__
* [vets-ato](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-ato) (private, read access)
    * Provided so your team can review the current ATO documents.
* [devops](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops) (private, developers have read access)
    * Provided so your team can obtain the ```ssh-config``` file.
