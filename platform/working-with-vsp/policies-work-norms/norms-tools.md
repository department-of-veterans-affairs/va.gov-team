# Norms for using tools

## Using Slack

* **Product channel** - Your whole team will be added to a product-focused Slack channel.

  * This where you can ask questions and share **product-related information** with other teams working in a similar area.

* **Support channel** - Your whole team will be added to the *#vfs-platform-support* channel.

  * This is where you can ask **process questions about onboarding, development, deployment, and project management**.

* Refer to [the communication norms](norms-communication.md) for the best way to use Slack to communicate with DSVA and Internal Contractors.


## Understanding Github access

The [VA Github organization](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs) contains many repos from teams across the VA. To make it easier for VFS teams working on the Veteran-facing Services Platform, we've listed the repos that are relevant to your work.

After your team has been added to the VA Github organization (see [requesting access to tools](../Onboarding/request-access-to-tools.md), your team will have access to these repos:

* [vets.gov-team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team) (private, write access)
    * We'll set up a "Product" folder for your team, which you'll use to store and share project documents.
    * Your team will use Github issues in this repo to manage your agile workflow and to request tasks from the DSVA team.
    * See [using the vets.gov-team repo](#using-the-vetsgov-team-repo).
* [vets-ato](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-ato) (private, read access)
    * Provided so your team can review the current ATO documents.
* [devops](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops) (private, developers have read access)
    * Provided so your team can obtain the ```ssh-config``` file.    
* [vets-website](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website) (public, developers have Write access)
* [vets-api](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api) (public, developers have Write access)
* [vets-json-schema](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-json-schema) (public, developers have Write access)
* [vets-api-mockdata](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-mockdata) (private, developers have Read access)


## Using the vets.gov-team repo

* **Most of the folders in this repo are not relevant or useful to VFS teams.** So please don't get distracted by them!
* **VFS teams only need to pay attention to the "Products" folder.**

### The vets.gov-team Products folder

The "Products" folder contains information about each product (application or feature) on the Veteran-facing Services Platform. Your team will be assigned a "Products" folder (or sub-folder) to work in.

* We encourage you to browse content in other "Products" folders to see how other teams have organized their content or presented their findings.
  * This is especially important if your team is working on adding a feature to an existing application. You'll want to learn the history of the application by seeing what's happened so far.
* Your project may be slightly different, so you don't need to exactly copy what other teams have done. Use your best judgement about what works for your project!
* If you have any questions, ask your DSVA contact.
* For historical and tracking purposes, your team must store its project documents in your assigned "Products" folder. If you don't know which folder that is, ask your DSVA contact.
