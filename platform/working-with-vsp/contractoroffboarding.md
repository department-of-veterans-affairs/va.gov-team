- Your project(s) team lead

2. Please fill out the [Offboarding Request template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=vsp-product-support%2C+operations%2C+Offboarding%2C+analytics-insights&template=offboarding-request.md&title=Offboarding+of+%5Bindividual%5D).

3. Be available to answer any questions the platform team may have.

Other than that, thank you for your service and have an excellent day!
