## Recruiting for Research

1. *The [sample recruiting emails] say that Veterans can email ```feedback@va.gov``` with questions. Who monitors this email and can I get responses sent to it for my recruiting emails?*
    > No. The ```feedback@va.gov``` email address is only for DSVA use. You need to modify the sample recruiting emails to use your own email address, preferably your va.gov email address.

1. *Can I use my own recruiting screener?*
    > No. You must use the [DSVA recruiting screener](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md), which has PRA clearance and an approved OMB control number.

1. *We're planning to recruit Veterans in person at an event (or location). What is the best way to describe who we are to Veterans so that they trust us?*
    > You can say that you work for [your company] who is working on behalf of VA to do this research.<br/>
    If you're handing out printed materials, your va.gov email address will also help legitimize you with the Veteran community.
