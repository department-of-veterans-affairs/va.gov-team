### April 16, 2021

- **Collaboration Cycle Kickoff issue template has been updated** Based off of findings during the first month of the new template in place, the following changes have been made:
   - Examples and/or additional information has been added to the template to help provide context around the question being asked.
   - The questions have been numbered so they're easier to identify (now that there is additional verbiage) and easier to reference.
   - The questions have been reordered to improve the flow.
   - The Analytics question will still be asked, however Domo support is on pause until June 2021.
   - The content and static content questions have been combined and modified for clarity.
