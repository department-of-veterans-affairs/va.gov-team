## Collaboration Cycle - Change Log


### June 28, 2021 
- **Design Intent, Midpoint Review, and Staging Review templates updated.** Templates have been updated to reflect that Staging Reviews can only be scheduled on Thursday during the 1:30pm and 2:00pm time slots. Design Intent and Midpoint Review templates have also been updated to reflect that these touchpoints can only be scheduled on Monday, Tuesday, or Friday.

### June 27, 2021 
- **Design Intent template and touchpoint and readme updated.** Platform accessibility specialists will be temporarily removed from Design Intent’s. Platform accessibility specialists will no longer both support the same Collab Cycle Reviews. The table below has been added to the readme.md file.

### June 7, 2021
- **Contact Center - Product Guide Best Practices has been updated.** The Product Guide Best Practices (aka [Self-Service Product Guide Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/contact-center/self-service-product-guide-template.md)) has been updated to better equip Contact Centers to more swiftly help Veterans trying to complete tasks on VA.gov. For more information about this change, contact the Contact Center team via #vsp-contact-center-support on Slack.

### May 3, 2021
 - **Process changes for Design Intent touchpoint.** The Platform team recognized that the meeting output was not consistent. Platform and OCTO-DE had different expectations of the meeting purpose/objective. The following changes have been put in place to address these inconsistencies:
   - **Asynchronous reviews will no longer be supported.** The Design Intent meeting is intended to be a collaboration between the VFS team, Platform, and OCTO-DE. Collaboration cannot take place if the meeting is asynchronous. 
   - **Platform reviewers will no longer be writing feedback tickets prior to the meeting.** Platform reviewers will now be given the opportunity to hear reasoning behind the design decisions as well as OCTO-DE input prior to creating feedback tickets for VFS teams. This change will allow for improved efficiency with Platform reviewers and less re-writing and editing of tickets post-meeting. Instead...
   - **Feedback tickets will be made available to VFS teams no later than EOD the next business day following the meeting.**
   - **Design Intent issue template has been updated.** A couple additional questions have been added to the template to ask about engagement with OCTO-DE Design Lead and Sitewide Content team. This will help Platform understand the current state and status of the product.
   - **Content feedback will no longer be provided.** Since it is likely that Design Intent is too early for content feedback, and content guidance will be communicated by the Sitewide Content team, Platform will not be providing content feedback at Design Intent. Exceptions may be made if the product is an iteration or if Sitewide Content will not be supporting the product/team.

### April 16, 2021

- **Collaboration Cycle Kickoff issue template has been updated** Based off of findings during the first month of the new template in place, the following changes have been made:
   - Examples and/or additional information has been added to the template to help provide context around the question being asked.
   - The questions have been numbered so they're easier to identify (now that there is additional verbiage) and easier to reference.
   - The questions have been reordered to improve the flow.
   - The Analytics question will still be asked, however Domo support is on pause until June 2021.
   - The content and static content questions have been combined and modified for clarity.

### February 19, 2021

- **Asynchronous Collaboration Cycle Kickoff will replace the Project Kickoff meeting.** Instead of having a Project Kickoff meeting, we’ll ask VFS teams to review the guidance in [Getting Started with the Collaboration Cycle](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/vsp-collaboration-cycle/collab-cycle-get-started.md). This guidance will walk VFS teams through a list of questions to determine what level of support, which practice areas, and which touchpoints are needed for their work. If a team doesn’t know the answer to a question, then it’s too early for them to engage with the Collaboration Cycle. Once teams begin building or iterating on their product, they should submit a [Collaboration Cycle Kickoff](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=andreahewitt-odd%2C+shiragoodman&labels=vsp-product-support%2C+collaboration-cycle%2C+collab-cycle-review&template=collab-cycle-kickoff.md&title=Collaboration+Cycle+Kickoff+%5BTeam+Name%2C+Feature+Name%5D) ticket. This is an asynchronous step and should happen later than a Project Kickoff did.  
- **Usability Testing Prep is now the Midpoint Review.** This touchpoint hasn’t always aligned with usability testing, so we’re renaming it to better suit VFS needs.
- **Weekly Collaboration Cycle office hours.** Starting on Wednesday, February 24, we’ll begin hosting weekly Collaboration Cycle office hours from 11:30-12:00 ET. Meeting Zoom information is listed in the [VSP Collaboration Meetings Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=adhocteam.us_4dn3o77gcm5e3vbiedlha96tc0@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York). 
- **More asynchronous reviews.** VFS teams will now have the option to make Design Intent and Midpoint Review touchpoints asynchronous.
- **Github organization improvements.** We’ve updated the [Collaboration Cycle README](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/working-with-vsp/vsp-collaboration-cycle) so guidance is more findable and intuitive.
- **Issue template updates.** We’ve updated the Collaboration Cycle issue templates to reflect artifact requirements and who’s responsible for which tasks. Major changes can be seen with the Privacy & Security Review and the new Collaboration Cycle Kickoff.
- **Requirements for Full Accessibility and 508 Office Audit.** VFS teams will be required to fix all accessibility defects found at Staging Review before they can request a [Full Accessibility and 508 Office Audit](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/vsp-collaboration-cycle/touchpoint-accessibility-audit.md).
- **Updated communication protocols.** VFS teams should no longer reach out to Platform Collaboration Cycle team members directly for support. This means VFS teams should not assign Platform Collaboration Cycle team members to their Github tickets. See the Contact us section in the [VSP Collaboration Cycle README](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/vsp-collaboration-cycle/README.md) for how to request support from the Collaboration Cycle.
