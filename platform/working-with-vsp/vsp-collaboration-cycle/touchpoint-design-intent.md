# Design Intent
Did we recommend a Design Intent in the Collaboration Cycle Kickoff issue ticket? If so, follow the below guidelines to get started.

## When should I request this touchpoint?
When you have an idea of how to solve the problem and have drafted a low-fidelity prototype and/or wireframe.
## What is the collaboration format?
Synchronous 30-minute meeting
## What is the meeting agenda?
This is the first opportunity for OCTO-DE Practice Area leads and Platform to view your product. You’ll introduce your new work initiative and discuss existing solutions in the problem space. You’ll present your wireframe/prototype and walk through the user flow. Platform and OCTO-DE will then ask questions and provide feedback relevant to the product. 

## What is the objective of this touchpoint?

VFS teams can expect feedback on the user experience and overall design, and guidance on how to meet VA.gov standards.

Both OCTO-DE and Platform use this meeting to gain an early understanding of the product/feature, including the goals/direction of the product, the intended user flow, and the overall scope of the initaitive.
