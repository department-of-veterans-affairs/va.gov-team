# Design Intent
Did we recommend a Design Intent?  If so, follow the below guidelines to get started.
## When should I request this touchpoint?
When you are brainstorming and drafting how you are going to approach your solution. When you have an idea of how to solve the problem.
## What is the collaboration format?
Synchronous 30-minute meeting (recommended), or asynchronous review
## What is the objective of this touchpoint?
Collaborate with VSP to identify any areas that may need additional support.
VSP team: We’ll review your responses to the Collaboration Cycle Kickoff questions. We will share existing design components and research findings relevant to the problem you’re trying to solve.
VFS team: You’ll introduce your new work initiative and discuss existing solutions in the problem space..You’ll  present a draft of ideas to VSP and other expert designers. You’ll also have the opportunity to discuss accessibility considerations with VSP accessibility experts.
We recommend a synchronous meeting for the Design Intent touchpoint since this is the first time you’re introducing VSP to your product and/or iteration. However, if you would like an asynchronous review, VSP will provide feedback on the artifacts you provide to guide VFS teams toward VA.gov platform standards.
