# VSP Collaboration Cycle

The VSP Collaboration Cycle is where VSP reviewers provide support and guidance to VFS teams to help ensure the products they are building on VA.gov meet platform standards.  

VSP provides guidance in Design, Content, Information Architecture, QA, and Accessibility practice areas. Teams should engage with the Collaboration Cycle when they begin building or iterating on their VA.gov content and/or product.

## The Collaboration Cycle process
### 1. Get started with the Collaboration Cycle 
To get your work started in the Collaboration Cycle process, first review the questions and guidance to help determine how the Collaboration Cycle can best support you. 

[Getting started with the Collaboration Cycle](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/vsp-collaboration-cycle/collab-cycle-get-started.md#questions-about-your-product)

This guidance will walk you through a list of questions to determine what level of support, which practice areas and which touchpoints are needed for your work.  If you do not know the answer to a question, then it’s too early for you to engage with the Collaboration Cycle.

### 2. Submit the Collaboration Cycle kickoff ticket
When you’re ready to kick off your Collaboration Cycle process, submit our kickoff ticket. 

[Collaboration Cycle Kickoff ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=andreahewitt-odd%2C+shiragoodman&labels=vsp-product-support%2C+collaboration-cycle%2C+collab-cycle-review&template=collab-cycle-kickoff.md&title=Collaboration+Cycle+Kickoff+%5BTeam+Name%2C+Feature+Name%5D)

Once submitted, VSP will comment on the ticket with the recommended Collaboration Cycle touchpoints, as well as what practice areas will be involved in your reviews. Those recommended touchpoints will also be added to our tracking spreadsheet (linked below) for reference. 

### 3. Prepare for and schedule your touchpoints
When you’re ready to schedule your recommended touchpoints, review the guidelines outlined in each of the touchpoints below to prepare. Then use our VSP Collaboration Meeting Calendar (linked below) to find a time.
