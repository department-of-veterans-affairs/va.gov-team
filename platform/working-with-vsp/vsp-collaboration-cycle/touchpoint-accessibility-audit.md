# Full Accessibility and 508 Office Audit

Did we recommend a Full Accessibility and 508 Office Audit in the Collaboration Cycle Kickoff issue ticket? If so, follow the below guidelines to get started.

## When should I request this touchpoint?

Schedule a full audit when your product is launched to production, when code is relatively stable. All accessibility defects that were identified at Staging Review must be fixed before requesting a full audit.* **Note:** This touchpoint should be scheduled as early as possible. 

_*Platform understands that other teams may be accountable for fixing the defects identified at Staging Review. These defects are exempt and will not block a team from scheduling this touchpoint._

## What is the collaboration format?

Asynchronous review

## What is the objective of this touchpoint?

Accessibility experts complete a full accessibility audit and coordinate with the VAâ€™s 508 office for feedback and approval. Review the [accessibility post-launch audit processes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/guidance/post-launch-audit-processes.md) document for more information.
