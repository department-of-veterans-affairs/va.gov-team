# Getting started with the Collaboration Cycle 
Before engaging with the Collaboration Cycle, please review the guidance and questions below to help Platform determine what level of support, which practice areas, and which touchpoints are needed for your work. If you don’t know the answer to a question, then it’s too early for you to engage with the Collaboration Cycle.

**Are you ready to engage with the Collaboration Cycle?**

If yes, then a VFS Product Manager should submit a ticket for an asynchronous [Collaboration Cycle Kickoff](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=andreahewitt-odd%2C+shiragoodman&labels=vsp-product-support%2C+collaboration-cycle%2C+collab-cycle-review&template=collab-cycle-kickoff.md&title=Collaboration+Cycle+Kickoff+%5BTeam+Name%2C+Feature+Name%5D). We'll respond in the GitHub ticket with the recommended Collaboration Cycle touchpoints, as well as any other additional information the team should know.

## Questions about your product
These questions will help Platform learn more about your product and determine which practice areas and touchpoints are needed for your work.

### 1. Will your work result in visible changes to the user experience?

Examples of **visible changes** include:
 - Any changes that the user will see
 - Adding a new form, tool, or page
 - Modifying buttons, design elements, interactions, or page layouts
 - Reordering content, adding new calls to action, alert boxes, expandable sections, or error messages

Examples of **no visible changes** include:
 - Changes to code that the user won’t see
 - Changes to accessible labels. These might include aria-label, aria-labelledby, aria-describedby

### 2. Is your work a new product/feature or an iteration to an existing product/feature?

Examples of a **new** product/feature include:
 - Migrating over a paper form that has new design components
 - Creating a new design component to a page layout
 - Adding new functionality to an existing tool that is completely new to VA.gov

Examples of an **iteration** to an existing product/feature include:
 - Modifying or adding functionality, an interaction, or content to an existing page
 - Adding additional form fields or interactions to an existing online form
 - Re-organizing content (adding headings, subheadings, new paragraph order)

### 3. Are you making changes to the visual design?
We ask this question to determine if design should be involved in your Collaboration Cycle reviews and if a Contact Center Review is necessary.

Examples of **changes to the visual** design include:
 - Any changes to design components, buttons, layout, or patterns
 - Any changes to colors, icons, or typography

Examples of **no changes to the visual** design include:
 - Code-only changes

### 4. Are you doing research with VA.gov users?
We ask this question to determine if a Research Plan Review is necessary.

Examples of **research with VA.gov users** include:
 - Usability testing
 - User surveys
 - Card sorting

### 5. Will your work include content changes for: 
- Tools and applications*
- Static pages
- This work doesn’t involve content changes.

*For tools and applications, take into account if any content on static page entry points will need updates.

Content changes could include: updates to buttons, links, labels, headings, reordering content, or adding error messages.

### 6. Are you making a change to the user flow?
We ask questions 6 and 7 to determine if IA should be involved in your Collaboration Cycle reviews and if a Contact Center Review and/or a separate IA Request is necessary.

Examples of **changes to the user flow** include:
 - Adding a new section to a form 
 - Moving from a wizard to one thing per page form model

### 7. Are there any changes to urls, navigation, or entry points?

Examples of **changes to url, navigation, or entry points** include:
 - Moving an online tool or content page within the site or needing to retire/redirect a page
 - Modifying options within core navigation elements (for example, top nav, left nav, home page)

### 8. Does your product/feature have Google Analytics tracking ~and a KPI dashboard in Domo~?
### 9. If yes, do you need to capture any other analytics or metrics in addition to what you're currently tracking?

We ask these questions to determine if Analytics will need to be involved in your Collaboration Cycle reviews, and if an Analytics Request is necessary.

**Please note that Domo is on Pause until end of June. See [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/DEPO/team-wide-messages/analytics-services-paused-for-infra-work.md) for more information. Google Analytics tracking support will still be provided.**
