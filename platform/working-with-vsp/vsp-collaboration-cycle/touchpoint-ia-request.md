# Information Architecture (IA) Request

Did we recommend an IA Request? If so, follow the below guidelines to get started.

## When should I request this touchpoint?
After Design Intent, when you’re beginning to understand the user flow.

## What is the collaboration format?
Asynchronous collaboration and review

## What is the objective of this touchpoint?
Collaborate with VSP’s Information Architect to finalize where your product/feature will live within the overall VA.gov IA. This includes reviewing entry points, user flows, breadcrumbs, URL, and other key details before developing in staging. 

VSP’s Information Architect has a high-level view of the entire VA.gov experience and can help ensure that your new or updated content fits well in that ecosystem.

## How do I request this touchpoint?
VFS Product Manager submits an [IA Request ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=mnorthuis%2C+shiragoodman&labels=vsp-product-support%2C+collaboration-cycle%2C+collab-cycle-review&template=ia-request.md&title=IA+Request+%5BTeam-Name%2C+Feature-Name%5D).
