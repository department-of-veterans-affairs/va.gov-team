# Information Architecture (IA) Request

Did we recommend an IA Request in the Collaboration Cycle kick-off issue? If so, follow the below guidelines to get started.

## When should I request this touchpoint?
The IA Request should be opened as soon as you receive a response to your Collaboration Cycle kick-off ticket that indicates Information Architect Request is needed.  This ensures IA can be discussed and established as early as possible in the design process and allows time for collaboration with any other teams that are identified as needed support for static content and entry points such as Sitewide content or CMS. 

## What is the collaboration format?
Asynchronous collaboration and review. 

## What is the objective of this touchpoint?
Collaborate with VSP’s Information Architect to finalize where your product/feature will live within the overall VA.gov IA. This includes reviewing entry points, user flows, breadcrumbs, URL, and other key details before developing in staging. 

VSP’s Information Architect has a high-level view of the entire VA.gov experience and can help ensure that your new or updated content fits well in that ecosystem.

## How do I request this touchpoint?
VFS Product Manager submits an [IA Request ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=mnorthuis%2C+shiragoodman&labels=vsp-product-support%2C+collaboration-cycle%2C+collab-cycle-review&template=ia-request.md&title=IA+Request+%5BTeam-Name%2C+Feature-Name%5D).

## What artifacts do I provide?
VFS brings: 
- Link to product outline 
- Link to or attach prototype or mockups
- Link to or attach user/page flows
- Link to or attach your content source of truth, including H1s (if separate from prototype/mockup)
- Completed information architecture worksheet in the IA Request template (Optional)

## What is the outcome of this touchpoint?
VSP provides a finalized information architecture recommendation, including IA structure, URLs, breadcrumbs, navigation changes, and entry and exit points. Redirect guidance is also included, if applicable.
