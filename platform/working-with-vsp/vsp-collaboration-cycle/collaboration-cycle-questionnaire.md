# Collaboration Cycle Questionnaire
VSP has created a series of questions for VFS teams to answer early on in their build. These questions help to ensure VFS teams are getting support from the practice areas relevant to their initiative and also help determine which Collaboration Cycle touchpoints are recommended and/or required.

These questions will be asked to the VFS team at their Collaboration Cycle kickoff. VSP will respond in the Github ticket with the recommended Collaboration Cycle touchpoints, as well as any other additional information the team should know.
