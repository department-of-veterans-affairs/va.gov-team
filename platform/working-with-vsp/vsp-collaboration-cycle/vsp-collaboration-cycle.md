# VSP Collaboration Cycle

So you’re starting a new project — congratulations! This is a guide to required Veteran-facing Services Platform (VSP) collaboration points, written for all Veteran-facing Services (VFS) teams building on VA.gov. VSP’s mission is to provide a framework comprised of systems, tools, processes, documentation, and customer support, that helps VFS Teams create successful VA.gov products.

The VSP Collaboration Cycle was created for medium-to-large VFS work initiatives. Not sure if this process applies to your project? Not sure how your edge case fits in? Ask us in #vfs-platform-support and we’d be happy to help customize a plan!
