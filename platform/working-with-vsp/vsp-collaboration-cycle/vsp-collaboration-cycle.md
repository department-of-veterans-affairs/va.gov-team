# VSP Collaboration Cycle

So you’re starting a new project — congratulations! This is a guide to required Veteran-facing Services Platform (VSP) collaboration points, written for all Veteran-facing Services (VFS) teams building on VA.gov. VSP’s mission is to provide a framework comprised of systems, tools, processes, documentation, and customer support, that helps VFS Teams create successful VA.gov products.

The VSP Collaboration Cycle was created for medium-to-large VFS work initiatives. Not sure if this process applies to your project? Not sure how your edge case fits in? Ask us in [#vfs-platform-support](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/vfs-platform-support) and we’d be happy to help customize a plan!

- One month after "Go Live" (as defined in Release Plan - [template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/product-management/release-plan-template.md))

## Collaboration format: asynchronous

### Request Process

### Artifact inputs
You bring: 
- Completed [Release Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/product-management/release-plan-template.md) with results populated, including answers written to the `Post-launch Questions` at the bottom

### Outcomes and artifact outputs
