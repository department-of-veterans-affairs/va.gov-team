# Midpoint Review
Did we recommend a Midpoint Review? If so, follow the below guidelines to get started.
## When should I request this touchpoint?
When you have determined your initial solution approach and have prototypes or mockups ready for usability testing. Before you begin recruiting research participants and scheduling sessions.

## What is the collaboration format?
Synchronous 30-minute meeting (recommended), or asynchronous review

## What is the objective of this touchpoint?
VSP reviewers will confirm that your prototypes or mockups are consistent with existing patterns and standards. They’ll provide feedback to help ensure your product is ready for successful usability testing.

We recommend a synchronous meeting if this is the first time you’re introducing VSP to your product and/or iteration. However, if you would like an asynchronous review, VSP will provide feedback on the artifacts you provide to guide VFS teams toward VA.gov platform standards.
