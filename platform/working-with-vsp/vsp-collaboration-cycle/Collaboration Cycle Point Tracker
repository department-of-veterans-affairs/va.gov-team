# **Collaboration Cycle Point Tracker**

You're starting a new project and using the Collaboration Cycle, congrats! One of the first steps in getting your project started is adding your project to the Collaboration Cycle Point Tracker. This tracker was put in place to help keep track of which point within the Collaboration Cycle each team/project is in. It is important that you add your project to the tracker as many different review groups rely on this tracker to help identify and plan for the next step for your project.

## How to Add Your Team and/or Project
1. Navigate to the Point Tracker found here: [Point Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d219oL1zCvCvnv1Bx-dI-GMzwgbarLv9_bzMSa3ULjA/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Copy the team header cells and in the event you are also adding a project, copy the following project template as well. If you are only adding a project, select only those fields. 
3. Find the appropriate place to add your team, default to to the bottom of the page if you aren't sure, and paste in the template. If you are only adding a project, find the appropriate team header and add your project to the bottom of that list by adding the appropriate rows or inserting (not pasting) the rows.
4. Fill out all appropriate fields for your team/project.
