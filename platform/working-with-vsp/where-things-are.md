# Where things are (for external developers)


### Veteran Tools Platform (VTP)
[See image for where we're going](where-things-are.png)

External teams **working on the VTP** should only have to remember these locations:

1. Handbook
    * Technical Guide contains links to high-level end-to-end developer/agile workflow and process, which links to specific documents needed to complete some of the tasks
    * Design Guide contains link to design-system website
1. "something-team" repo contains the external team's "Products" folder and is where they file issues to request something from DSVA
1. Code repos (website, api, json-schema, mockdata, ato) - technically they don't have to "remember" these locations - they're linked to from the Technical Guide



### VA wide developer content

External teams **working on VA wide projects** should only have to remember this location:
1. developer.va.gov - currently only contains the VA APIs documentation
    * Can be expanded in future to include other documentation for **VA-wide** tools or services. 
    * VTP content should not live here. The site suggests that whatever is there is VA wide. Developer documentation for VTP is specific to VTP.
    * If it is not confusing to developers looking for VA wide dev documentation, we can put a link on developer.va.gov that sends people to the Handbook (with a note that it's specific to VTP and includes the whole process).
