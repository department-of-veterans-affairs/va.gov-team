# ATO and Security

## POV - Security Review

Some concern expressed around ensuring the security of work produced by external teams.

### Decision made Sep 13, 2018 by Alex L and Liz Hunt

> Note: The process below is a short-term solution pending research/discovery about contractor responsibility/liability around security and ATO.

#### We *will not* create a new/different process for external contractors. We will rely on the existing processes we already use for reviewing code:

* External contractors request code reviews as part of their normal development workflow.
* External contractors submit code that is checked by our automated tools. They’re not able to merge code until their code passes.
* DSVA requests WASA (Web Application Security Assessment) security reviews periodically throughout the year.
  * WASA is the official VA mechanism for security reviews.
  * DSVA requests at least one WASA review per year when we re-certify our ATO.
 
With these three processes, we think we’re in good shape: no need for additional/new/different process for external developers.
