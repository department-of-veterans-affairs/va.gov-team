# Zenhub

Zenhub is the main issue tracking tool used by VSP. An intro to Zenhub can be found [here](https://help.zenhub.com/support/solutions/articles/43000010778-what-is-zenhub-an-intro-to-zenhub-in-github).

It may be useful to see Zenhub as a layer of data that sits on top of github issues and offers additional functionality and features.

The difference between a github issue and a Zenhub issue is further described in the [Zenhub documentation](https://help.zenhub.com/support/solutions/articles/43000458338-what-is-zenhub-vs-github-in-an-issue).

## Zenhub onboarding

To start using Zenhub, you can follow the onboarding process described here:
* [Zenhub onboarding](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/orientation/zenhub_onboarding.pdf)

### Requesting a Zenhub license

If after following the onboarding instructions above, you see a screen like the below stating "You have not been assigned a license; Contact an admin to request access", 

![zenhub license request](zenhub-license-request.png)

try to click the button to request a license, then wait 1 business day for access to be granted.

If after 1 day, Zenhub still doesn't work, please create a new thread in [#vfs-platform-support](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CBU0KDSB1) and ping @admins-zenhub to request that they grant your license. Please provide your github username so they can process the request.

## Product management with Zenhub

The product management process for Zenhub is described here:
* [Product Management Process in Zenhub](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/orientation/zenhub_product_management.pdf)
 
## Zenhub administration
 
 If you are a Zenhub administrator, you can use the following steps to approve license requests:
 1. Go to https://app.zenhub.com/dashboard/o/department-of-veterans-affairs/manage
 2.  Hit "assign all"
 3. Follow the additional 1-2 steps to "purchase" the licenses
 
 Note: this will make you feel nervous because it seems like you're shelling out money for something. But you're not. We have a forever unlimited free licenses setup with ZenHub. So, though it feels like you're spending money, the card on file will not be charged for the additional licenses.
