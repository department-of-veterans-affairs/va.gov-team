# Documentation Best Practices at VA.gov

_Last updated: July 17, 2019_

Documentation is an integral part of working on the VA Platform. This document is a guide containing standards and best practices for how documentation is written and maintained as well as the expectations for new documentation creation and organization.

- **Archive Folder**: a *special* folder that can be created/exist within any folder as a place for storing files that are out of date (no longer relevant)
- **If you find something out of date - update or archive**: everyone should feel empowered to make updates or move any file. We want our documentation to stay as up to date/relevant as possible. When you find something that's no longer accurate, make a change or notify someone.
- **Write descriptive but concise commit messages**: when a change is made in Github, it is accompanied by a commit message. Please do your best to write clear commit messages to help others understand what changes were made to each file.
- **Take time to find the right place to put new files**: things get unwieldy when files are put in the wrong place. Save time down the line, by taking time to identify the right directory to create new files.
- **Consolidate when possible**: there will be times when files are duplicated in differing places. As a team we should all do our best to find opportunities to consolidate files when possible.
- **Always link to the README.md**: when you're trying to direct team members to the instructions within a directory - linking to the README avoid all of the clutter of the folders up top.
- **Write descriptive, readable titles for your documents**: Avoid naming your documents by date or number. Instead, give documents titles that are logical and readable by humans. Separate the words with dashes. It's okay if they get a little long! For example: [tools-for-getting-started-with-the-us-forms-system.md](https://github.com/usds/us-forms-system/blob/master/docs/getting-started/tools-for-getting-started-with-the-us-forms-system.md)
- **Fix errors you find**: Maintaining healthy documentation requires everyone to pitch in. If you find a broken link, or any other type of error, do what you can to fix it yourself or track down someone who can help.
- **Write a product outline for each product you build**: It's important for anyone who visits a product folder to be able to understand the context, goals, and points of contact of that product. Put the product outline content into the README of the product folder. [Use this template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/product-management/product-outline-template.md) as a guide to writing your product outlines.
- **Create a consistent product folder structure**: Each product folder should organize the work into the following folders: Discovery, Research, Design, and Content. [Needs validation from a PM]
