# GFE Requests

GFE's (Government-furnished equipment) are not issued for everyone on VSP, but some individuals do use them. For everyone who doens't have a GFE, we use CAG for remote access to the VA network (email, ServiceNow, etc).

## Requests

A request for a GFE should go through your practice lead.
