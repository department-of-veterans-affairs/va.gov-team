# **SharePoint Upload Process**

Below is the process for uploading VA.gov product guides and videos to the VEO Contact Center SharePoint site. The following process begins after Contact Center review:

The approved product guide and video will be uploaded to the SharePoint site by a member of the VA.gov team.

* - The video and guide will be uploaded to separate designated folders.
      - VEO Contact Center > Training Files > KM Docs
* A member of the VA.gov team will send an email to the designated individuals, informing them of the recent upload.
     * - Adeyemi, Dorian A. Dorian.Adeyemi@va.gov
     * - Scipione, Michael Michael.Scipione@va.gov
     * - Unger, Todd Todd.Unger@va.gov
     * - VEOCC Training VEOCC_Training@va.gov
* Once the VEO team has uploaded the guides and videos to SalesForce, the items will be moved to archive folders.

Version control and sharing information with agents will be the responsibility of the VEO team. If a product guide or video is modified, the process will remain the same.
