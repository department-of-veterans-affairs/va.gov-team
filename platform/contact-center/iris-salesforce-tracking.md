# IRIS and SalesForce Tracking

## Current State

There are multiple spreadsheets that are being used by both Contact Center Leads in order to gather issues from SalesForce and IRIS.  
This causes issues when attempting to compile data for tracking and reporting purposes.  Although issues are being gathered from two 
seperate systems, the criteria is the similar. 

Upon final determination of which master spreadsheet will be utilized for compiling data, the following process will be used for 
tracking issues from IRIS and SalesForce.

Contact Center Leads will gather issues on a daily basis from IRIS and SalesForce and enter into the master spreadsheet located on 
the O drive of the VA Network.  

## The information that will be collected:

- Ticket numbers
- Origination ticket date
- System (i.e. IRIS or Salesforce)
- Name of employee handling issue
- Status
- Users last name
- Description/Case notes 
- Topic
- Subtopic


Once the information is entered into the master spreadsheet it will be the responsibility of the Contact Center Leads to follow the escalation process in order to advise the appropriate teams of known issues.
