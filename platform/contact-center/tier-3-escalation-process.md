## Tier 3 Issues and Priority Definitions

Tier 3 issues are persistent bugs that the VSP Contact Center Team has investigated and determined to be caused by a technical failure that cannot be resolved with standard scripts and troubleshooting steps. The VSP Contact Center Team identifies Tier 3 issues through triage work in IRIS, Salesforce, and notifications from VA contact center POCs.

Once a Tier 3 are also assigned a priority based on the following criteria:

  * **Low:** Fewer than 10 total reported issues and a viable work around exists
  * **Medium:** Fewer than 10 total reported issues and no viable work around exists
  * **High:** 10 or more total reported issues. 
  * **Urgent:** 10 or more reported issues in one day. This is considered a trending issue for VA.gov contact centers. 

## Assigning Issues
Once an issue has been triaged and identified as Tier 3, the VSP Contact Center team will determine which VFS team is responsible and will create a github issue. The github issue will include the following information:

* **Issue Title:** Brief description of issue
    * Ex. Logon to ID.me error message
* **Labels:** Contact Center, Analytics and Insights, and the label for the VFS team responsible for handling the issue.
* **Assignees:** All VSP Contact Center Team members will be assigned as well as the PM of the identified VFS team. 
    * If the VSP Contact Center Team member is unsure of who the ticket should be assigned to, then it will be assigned to the Back End Tools Team for triage.
* **Issue Details:** The following information about the Tier 3 issue will be included in the body of the github issue. If there are multiple examples of the bug, a spreadsheet with the below information will be created and attached to the ticket.
  * Date issue reported
  * Source of the issue and ticket number (i.e. IRIS, VEO Tier 1 Contact Center, HRC, etc)
  * Priority designation (i.e. low, medium, high, urgent)
  * Detailed description of the problem as stated by the customer and any subsequent information gathered by the VSP Contact Center Team
  * Topic and Sub-topic of the issue

**NO PII WILL BE INCLUDED.** If PII is needed for further investigation, the VFS team must request it. Any PII will be sent via encrypted email or other secure delivery channel. 

## Setting Up a Video Chat with a User
If a VFS team determines it needs to speak and observe the user to investigate the issue, notify the VSP Contact Center Team and they will work with you to find a suitable time and method to speak with the affected user(s).  

## Response and Resolution Time
The VSP Contact Center Team works directly with affected users and VA contact center stakeholders to resolve Tier 3 issuse and bugs. This is why the VSP Contact Center Team has set timelines for an initial response to the issue as well as issue resolutions. 

Once a Tier 3 issue has been assigned to a VFS team, the VSP Contact Center Team will expect a response within **48 business hours** acknowledging the receipt of the issue, concurrence or nonconcurrence on the assignment of the issue, any immediate ideas for troubleshooting and/or work arounds, and an estimated date for a resolution/update. The VSP Contact Center Team needs a status update in order to determine the issue has been assigned to the right team and report back to VA contact center stakeholders and affected user(s).

Based on the priority of the ticket, the VSP Contact Center Team will also expect a final resolution or a comprehensive update on the following timeline: 

  * **Low:** Resolution within 30 days
  * **Medium:** Resolution within 15 days
  * **High:** Resolution within 7 days
  * **Urgent:** Resolution within 48 hours

*Note:* The VSP Contact Center Team realizes VFS teams have dependencies for investigating issues, including VA systems and teams. If an investigation or resolution is blocked because of a dependency on the part of another VA team, please notify the VSP Contact Center Team so they can escalate the issue through the necessary customer experience channels. 
  
#### Status Requests
If a VSP Contact Center team member has not received an initial response from the VFS team within the first 48 business hours or a final resolution or update by the designated time based on priority, the VSP Contact Center team member will escalate the issue to the PM of the team that has been assigned the issue. 

## Issue Resolution
The VSP Contact Center Team will be responsible for closing the github issue. The following criteria must be met for an issue to be closed:
 * Resolution has been identified and implemented
 * VSP Contact Center Team has communicated resolution to user(s) affected

If a resolution cannot be found because of a permanent blocker, the VSP Contact Center Team will communicate this to the user and the issue will be labeled blocked and remain open. 

If a user responds to resolution communication that they are still experiencing the issue, the github issue will be reopened. 

## When to engage the VSP Contact Center Team
  
**General Rule:** The VSP Contact Center team will make every effort to include ALL pertinent infromation on the issue.  However, if more details are needed...
- Find the appropriate github ticket relating to the issue
- @ all VSP Contact Center team members to be notified 
- Enter in all details or questions concerning the issue
  - Not all customers are fluent in technical terms. Please attempt to use layman terminology for best responses
  - Be as detailed as possible to prevent or lessen multiple interactions with the user which will only cause frustration
- A VSP Contact Center team member will reach out to the user within 24 hours of the request
