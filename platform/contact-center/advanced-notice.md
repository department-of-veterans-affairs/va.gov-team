External Contact Centers are the front line, therefore it is imperative that design, product, etc. teams inform us of any new releases 
or bug fixes that may cause an influx of inquiries.

In order to prepare external Contact Centers with the information that they require, please do the following:

- Advise the Contact Center team as soon as possible.  The more advance notice the better.
   - This will allow us to give advance notice to external Contact Centers
   - Additional information or clarification may be requested from external Contact Centers
- Create a ZH ticket with ALL information and details that would be beneficial for a Contact Center agent to have to effectively 
assist the customer.
   - Issue Title: Brief description of bug fix or release, etc.
   - Label: Contact Center
   - Assignees: All Contact Center team members and individuals associated with the bug fix, new release, etc.
   - Comments: Enter description in this area.
- The Contact Center team will review the ticket within 72 business hours
   - Any questions will be entered into the comments section 
   - @ all assignees listed in the ticket
- If clarification cannot take place within the ZH ticket, a conference call will be scheduled with all assigees for resolution.
