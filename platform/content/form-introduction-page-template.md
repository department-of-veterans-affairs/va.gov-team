## Form Introduction Page 

This is a high-level description of the introduction page for form benefit applications. 

## What's the purpose of the Form Introduction page?

This page gives users step-by-step information on how to apply for a benefit. It also sets clear expectations on when they can expect a decision on their application. This page also gives users ways to get help, as well as important information about that specific form or benefit.  

Users can navigate to a form’s introduction page either from within VA.gov or through an online search. Since users can navigate to this page from outside VA.gov, it's recommended that this page include some basic benefit eligibility information or a link back to the VA.gov benefit eligibility page.

## Subway map/Process list

Subway map, or [process list](https://design.va.gov/components/process-list), describes the steps the user should take to apply. The headings start with action words and are short/concise. We’ve made these consistent across forms. 

**Prepare**

This steps tells the user what they need to fill out the form (Social Security number, bank information, military history, spouse information, etc).  This bullet can also include some basic eligibility information or a link back to the VA.gov benefit eligibility page.

**To fill out this application, you’ll need your:**

* [example] Your Social Security number 
* [example] copy of DD214
* 
{optional}
**[If you have a conditional situation] You may also need:**
- Loreum upsem
- Loreum upsem


**Apply**

The is standard langauge we use across forms: 
Complete this [benefits] form. After submitting the form, you’ll get a confirmation message. You can print this page for your records.

**What if I need help filling out my application?**

An accredited representative, like a Veterans Service Officer (VSO) can [help you fill out your claim](https://www.va.gov/disability/get-help-filing-claim/).

**VA review**

The step tells applicants how much time it takes VA to review their application.  The content under this heading depends on what type of benefit an applicant is applying for.

Some examples: 

[Health care benefits form intro page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction) *We process health care claims within a week.*

[Education forms intro page](https://www.va.gov/education/apply-for-education-benefits/application/1990/introduction) *We usually process claims within 30 days. We’ll let you know by mail if we need more information.*

[Disability compensation intro page](https://www.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/introduction) *We process applications in the order we receive them. We may contact you if we have questions or need more information.  The amount of time it takes to review your claim depends on:*
- Loreum upsem
- Loreum upsem
- Loreum upsem

**Decision**

This step tells users when they'll be informed about the status of their application (if denied or approved) and the next steps.
It also sets the user’s expectation for how long it takes to receive a response.

## Other optional components on the introduction page

### Alert boxes (optional)

Depending on the type of benefit, we sometimes include an [informational alert box](https://design.va.gov/components/alertboxes) with specific information about that benefit. 

This is an optional component and should only be used if there is important benefit or part of the application process to call out to the applicant.
