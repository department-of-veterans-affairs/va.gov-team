### <a id="whatwedo"></a> What we do

VSP Content provides guidance and feedback on all content being created across VA.gov to ensure it follows our content style guide, such as: 

-	[ ] [Voice](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/content-principles.html): Does the content balance the voice between friendly and formal and sounds approachable and supportive? The VA.gov voice should be consistent across all our communications and is direct, transparent, dedicated, and human.

-	[ ] [Tone](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/content-principles.html): Does the content come across as harsh or intimidating? Even when discussing a serious topic, the tone should be gentle and compassionate. The tone may vary based on the material’s content, the context, and the reader’s likely emotional state.

-	[ ] [Plain-language best practices](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/content-principles.html): Is the content written in active voice and present tense? Ensure that the content isn’t too “wordy” or uses excessive modifying words (e.g, “really, completely, totally,” etc.)

-	[ ] [Grammar and style guide check](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/): The review will also include a grammar check (look for typos, misspellings, and punctuation/spacing errors) and style guide check (ensure content adheres to the VA.gov style guide).


### <a id="workingwithus"></a> Working with us

The [VSP Collaboration Cycle](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/working-with-vsp/vsp-collaboration-cycle) defines the process for VSP support of VFS teams to ensure that products and services on VA.gov are human-centered, reliable, and continually improving.

Content feedback and guidance happens during the following Collaboration Cycle check-ins: 

- **Project Kickoff:** During the kickoff, we'll get a better understanding of the problem your team is trying to solve. Engaging content  as early as possible in your work will provide us with background information, and well as help us understand scope, audience, and timing. We'll also be able to identity if there are any areas of your project that might need additional support or collaboration. 

- **Usability Testing Prep:** We’ll review prototypes or mockups to ensure they’re consistent with existing content style and guidance. We can also attend research sessions to help better understand what areas of your product might need extra content review or support.

- **Staging:** We’ll provide content feedback on your completed product on staging it’s launched. During this stage we’ll do a full E2E content review and a final proofread to ensure content recommendations we provided earlier in the process are accurate and correct. We'll also work closely with IA to ensure accurate page labels and placement.
