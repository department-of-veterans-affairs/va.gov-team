### <a id="whatwedo"></a> What we do

VSP Content provides guidance and feedback on content being created across VA.gov to ensure it follows our content best practices, such as: 

-	[ ] [Voice](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/content-principles.html): Does the content balance the voice between friendly and formal and sounds approachable and supportive? The VA.gov voice should be consistent across all our communications and is direct, transparent, dedicated, and human.

-	[ ] [Tone](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/content-principles.html): Does the content come across as harsh or intimidating? Even when discussing a serious topic, the tone should be gentle and compassionate. The tone may vary based on the material’s content, the context, and the reader’s likely emotional state.

-	[ ] [Plain-language best practices](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/content-principles.html): Is the content written in active voice and present tense? Ensure that the content isn’t too “wordy” or uses excessive modifying words (e.g, “really, completely, totally,” etc.)

-	[ ] [Grammar and style guide check](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/): The review will also include a grammar check (look for typos, misspellings, and punctuation/spacing errors) and style guide check (ensure content adheres to the VA.gov style guide).


### <a id="workingwithus"></a> Working with us

The [VSP Collaboration Cycle](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/working-with-vsp/vsp-collaboration-cycle) defines the process for VSP support of all VFS teams to ensure that products and services on VA.gov are human-centered, reliable, and continually improving.

VSP provides content feedback and guidance during the following Collaboration Cycle touchpoints: 

- **Collaboration Cycle Kickoff:** This is an asynchronous step where we'll get a better understanding of the problem your team is trying to solve. During this step, Collaboration Cycle reviewers will also be able to identity if there are any areas of your project that might need additional support or collaboration. 

- **Midpoint Review:** We’ll review mockup or prototypes to ensure they’re consistent with existing content style and guidance. 

- **Staging Review:** We’ll provide feedback on your completed product on staging before it’s launched. During this touchpoint, it's recommended that we do a full E2E content review to ensure content recommendations provided earlier in the process are accurate and correct, as well as ensure any static pages that support the tool are updated. We'll also work closely with IA to ensure accurate page labels and placement.
