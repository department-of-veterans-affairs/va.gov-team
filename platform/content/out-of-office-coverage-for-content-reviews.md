# Out of office coverage plan for Platform content reviews


1. VSP Platform content editor (Peggy) to provide all product teams with as much notice as possible for planned PTO time. 

2. VSP Platform content editor will work though content reviews (depending on priority and complexity) ahead of planned PTO time. The goal is to complete all in-flight content review requests before going out of office. 

3. If a submitted content review requires an additional review that would fall during PTO time, Peggy will work with VSP Product Support PM to designate a backup reviewer. 

4. If a product team submits a content review during Peggy’s PTO time, VSP Product Support PM will work with the requesting team to determine the timeline of the review. For reviews that can’t wait until Peggy returns, PM will designate another VSP team member to do the review. 


## Process for requesting a content review during VSP Platform content editor PTO

1. Product team assigns content review ticket to VSP Product Support PM. 

2. VSP Product Support PM will work with the requesting team to determine timeline of the review, and if this review needs to be completed before Peggy returns.
