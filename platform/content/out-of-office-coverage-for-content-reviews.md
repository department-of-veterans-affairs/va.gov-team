# Out of office coverage plan for Platform content reviews


1. VSP Platform content editor (Peggy) to provide all product teams with as much notice as possible for planned PTO time (at least 2 weeks). 

2. Platform content editor will work though content reviews (depending on priority and complexity) ahead of planned PTO time. The goal is to complete all submitted content review requests before going out of office. 

3. If a submitted content review requires an additional review that would fall during PTO time, Peggy will discuss with Kara Kemahli and Jen Lee (VSA public-websites) to see if a member of that content team could do the follow-up review. 

4. If a product team submits a content review during Peggy’s PTO time, Megan Kelley (VSP Content & I/A PM) will work with the requesting team to determine the timeline of the review. For reviews that can’t wait until Peggy returns, Megan will work with Kara Kemahli and Jen Lee to see if a member of VSA public-websites content team could do the review. 


## Process for requesting a content review during Platform content editor PTO

1. Product team assigns content review ticket to Megan Kelley (VSP Content & I/A PM). 

2. Megan will work with the requesting team to determine timeline of the review, and if this review needs to be completed before Peggy returns. 

3. If the content review needs to be completed before Peggy is back in the office, Megan will work with Kara Kemahli and Jen Lee to determine if anyone on the VSA public-websites team is available to do the review. 

4. Megan will assign the content review to the available VSA public-websites team member. Megan will remain “assigned” to the issue until the content review is completed and the issue is closed. This is to ensure that a Platform member can assist if follow up is needed. This will also allow Megan to debrief Peggy appropriately when she returns to the office.
