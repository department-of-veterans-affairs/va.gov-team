## Overview

The Service Blueprint visualizes pain points and successes along the typical VFS team user journey.

## Problem Statement

Today, there is no way to visualize the end-to-end VFS team user journey which means VSP teams may not understand how the features and services they are providing impact the broader customer experience.

VSP do not have a single place tto go to see high-level view of pain points across the platform so they cannot ensure they are prioritizing the highest value work.

Leads to disjointed overall customer experience and leaves certain fustrating pain points unresolved.

*How might we enable VSP teams to see pain points and successes across the end-to-end experience of VFS teams on the platform.*

## Desired User Outcomes

VSP team members have a scannable view of touchpoints along the entire VFS product development lifecycle to help them identify areas to prioritize for investigation and iteration.

## Desired Business Outcomes

The service blueprint provides stakeholders with a high-level view of insights research to highlight key areas warranting attention.

## Undesired User and Business Outcomes

The service blueprint is not representative of the VFS teams’ experiences working on the platform.

## Assumptions

The service blueprint will enable VSP teams to identify pain points they see as important to investigate in order to improve the platform customer experience. 

## Solution Approach

The service blueprint connects VFS-VSP touchpoints to the platform processes that are required to deliver them. It will consist of:

- The customer journey map phase by phase
- The touchpoints for each VFS team member role
- The services provided by each VSP team
- The results from insights research across the platform.

The service blueprint is intended to *show us what to look at* - where in the customer journey the experience breaks down or opportunities exist. It will *not tell us what to do* - it is an investigative tool not a solutioning one. 

To validate our assumption, we will hold service blueprint workshops with each VSP team to understand each team’s interactions with VFS teams and identify pain points that should be prioritized for investigation.

## KPIs

## Solution Narrative

### Current Status

First, we built a high-level view showing the intersection of pain points and platform processes based on existing research insights. We created a [consolidated list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ufL_Ep6HE4nUm6E9zB8A0UMSc10gu91CsIJh56oi9h8/edit?usp=sharing) of pain points from:

- ROE documentation user research
- Testing discovery
- Post-onboarding surveys
- Questions on Slack channels 

We then individually rated each pain point as a:

1 - Blocker that stops people from working

2 - Frustrating but there are workarounds

3 - Annoyance

Then took the average score to show the acuteness of each pain point in the service blueprint.

Now, we are defining a global research plan to fill in gaps with robust data and establishing a process for updating and maintaining research findings for the map.  As well as planning the service blueprint workshops.

### Key Decisions

Type of tools to use - miro vs. mural, optimal workshop vs.  google sheet
