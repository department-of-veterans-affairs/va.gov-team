# How to use Perigean to recruit participants for your moderated user research studies

## Who is Perigean? 

Perigean is a small business that handles research recruiting for VA.gov teams. Our primary contacts are: 

- Brian Moon
- Shannon Housel

## Who are my VA.gov points of contact for Pergiean? 

- Lauren Alexanderson (lauren.alexanderson@va.gov; slack: @lalexanderson; github: lalexanderson-dsva) is your primary POC for all user research recruiting needs. 
- Mary O'Toole (mary.o'toole@va.gov; slack: @Mary O'Toole) is the COR for this contract. 
- Alicia Proctor (aproctor@governmentcio.com; slack: @Alicia Proctor) can take and process requests for research if Lauren is unavailable or unresponsive. 

## What do I need to know about using Perigean for my study?

- Perigean can recruit Veterans, caregivers, dependents, and service members for user research.
  - Of note, service members have proven to be a tricky population. Many service members work during normal business hours and cannot participate in studies Monday-Friday 9-5, or cannot install software for studies on their work machines. If you are looking to do a research study with service members, consider making yourself available to moderate during off hours. 
- Perigean **cannot** recruit current VA employees or VSOs for studies. If you are looking to do user research on internal systems, you will need to do the recruiting legwork yourself. 
- You may do remote (most popular) or in-person studies. However, Perigean can only recruit for in-person research to take place in the Washington DC metro area. 
  - If you are doing in-person research: You are responsible for coordinating a location where you can conduct your research. This may be a contractor's office, a WeWork space, a public library, a Veteran's home or office (if you don't mind doing the traveling). You may also use Perigean's space in Fredericksville. 
  - If you are looking to do in-person research outside of the DMV area, please reach out to Lauren. 

## How do I request recruiting from Perigean? 

- Here is a full research process. I recommend you reading the whole thing for standards. [June 2019 Research Process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/research-process.md). The [Research Practice Area folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research) also includes many helpful user research resources.
- Your official first step for any study (regardless of whether or not you are using Perigean) is to complete a research plan in GitHub. A [research plan template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/research-plan-template.md) can be found in the [Research Practice Area folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research). You must complete all questions in the template up to "resources". 
  - Research documentation should live with the product. Thus, your research plan should be saved in a research folder within your team's product folder. 
- Write a conversation guide for your moderated research. [Conversation guide template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md). 
- **Once you are ready, slack or email Lauren Alexanderson the link to your research plan and conversation guide.** 
  - Do not go directly to Perigean, even if you have worked with them in the past. 
- Remote research can be requested up to 1 week out from your desired start date (more advance notice is great); in-person research requires a minimum of 2 weeks advance notice. 
- Lauren will submit your research to Perigean,  send an email to kick off your study, and create a slack channel for you to communicate with Perigean during the study. 

## What else do I need to know?

- **Notes:** Perigean can take notes for your studies. Please indicate in your research plan if you need assistance with notes. This should be a fallback to having members of your own team take notes. 
  - You will need to provide your conversation guide when you request research in order to have notes. 
  - Perigean will post the notes in the research recruiting platform. **It is the lead researcher's responsibility** to collect the notes, conducting synthesis, and stripping out ALL personally identifiable information (PII) and personal health information (PHI) before posting to GitHub or sharing. 
- **Tools:** You have 3 options for technology for remote studies. Perigean holds the accounts for each of these. You will use Perigean's accounts, not your own; they will provide login details. 
  - Zoom: This is the most accessible tool for users of assistive devices. 
  - GoToMeeting: This tool is hard for participants to install, but works well for handing mouse control to a user for a prototype usabilty test. 
  - Webex: Teams building on VA.gov sometimes prefer Webex because it is an approved tool for their teams. 
  - Please indicate in your research plan which tool you would prefer to use. It is recommended that you set up a practice session, so you are already familiar logging into Perigean's tools, practicing handoffs, and practicing your conversation guide prior to your first session. 
- **Recordings:** You may record the audio and your screen for your sessions, however:
  - You **must ask the user's permission at the start of the session** and **you must let your participant know on the record that you have started the recording**. See [conversation guide template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md). 
  - Perigean will keep the recordings for up to 1 week following the study. It is your responsibility as lead researcher to download any recordings you need for synthesis and destroy the files when you are done. 
  - Do NOT post session recordings to GitHub or Slack. 
  - If you would like to keep a clip for communication purposes, it is YOUR responsibility as lead researcher to strip the video clip of PII or PHI. 
- **Surveys:** Seriously, just don't do surveys. They are not allowed under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). If you need help considering a different way to do user research, mention your questions at the weekly design meeting, or talk to Lauren. 
- **No-shows:** Life happens. Participants sometimes don't show up to sessions, or have emergencies. Be prepared to need to reschedule some of your sessions during your study. I recommend asking for more participants than you will need, and providing ample open slots for research, so that you can meet your targets within your timeframe.
