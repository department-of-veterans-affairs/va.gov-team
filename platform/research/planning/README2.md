# Generally speaking, PRA is hard.

# Overview of PRA at DSVA
[Start here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Request%20or%20Do%20Research/PRA%20and%20Recruiting/PRA/paperwork-reduction-act.md)

## What we don't have
As of February 2018, DSVA *does not* have a generic clearance. A generic clearance is one of two ways to obtain PRA clearance. It means you are approved to submit information collection (IC) through the fast-track PRA application process. Ok...plain language please? Fast-track is basically an expedited PRA application process that you can only submit requests to if you have a generic clearance. It's a 5-day approval process. If you don't hear back, you're approved! Crazy, right?

## What we do have
On February 15, 2018, DSVA successfully submitted and got approved a fast-track application under the Veteran Experience Office's generic clearance (OMB 2900-0770) for our screener questionnaire. 

### Update: On May 17, 2018 DSVA via the Veteran Experience Office received PRA approval through the fast-track process. This application was submitted through VEO's generic clearance 2900-0770.

**What does this mean?** We can streamline our user recruitment process by empowering users to tell us about themselves quickly and easily without talking to a human. This reduces the burden on our research team by reducing screener calls from 30-45 minutes to 5-15 minutes.

## What We're Working On
Since December 2017, Melissa was working on a generic clearance for DSVA in conjunction with a larger initiative with [Andrew Hughey](https://tools.usds.gov/team/andrew-hughey) (Login.gov @ USDS) to make PRA an easier process, for all agencies. 

**What does this mean?** Once submitted and approved, a process that has a 60-day and 30-day review complete with public commentary, we'll be able to manage, submit, and track our burden hours. This *should* open some doors for our research initiatives, designing with users.

## What to Do with This Screener
**(As of January 2019)** This screener is now available via [https://www.veteranusability.us](https://www.veteranusability.us). If you need to use a screener for a study and you are not using Perigean, contact Lauren.
