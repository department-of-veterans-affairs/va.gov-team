# Screener Questionnaire, under OMB 2900-0770
On May 17, 2018 DSVA via the Veteran Experience Office received PRA approval through the fast-track process. This application was submitted through VEO's generic clearance 2900-0770.

A working group of designers and researchers collaborated on the screener questionnaire to ensure we were asking questions that were meaningful, respectful and useful. Kudos to Alex Taylor, Lauren Alexanderson, and Kristin Walker for making this happen!
