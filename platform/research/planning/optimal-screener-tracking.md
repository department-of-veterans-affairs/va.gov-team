# Optimal Workshop Screener Tracking 

We have built the PRA Screener Questionnaire 2900-0770 as a template in Optimal Workshop. This template can be copied for specific groups or batches of recruiting, such as onsite research at a VAMC, recruiting collected by a team such as BAH, for specific comms outreach, or for specific audiences (VA-employed Veterans, caregivers, VSO Veterans). 

As of November 2018, uploading the data into Ripple is still a manual task. The purpose of this .md file is to track the screeners that exist and the status for updating them.
