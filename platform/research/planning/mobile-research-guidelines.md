This is the first draft of this document, which will evolve as we test out these guidelines during [Mobile Month, August 2020.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/platform/mobile-month)

# Mobile Research on VA.gov: Version 1

## Planning research

- Plan to have the participants complete the tasks using their own phone, as opposed to using an emulator on the desktop or shrinking the desktop browser down
- While we primarily encourage testing on mobile devices, testing on tablets is also acceptable
- Invision, UXPin, and staging are viable options for testing mobile flows on VA.gov
- To bring more context into the situation, consider starting the prototype from what looks like a phone’s home screen (IOS or Android)  rather than from your design’s start page already open. (Make sure the first hotspot on that screen targets the phone’s browser icon - Safari or Chrome.)
[Insert example screenshot]
- Do pilot tests with team members with at least an iPhone and an Android phone
- Prioritize a smaller amount of tasks (2-3) for the user test in case the initial phone and screen sharing setup takes longer than expected. Plan a few more tasks that are lower priority that you can get to if you have time.
  - Alternatively, build a buffer into how long you say the session will take in planning/recruiting docs. E.g. we think it'll be 45 min, so schedule 1 hour and set expectation w/ participants that it'll be 45-60 min
- Decide which method of mobile usability testing you'll use. Read more about that next.

### Selecting a method
There are two primary methods that are used for conducting mobile usability testing. Read about each one and their pros and cons.

#### Laptop hugging method

The “laptop hugging” method means that the user joins the call on their laptop and shows their mobile screen via the webcam. When the initial introduction to the session is done, the moderator asks the participant to turn their laptop 180 degrees so that the screen is looking away from the user. When the participant now places their hands around their computer and takes their mobile in their hands, it will be visible on the webcam.

Pros | Cons
--------- | ----------
Ability to see the full movement of the fingers | People without laptops or working web cam can’t use this method
Relatively easy instruction and setup | The quality of the webcam could be blurry

#### Screensharing method
The screensharing method requires the participant to download the Zoom app on their phone and share their screen as they complete the tasks of the usability study. 

Pros | Cons
--------- | ----------
People without laptops or webcams can use this method | Moderators can not see hand movements
x | Could be difficult for non-tech savvy people (there might have to be some reconfiguration in the settings section of the phone)
x | May be more difficult to use with assistive tech (we’ve heard about struggles to get mobile phone screen reader to come through the screensharing audio) 

## Recruiting

**For either method:**
- Ask Perigean to recruit people who visit VA.gov using a mobile device (specify if tablets are acceptable for your study)
- Ask Perigean to include in the screener: What kind of mobile (or tablet, if applicable) device do you use?

**If you're using the screen sharing method:**
- Ask Perigean to have the participants:
  - Download the Zoom mobile app prior to entering the session (provide links to Zoom app in app store if possible - placeholder for zoom links)
  - Enable settings on for screen sharing on their device
  
**If you're using the laptop-hugging method:**
- Ask Perigean to recruit people who are able to use a laptop, tablet with a stand, or a webcam 
- Make sure Perigean recruits people who are comfortable using their laptop/tablet camera or webcam
- Ask Perigean to have the participants:
  - Do a dry run of the laptop hugging method
  - Send an illustration, photo, or step-by-step instructions of how the laptop hugging works (placeholder for resources here)
  
  
## During sessions
  
**Screensharing method**

- Confirm with the participant in the beginning of the session that they are using a mobile device (or tablet if applicable), and be prepared to end the session if not
- Make sure they have the Zoom mobile app downloaded, and be prepared to send them a link to it via email if needed
- Note that a security warning about exposing sensitive information may pop up upon users sharing their screen via Zoom. Make sure the participant has the chance to read it and agree to it before proceeding. Reassure them that we will save recordings only for the purposes of capturing their experience accurately, and then dispose of them securely within a week.
- For troubleshooting screen sharing in iOS, [reference the Zoom documentation here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005890803-iOS-Screen-Sharing).
- For troubleshooting screen sharing on Android, [reference the Zoom documentation here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen).
- Don't forget to start the recording!
- Ask your participant to be mindful of thinking outloud since you will not be able to see a mouse cursor go through the prototype

**Laptop hugging method - step-by-step instructions**

- The facilitator and the participant join the Zoom call on desktop devices. 
- The facilitator asks the participant to turn on the webcam.
- The facilitator asks the participant to turn their laptop 180 degrees so that the screen is looking away from the participant. Tip: it is easier to explain the method when the facilitator shows it with their computer first.
- Once the participant has turned around their computer, the facilitator asks them to adjust the screen angle so that their mobile screen and hands are fully visible in the camera.
- Tip: Ask the participant to turn down the brightness on their phone as low as it will go. Otherwise, it looks like a flashlight — everything is washed out.
- The facilitator sends the prototype link to the participant in a way that they can open it on their mobile (e.g. email or SMS). With the live application, the participant is opening the app/webpage.
- The facilitator moderates the session as planned and observes the user behavior on the screen.
