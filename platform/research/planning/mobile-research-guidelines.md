This is the first draft of this document, which will evolve as we test out these guidelines during [Mobile Month, August 2020.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/platform/mobile-month)

# Mobile Research on VA.gov: Version 1

## Planning research

- Plan to have the participants complete the tasks using their own phone, as opposed to using an emulator on the desktop or shrinking the desktop browser down
- While we primarily encourage testing on mobile devices, testing on tablets is also acceptable
- Invision, UXPin, and staging are viable options for testing mobile flows on VA.gov
- To bring more context into the situation, consider starting the prototype from what looks like a phone’s home screen (IOS or Android)  rather than from your design’s start page already open. (Make sure the first hotspot on that screen targets the phone’s browser icon - Safari or Chrome.)
[Insert example screenshot]
- Do pilot tests with team members with at least an iPhone and an Android phone
- Prioritize a smaller amount of tasks (2-3) for the user test in case the initial phone and screen sharing setup takes longer than expected. Plan a few more tasks that are lower priority that you can get to if you have time.
  - Alternatively, build a buffer into how long you say the session will take in planning/recruiting docs. E.g. we think it'll be 45 min, so schedule 1 hour and set expectation w/ participants that it'll be 45-60 min
- Decide which method of mobile usability testing you'll use. Read more about that next.

### Selecting a method
There are two primary methods that are used for conducting mobile usability testing. Read about each one and their pros and cons.

#### Laptop hugging method

The “laptop hugging” method means that the user joins the call on their laptop and shows their mobile screen via the webcam. When the initial introduction to the session is done, the moderator asks the participant to turn their laptop 180 degrees so that the screen is looking away from the user. When the participant now places their hands around their computer and takes their mobile in their hands, it will be visible on the webcam.

#### Screensharing method
The screensharing method requires the participant to download the Zoom app on their phone and share their screen as they complete the tasks of the usability study. 

## Recruiting

**For either method:**
- Ask Perigean to recruit people who visit VA.gov using a mobile device (specify if tablets are acceptable for your study)
- Ask Perigean to include in the screener: What kind of mobile (or tablet, if applicable) device do you use?

**If you're using the screen sharing method:**
- Ask Perigean to have the participants:
  - Download the Zoom mobile app prior to entering the session (provide links to Zoom app in app store if possible - placeholder for zoom links)
  - Enable settings on for screen sharing on their device
  
**If you're using the laptop-hugging method:**
- Ask Perigean to recruit people who are able to use a laptop, tablet with a stand, or a webcam 
- Make sure Perigean recruits people who are comfortable using their laptop/tablet camera or webcam
- Ask Perigean to have the participants:
  - Do a dry run of the laptop hugging method
  - Send an illustration, photo, or step-by-step instructions of how the laptop hugging works (placeholder for resources here)
  
  
  ## During research
  
  Note that a security warning may pop up upon users sharing their screen. Make sure the participant.
