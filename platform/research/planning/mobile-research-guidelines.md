This is the first draft of this document, which will evolve as we test out these guidelines during [Mobile Month, August 2020.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/platform/mobile-month)

# Mobile Research on VA.gov: Version 1

## Planning research

- Plan to have the participants complete the tasks using their own phone, as opposed to using an emulator on the desktop or shrinking the desktop browser down
- While we primarily encourage testing on mobile devices, testing on tablets is also acceptable
- Invision, UXPin, and staging are viable options for testing mobile flows on VA.gov
- To bring more context into the situation, consider starting the prototype from what looks like a phone’s home screen (IOS or Android)  rather than from your design’s start page already open. (Make sure the first hotspot on that screen targets the phone’s browser icon - Safari or Chrome.)
[Insert example screenshot]
- Do pilot tests with team members with at least an iPhone and an Android phone
- Prioritize a smaller amount of tasks (2-3) for the user test in case the initial phone and screen sharing setup takes longer than expected. Plan a few more tasks that are lower priority that you can get to if you have time.
  - Alternatively, build a buffer into how long you say the session will take in planning/recruiting docs. E.g. we think it'll be 45 min, so schedule 1 hour and set expectation w/ participants that it'll be 45-60 min
- Decide which method of mobile usability testing you'll use. Read more about that next.

### Selecting a method
There are two primary methods that are used for conducting mobile usability testing. Read about each one and their pros and cons.

#### Laptop hugging method


#### Screensharing method
The screensharing method requires the participant to download the Zoom app on their phone and share their screen as they complete the tasks of the usability study.

  - Note the security warning users will see upon sharing screen
