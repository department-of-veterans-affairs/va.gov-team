# Planning in-person research

In-person research can provide valuable insights that remote research cannot. There are several ways to do in-person research as a researcher on a VSP product. 

Remember that you are representing the VA when you do in-person research. Our ability to continue to do research may be affected by you behavior in a research session. That means you must be on your best professional behavior; be courteous, and do not be a jerk. Maintain a neutral, empathetic demeanor - from your facial expressions to your tone of voice. Plan everything to the nth degree. Do not leave logistics to the last minute; this reflects poorly on the VA. 

## Leverage the Perigean contract 

You can work with Lauren to use the Pergiean contract for in-person research. However, there are a few limitations: 
1. The research must be physically performed in the DC/MD/VA metro area. This may be challenging for researchers who are based in other cities. 
2. We will reimburse participants not only for the time spent with you but also for travel. This means that it is extra costly to us if you cancel or are unprepared for your sessions. 
3. **At least 2 weeks notice** is required for initiating an in-person research study. Research plans and conversation guides must be submitted together to Lauren/DEPO at least 2 weeks prior to the desired start of the study. No exceptions. 
4. You will be responsible for your own recording and taking notes. If you wish to film or record a participant, you are responsible for securing and testing any equipment you will need. You will also need to print and have participants sign [this additional consent form](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/2024_VA-Consent-Form-Generic.docx). The same rules apply w/r/t what you do with the recordings (aka, DO NOT POST THEM ON YOU TUBE). 
5. As the researcher, **YOU are responsible for securing a location to perform the research**. You will need to provide this location, along with instructions for entry, as part of your research plan. See details on location options/recommendations below. 
6. Bring a buddy - for both research practice reasons and personal safety reasons, do not do in-person research alone. 

## Location options: 
  - **You may use the Perigean Offices in Fredricksburg, Virginia**. The Perigean team can work with you to set up a room in their offices, have participants travel there, and control the environment. Fredricksburg and the surrounding area has a strong Veteran community, and it is an easier location than DC (with less traffic!) 
  - **You may reserve a room at VA offices at 811 Vermont**. If you are not a VA employee, you will need to identify a VA employee as your buddy who can help you reserve the room and escort participants through security. 
  - You can reserve a conference room at a public library in the DMV area, or if you are a member of other work spaces, such as WeWork or Cove, you may use those as well. However, you will be responsible for escorting your participants through security, and if there is a cost to your reservation, you will not be reimbursed. 
  - You can use a conference room in your company's offices, if you would like. You would be responsible for arranging room reservations, meeting the participant, escorting the participant in and out, etc. 
  - If you would like to discuss other options, please contact Lauren. 

## Recommendations
- We recommend doing the research in a secure location. Although it may be useful to conduct contextual inquiry with a participant in their own environment (e.g. at home), we cannot guarantee your safety, nor can we reimburse your travel to/from participants' homes. 
- We recommend that you do not choose a business, such as a coffee shop, because participants may not want to discuss their private information in a public space. Additionally, you cannot control the environment. 
- Factor in extra details when you're selecting a location: 
  -  How easy/difficult is it to get there? 
  -  What transportation and parking options are available nearby? 
  -  Will your participant need to go through security? 
  -  What do they need to bring with them to get through security? 
  -  Who will escort your participant through security, if needed? (This is where having a buddy comes in). 
  -  Do you have a room where you can consistently conduct sessions? Is it private/able to be private? 
  -  Does the location have public wifi, or a guest network? 
  -  Are you having the participant bring their computer/phone/tablet, or will you provide one? 
  -  How will you set up the space? 
  
  
 ## Work with a VSO
  
Some VSOs, like Blinded Veterans for America or Disabled Veterans of America, have been particularly helpful in the past to allow us to conduct guerilla research at their conferences or events. Talk to DEPO staff about this option. You'll need to plan far in advance. We do not have a good way to provide a thank-you gift to participants outside of the Perigean contract, so this format of research would have that caveat. 

## Work with a VAMC 

We have, in past, visited VA Medical Centers and conducted research with participants in the waiting area. You will need to work with DEPO teams, as well as the VAMC staff, to arrange this well in advance. Do not just show up at a VAMC and expect to be able to do research. We do not have a good way to provide a thank-you gift to participants outside of the Perigean contract, so this format of research would have that caveat. 

We are always happy to discuss other options that may pertain to your specific research challenge. Just be mindful that we need to be sensitive about how and when we do research.
