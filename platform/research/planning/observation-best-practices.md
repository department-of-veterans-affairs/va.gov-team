# Observation Best Practices

## Who should observe?

In general, your whole team should be invited as observers to sessions. This increases empathy and enables a shared understanding of your users' experience with your product.

In most cases, we also recommend inviting your relevant VA stakeholders to observe sessions. This does not apply to studies targeted toward folks with disabilities, more detail provided below.

## How to invite observers?

### People specified in Research Plan: 

By default, the people that you have specified in your research plan will receive meeting invitations to all scheduled research sessions and will be added to a dedicated Slack channel for the duration of your research study. For this reason, you may consider keeping this list to just your core product team, your practice lead, etc., inviting VA stakeholders separately (see below).

### VA stakeholders:

VA stakeholders and team members with va.gov email addresses who receive Google calendar meeting invitations, will not reliably receive any updates or cancellations to meetings. One way to prevent scheduling issues is to create a signup sheet [(see example signup sheet)](https://adhocteam-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/leyda_hughes_adhocteam_onmicrosoft_com/Eaq_oEAlyOVGt-oYrxRd_UYBruMEo4cVtKC1wRqrVTChCA?e=dHaQBc) with embedded Zoom meeting links that can be kept up to date. This has the added benefit of letting you control the number of participants that can join any given session. Note: VA stakeholders may not be able to access Google Suite apps so Sheets may not be the best choice.

We recommend the following process when inviting observers:

1. Decide who specifically you would like to invite, being mindful to not overwhelm the participants with a crowd and consider the subject matter in determining if you should establish a maximum number of observers.
2. Send an email inviting them to observe (see example emails below). Make it clear that they should NOT forward the invitation. In the email:
   - Briefly explain the goals of the research
   - Remind them that there is no obligation and that there will be more opportunities to observe in the future
   - Provide time slots for signup
   - Set a deadline for signup (if this is important to your planning)
3. After the observer list is confirmed - Slack your Perigean team with the list and ask if they can be added to the calendar invite (if you’re not using a signup sheet)
4. Email your observers with confirmation of their signup time and the list of observer instructions. 
   - Include the Zoom links specific for each time slot in case there are any problems accessing the calendar invite. (Remind them again not to forward the email.)

## People with disabilities or who have experienced trauma

### People who have experienced trauma

You may not know if a participant has experienced trauma, but we know that many Veterans _have_ experienced trauma and this may impact their willingness to be recorded or observed, even after they have consented.  Be prepared to incorporate [trauma informed best practices - future link to markdown file]() in your session. Be flexible and help your participant feel safe, in control, and give them choices when being observed in research sessions. Stay calm and understanding. 

If you know a participant has experienced trauma ahead of time, we recommend reaching out to a health care expert or an accessibility specialist to help you plan your study.

- Safety: 
   - Explain who you, who the observers are, what you’re doing and why
- Control:
   - Allow participants to opt out of being observed, understanding that this may mean taking notes from the recording.
   - If your participant has opted out of being observed and does not consent to being recorded ask if they would be comfortable if your notetaker remains in the session as this will be the only record of the session.
- Choice:
   - Let participants know that they can choose to stay off camera if they prefer

### People who use assistive technology (AT)

For people with disabilities, especially those with acquired disabilities, it may be uncomfortable to discuss the nature of their disability in a group setting. Whenever possible, aim for the least number of participants as possible.

We recommend limiting to 3 people, when possible, with a maximum of 5:

- 1 facilitator 
- 1 notetaker 
- 1 accessibility specialist (in the case of AT studies)

  – – –

- 1 observer (2 max, if necessary)
	
#### Researcher To-dos:

1. In your research plan ‘must have’ requirements, specify that participants will need to be informed about the observers and that they must express consent to being observed as part of the participation agreement (this is not standard practice on non-assistive tech studies).
2. At the start of each session, you must again ask for participant’s permission, if it is OK with them for observers to be part of the session, vs. just informing them that your teammates are taking notes and observing.

## Observer Instruction Examples

### Example A: Instructions to send to observers specified in Research Plan

#### Sample instructions to send to internal observers:

- Please join a few minutes early. If you arrive late, I may not see your request to be admitted from the waiting room.
- Please keep your video and sound off in the Zoom session, and change your name to “Observer”. 
- If you have a Zoom profile photo, please remove it for the session.
- You can communicate with me in a new thread I will create in DSVA #feedback-backchannel. Here I will look for questions that you want to ask the participant, and also possibly for technical help if I get stuck during the session. I won’t be reading the channel during the entire session because I’ll be focusing on the participant, but you can use it to communicate with the other observers and share your thoughts. This is also where I’ll communicate if the participant is early, late, or a no-show.
- Jot down your observations/takeaways from the session, which you can share directly with the facilitator and/or in the optional team debrief meeting later in the day.

### Example B: Email Invitation to VA stakeholders

#### Sample email to send to stakeholder observers:
 
**Hi Everyone,**
 
**We're kicking off Vet Center usability research again. As with our previous Vet Center studies, we would like to invite you to observe with us. We have limited spaces so that we don’t overwhelm our veterans so we have included observing details and a sign-up link below.**
 
– – –
 
**STUDY DETAILS:**
 
As part of our broader Vet Center discovery work, we will be conducting a round of usability research sessions starting next week with Veterans. 
 
 - **Dates:** The study will run from Monday, Feb 1 and through Friday, 5th.
 
 - **Goal:** The goal is to assess design changes and improvements on an updated prototype to understand if Veterans have enough information to choose care at a Vet Center. These learnings will help us to refine the design for the pilot site MVP. 
 
**We’d like to invite you to observe these sessions!**
 
**Pilot session:** Prior to beginning Veteran sessions, we conduct a dry run where we run through and act out the entire study script with internal team members. This allows us to plan session timing and work out kinks before meeting with Veterans. You are welcome to attend the pilot session which will be held Friday, January 29 at 2p eastern. This is optional, of course, but may be helpful to attend for the first few minutes for anyone who hasn't yet attended a research session to see what a session would be like and where you can practice the instructions below.

**Veteran Sessions:** For anyone interested in observing, we have created a sign-up sheet with 2 slots for each available session. This is to help control the number of observers per session which can feel overwhelming to Veterans so we try to cap at 6 which will include a note taker and a few members of the product team. Zoom links for each session will be added and linked from this sign-up sheet as soon as they are scheduled. This spreadsheet will be kept up-to-date for the life of the study.

**Sign up spreadsheet:** If you'd like to observe, add your name to an available slot on this [sign up sheet.](https://adhocteam-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/leyda_hughes_adhocteam_onmicrosoft_com/Eaq_oEAlyOVGt-oYrxRd_UYBruMEo4cVtKC1wRqrVTChCA?e=dHaQBc)
   
 
**Observer instructions:**
 
 - Sessions are conducted via Zoom (unique zoom links can be found in each session column in the spreadsheet) 
 - The sessions should last about 45 minutes. [Note to researcher: this may vary depending on the study]
 - Plan to join 5 minutes [Note to researcher: adjust as needed] before start time to allow for changing your zoom settings. 
 - **You will be a silent observer** (please remember to mute yourself and turn off your video camera when you join the zoom meeting) 
 - **Change your name to “Observer”** instead of your name. 
 - If you have a **Zoom profile photo, please remove it** for the session.
 - If you have questions/comments for the researcher during the sessions, you can (privately) message in the zoom chat window, however, please note that it can be highly distracting to field messages while moderating. 
 - Be aware that it is common for research sessions to end if participants are ‘no shows’ after a few minutes of waiting time. We have scheduled 16 sessions with the goal of completing between 7-9. 
 - Sessions should include no more than 6 team members at a time. [Note to researcher: adjust as needed]
 - Please do not share the session signup sheet with anyone. Instead, please let me know if there is anyone else that I should invite and I would be happy to do so.
 - Session times are listed in **Eastern time.**  
 
Please let me know if you have any questions and thank you for participating in our research sessions! 
 
Thank you,
