## Research Goals
*Provide context for this research by explaining how it fits into the Veteran’s journey.*  
[See the Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)  

**Guiding Questions:**  
- What are the key moments this tool supports in the Veteran’s journey?  
- What outcomes are we aiming to achieve for Veterans and stakeholders?  

[Example Research Goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#research-goals)

> - "Participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form."  
> 
> **After completing your detailed findings below, you'll add metadata labels using the [Key Findings Metadata Labels Prompt](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/copilot-prompts/research-report/add-metadata-labels-to-findings-prompt.md).**
