4. Problem: place to submit a form - 
   1. “**Better navigation tools and options**. I find what I am looking for eventually, but it does take persistence. My fear is other vets who are not as persistent or tech and health savvy may not be well served by this VA portal.” Sat: 37, 03/28/18 
   2. “**Maybe just better access to submitted claims documents**. I could never view my docs submitted and was unsure if they were in the proper area. Other than that, the site is very helpful and informative. Nice job with all the upgrades! Thank you for your support to our Veterans.” Sat: 18, 11/20/2017

   3. I don't come to this site often When I do I always have login issues due to the fact I don't have a need to use this site on a regular bases Lt me decide when to change my password I don't like it when a site tells me what I can and can't use as a password and when to change my password. I won't remember the password I just changed because of your criteria. It's my password.” Sat: 63, 03/14/18
