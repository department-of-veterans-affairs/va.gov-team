### Project-specific setup

- [ ] Start from https://www.va.gov/ - in an incognito window so that links don't have "visited" treatment

## Intro - 3 minutes (:03)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. We work with the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs on a website called Vets.gov, and we're excited to talk with you today to get your feedback on the website

Before we start, a few things to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 50 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally move us along to the next topic.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start recording.*

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the application to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. **Think aloud!**
