## Research preparedness

On 11.23.20, Emily M., Emily W., Shawna, and Samara met to discuss concerns around VSA/VSP preparedness around research. Primarily, we agreed that there is room for improvement in how we are making sure members of both VSA and VSP are ready to conduct high quality research.

## Goals

- To come up with documentation that can help us do the following:
  - Evaluate designers' research abilities on the contract
  - Based on capabilities, make sure there are clear guidelines on what we think people need to do to be ready to independently run research

## Problems to solve/Questions

**Evaluation**

- How do we evaluate contractors' research abilities when they join the team?
- What does it means to be ready to independently conduct research?

**Training**

- How do we ensure people are prepared to run research (eg. observe sessions, training, etc)?

**Team roles**

- How do we ensure each team has the research capabilities they need (eg. do some people do more research than others?)?
- Should some people more dedicated researchers and some people be more dedicated designers?

**General**

- How do we implement evaluation/guidelines without being too heavy-handed or creating unnecessary process/bureaucracy?
