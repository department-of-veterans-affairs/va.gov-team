### [OCTO-DE Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md) 

<details><summary>Which OCTO priorities does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed. </summary>


`Objective 1:  VA‚Äôs digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.`  

> - **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.
> - **Key Result 2:** We have reduced the total time Veterans spend waiting for a response from our digital experiences by 50%, towards a goal of less than 4 seconds per transaction.
> - **Key Result 3:** 100% of transactions received via our digital experiences are either processed correctly or we have notified the user of an error.

`Objective 2: OCTO‚Äôs platforms are the fastest, most efficient, and most secure way to deliver products at VA.`

> - **Key Result 1:** 100% of authentications to our systems and tools (both Veteran-facing and internal) occur using a secure credential.
> - **Key Result 2:** We have reduced the total error rates in our platforms by 50% compared to Q4 2024, towards a goal less than 1% per endpoint.
> - **Key Result 3:** 100% of VA employees have access to a valuable Generative AI tool to help with their work.
> - **Key Result 4:** Each of our platforms* and tools increase the number of non-OCTO built capabilities or non-OCTO users by 50%. (*excluding mobile)

`Objective 3: OCTO teammates are empowered with the knowledge and resources they need to make sustained impact.`

> - **Key Result 1:** Team members reporting more than a reasonable amount of stress is 5 points lower for each quarter in 2025 than it was in the corresponding quarter in 2024.
> - **Key Result 2:** Every OCTO Portfolio identifies 2 or more strategic decisions per quarter that would benefit the larger OCTO team, and documents them publicly in a shared location.
> - **Key Result 3:** 75% or more team members are confident they have the knowledge needed to make effective decisions.

`Objective 4: OCTO positively influences VA's ability to deliver software products and services faster, safer, and with higher quality.`

> - **Key Result 1:** OCTO has delivered at least 10 impactful artifacts or learning activities (e.g., trainings, guides, COP meetings) focused on improving delivery practices that achieve an NPS score of 30 or higher from the target OIT delivery staff.
> - **Key Result 2:** OCTO has helped resolve/support at least 10 significant engineering issues or products outside our portfolio.

## Recruitment üéØ	
*OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.*

> [!NOTE]
> Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources: 
> - [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
> - [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
*Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?* 

> [!NOTE] 
> - Perigean **CANNOT** recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
> - Perigean can also support remote, [unmoderated studies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/perigean-recruiting-process-for-unmoderated-studie), however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. 
> - Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria

> [!NOTE]
> - **Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants.**
> - Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> [!TIP]
> - The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria.
> - Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria.
> - Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Review an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/pre-mhv-prototype/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md)

**List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study:**

## Timeline üóìÔ∏è
> [!NOTE]
> **Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.** 

### Prepare
*When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).*

**A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.** 
> [!NOTE]
> **Send pilot participant email in study Slack channel**

- `Pilot participant name:` **[Enter name]**
- `Date and time of pilot session:` **[Enter time]** 

### Research sessions
- `Planned dates of research:` **[Enter dates MM/DD-MM/DD]**

### Length of sessions
- `Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)` **[Enter time length]**
  
- `Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time)` **[Enter buffer time]**
  
- `Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)` **[Enter NUM per day]**

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. 

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. 

> [!TIP]
> Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. **(e.g. 3/17, Monday 9:00AM-1:00PM, 3:00PM-6:00PM EST; 3/18, Tuesday 9:00AM-6:00PM EST, etc.;** ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
