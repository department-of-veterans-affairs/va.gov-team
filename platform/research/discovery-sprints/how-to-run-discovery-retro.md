# Discovery Retrospective

The purpose of having a discovery retro is to reflect on how the team worked and discuss what worked and didn't work in order to improve the discovery process for the future. The discovery retro does not have to happen before or after putting together a presentation of the actual sprint and findings.

## Create goal(s) for retrospective

Share the goals with your team prior to the retrospective and write it out on the wall or open it on join.me so that everybody can visually see what they need to focus on

<a id="roles"></a>
## Establish roles
1. Facilitator: Somebody from discovery team or a neutral person
2. Notetaker: Somebody who will take notes, add to github and help facilitator keep track of time

_It is suggested that team leads do not lead retros so that they can take the time to reflect and participate in the conversation_

<a id="agenda"></a>
## Create an agenda

Create a list of things to go over in the meeting to help everybody can stick to the schedule and keep track of time

1. Quick overview: Review the goal of the retro and what the team will do at this meeting (3-5 mins)
2. Gather data: Sticky notes exercise for a) things that went well, and b) things that didn't go well (10 mins)
3. Generate insights: Group sticky notes into categories, what action items to we want to make to address them. Discuss what was successful and identify any roadblocks to success (15 mins)
4. Prioritize: Take the top insights and discuss how they ought to be prioritized and create next steps (10 mins)
5. Last call: Discuss how the retro went and how it can be improved in the future (10 mins)

## Gathering data activities

There are many ways to do retros so teams should find a method that most fits their project. Here are 3 examples to start with but teams are encouraged to edit this document and add other suggestions. 

### 1. Pre-retro homework :) :| :( 
Have team list out what worked, didn't work items in a table or list a day or two advance. Allowing everybody to up vote each other's comment helps save time for deeper discussions at the actual meeting. Recommended for remote teammates. 

Think about and write answers to the following questions. Put them into a template document to be shared ahead of time. If someone else has already added something you'd like to say, you may add a "+1" instead of duplicating. The stars represent the most popular topics that the team wanted to discuss in depth. 

- **:)** What worked well?
- **:/** What was just meh?
- **:(** What didn't work well?

Example from Vets.gov design retro:

| :) | :/ | :( |
|---|---|---|
| Feels like the design team is continuing to "gel" | | Losing some teammates +1 |
| New core team is getting good improvements out soon! | Not much momentum on projects +2 | Lack of clarity in how to move forward because the roadmap is unknown +4 ★ |
| Good rapport with VA team makes hiccups less stressful #ridethewave ★ | Many moving parts within a project can make it harder to make confident decisions | Clarity on what kinds of things are an enhancement to the experience, vs CHANGES that need stakeholder approval +1 |
| Forward looking collaborative work helped instigate some technical advances ★ | More instances making it harder to be nimble in how we solve problems |  |
| Inspired a little more comprehensive approach to forms | When is it okay to test good ideas in the wild vs exhaustively prove it out before moving at all? +1 ★ |  |
| Excited about creation of core & discovery teams to provide foundational team-wide support | Feel like an island in a sea of engineers ★ | Unknowns with new administration |
| "Drawing a line in the sand" with IA work | | Marvel not working on the VA network |
| Having core team work on sketch templates and more consistencies across Vets.gov | No design cadence ★ | |

### 2. In-person sticky notes activity 
Sticky notes exercise for a) things that went well, and b) things that didn't go well. Create a shared picture of what happened during the retrospective. Participants must be on-site for this activity.

### 3. Use Retrium

[Retrium](https://www.retrium.com/) is a tool designed to help remote teams run retrospectives. The tool includes a timer and an option for all members to write on stickies and up vote each others' thoughts.

## Next step action items
Taking the top insights and other findings, put together a checklist of to-dos and designate a person for each action item
