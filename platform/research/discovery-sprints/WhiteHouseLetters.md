In the previous administration, we worked with the White House Office of Correspondance to get batches of letters that were written to the President around a certain topic.

For example, if we were doing a project on a specific form, we could ask their office if anyone has written to the President about that form.  Or, if we wanted more information on the Choice Act, and how Veterans view the program, we could reach out and get a set of letters about that.  

By providing them the following information, they usually got back to us within a week. 

- Any keywords to help them look 
- Location of letters you are looking for
- How many letters?
- What type of person? (Female, elder, Veteran, care provider, etc.) 

We are working to lock down contact information for the next administration and will update this page as soon as possible.
