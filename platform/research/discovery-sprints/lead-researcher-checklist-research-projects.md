# Research/Designer End-to-End Checklist: Research Projects

## Pre-Research Checklist
- [ ] Complete [research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/research_plan_template.md)
- [ ] Get a content review of anything you are putting in front of users
- [ ] Have ready the item that you are testing (high or low-fidelity prototypes, web pages, card sort, tree test, etc.) 
- [ ] Identify a fellow designer or researcher to moderate if you are not running your own research. Discuss your research plan with them.  
- [ ] Create a conversation/discussion guide ([template here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Request%20or%20Do%20Research/Planning%20and%20Process%20Management/Conversation-guide-template.md)) to drive the research session. Review with your team. Add a link to your research plan and planning issues.
- [ ] At least 2 weeks out: Review your recruiting plan with UX Lead + Research Advisor and your PM. Goals of meeting include:
    - Recruiting Criteria
    - Recruiting Strategy (Guerilla? Perigean? Ripple? Internal VA team? VSO?) 
    - Technology Needed (Optimal? Join.me? GTM? Video? Audio record?) 
    - Who will be responsible for logistics? (Scheduling times with participants, setting up rooms, dealing with consent forms)
  - Know that recruiting is harder and can take longer if your request is very specific. Weigh your timeline with your level of specificity. Ask yourself if very specific participants are needed to get the answers you need! 
  - If you are working with Perigean, internal VA UAT group, or another recruiting group: Make sure you give 2 weeks notice, and have ready a calendar of times you are available to do research. (Template to come). You and that team will be responsible for scheduling your sessions. 
- [ ] Determine how / if you are recording the session. (If in person, will you videotape? Audio record? GoToMeeting record?) 

## Before Sessions
- [ ] At least 2 weeks out: work with your PM to create [planning issues](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Request%20or%20Do%20Research/archive/Longform%20Planning%20Issue%20Template.md) in [Vets.gov team repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team) for recruitment, research, and synthesis. These should be  tagged with "research" and the relevant team's tag, as well as the researcher, and other relevant parties (e.g. UX lead) *Include the link to your [research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/research_plan_template.md).* 
- [ ] As sessions are scheduled: 
    - Book GoToMeeting or Join.me channel (if using) on the [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=p7hvahcpk5f1p5e4mdeoodfs04%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York) 
    - Set up [GoToMeeting](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/go-to-meeting-instructions.md) Room
    - *(If you are using Perigiean October-November 2018, they will book GTM & Google for you. YOU are responsible for making sure it is done, though!)* 
    - Send out calendar invite to your team. 
     - [ ] **Always invite: Team Lead, PM, Your content person, FE/BE engineers, UX Lead (Lauren)**
     - [ ] **Consider inviting: other designers, Rachael Roueche, Josh Vargas (QA)**
    - [ ] Book space (Team Offices 3 or 5 at 811 Vermont) to conduct your sessions or make other arrangements. 
    - [ ] If you are not using Perigean, ensure consent forms are signed. (We prefer to use [Hello Sign](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Request%20or%20Do%20Research/Scheduling%20and%20Running%20Sessions/consentform-hello-sign-instructions.md) for remote sessions!) 
- [ ] 4 days out: Review assets (mockups, prototypes, staged pages) with Vets.gov UX Lead in 1/2 or full team design meetings or 1:1 if needed
- [ ] 3 days out: Check in with UX Lead/Researcher/Recruiter on recruiting/logistics progress
- [ ] 3 days out: Finalize assets, ensure all research leads have access
- [ ] 2-3 days out: Appoint and confirm note takers (SHOULD include members of your team, CAN be other designers, etc.)
- [ ] Do a practice run/pilot session with UX Lead or another designer (e.g. test your conversation/discussion guide, test your card sort, etc.) at least 1-2 full biz days before the first session or release of the research. 
- [ ] 1 day out: Check in with note taker(s) to ensure they're prepared
- [ ] 1 day out: Check that you have login info and an up-to-date app for virtual meeting, if using
- [ ] 1 day out: Check in with research team on final recruiting/logstics details

## During Remote Usability Sessions
- [ ] make sure you've opened the virtual meeting in the app rather than the web interface
- [ ] make sure you mute all notifications, or better yet, turn unnecessary applications off!
- [ ] make sure the entry/exit ding sound is turned off in virtual meeting
- [ ] make sure all attendees (except participant) are muted
- [ ] have open a neutral/blank screen for introduction 
- [ ] have your conversation guide somewhere accessible that the participant cannot see
- [ ] check #feedback-backchannel for questions and notes

## After Sessions
- [ ] Encourage notetakers and observers to share top 3-5 takeaways at the end of each session. Quickly transcribe to post-its/Reframer/Handrail/other synthesis system and cluster to ID early patterns 
- [ ] Review your conversation guide and make updates based on input from users and observers, if needed
- [ ] Work with notetaker to ensure additions of notes to GitHub product folder, and Reframer (if using) daily, cull and tag (DAILY)
- [ ] Once you have transcriptions, decide how you want to store recordings of sessions (as full sessions on your laptop? key snippets uploaded to GH?) and make sure that happens
- [ ] Depending on your process, transcribe to postits – cluster – ID opportunity areas and pain points, cluster daily to ID probe areas for ensuing sessions (DAILY/BIWEEKLY) work collaboratively with design if possible
- [ ] Conduct [synthesis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Request%20or%20Do%20Research/Synthesis)
- [ ] Work with your team lead and PM to submit issues in Github
- [ ] Submit any necessary helpdesk tickets
- [ ] Update the [research history](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Research%20History.md)!

## Readouts
- [ ] Iteratively build your readout deck so it’s not a mad dash at the end 
- [ ] Share deck readout draft with Lauren/fellow designers for feedback (optional)
- [ ] Do a readout with:
  - Stakeholders 
  - 1/2 or full team design meetings
  - Your team meetings
  - Demo day 
- [ ] Debrief with team on process and results
- [ ] Reflect on about ways to improve/better qs to ask/other people to involve (WEEKLY) drawing parallel to design critique
