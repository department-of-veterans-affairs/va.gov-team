# Stakeholders 

[Here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Discovery/Archive/Master%20Stakeholder%20Deck%20Template.pptx) is the master stakeholder deck, which can be customized as needed. 
### Working with Stakeholders 

It's important to build trust and relationships with all stakeholders involved in a product.  When working with stakeholders, make sure to: 

- Ask around and see if anyone on our team has worked with the stakeholder before
- Remember to never start work without strong stakeholders
- Try to meet them in person or in a 1:1 setting
- Set tone for future work 
- Set goals and reiterate them often 
- Allow for time to get buy-in
- Identify what they think is true
- Identify if they are assuming certain outcomes 
- Learn what their general attitude are towards the project
- See how they describe the goal 
- Learn this person's incentives to see if theya re aligned with the project's success
- Gain background on the type of influence they have
- Ask who else do they communicate with on a regular basis
- Figure out stakeholder's role and how they need to participate throughout the project
- Remember the more you can include stakeholders in the process the easier it is to get and maintain buy-in

### Stakeholder interview sample questions
Here are some suggested stakeholder interview questions and ways to kick off the conversation! 

We're starting to do some discovery/investigation related to [project] and we want to get your input. Please feel free to be totally frank. Honest answers are essential to this process. We're talking to people throughout the organization, and will group answers together rather than focusing on what one person said. 

- How long have you been in this role?
- What are your essential duties and responsibilities?
- What does a typical day look like?
- Who are the people and teams you work most closely with? How well is this relationship working?
- Regarding the project we're working on, how would you define success? From your perspective, what will have changed for the better once it's complete?
- Do you have any concerns about this project?
- What do you think the greatest challenges to success are? Internal and external?

### These questions are more for stakeholders who work with the backend process (not to be confused with application backend)
- What are your most common tasks with the system?
- What problems have you noticed?
- What kinds of work-arounds do you use?
- Have you any concerns about this project?
- Is there anyone else we should talk to?

### Plan meetings in advance
Sometimes it is difficult to schedule time to check in and chat with stakeholders
- Highly recommend to see stakeholders in person. Many of our VA stakeholders are not local and we can gain a lot of credibility to make the effort to meet with them in person. Check in with them to see the next time they will be in the DMV area or find a way to go visit them.
- Send stakeholder calendar invites ahead of time. Planning meetings can slow down a sprint depending on how busy our stakeholders are. 
Schedule on calendar days for: 
   - kickoff 
   - check-ins
   - end of discovery read out
- Engage with them outside of work hours. Take stakeholders out for happy hour, dinner or any of [our awesome tours](https://github.com/usds/tours).
