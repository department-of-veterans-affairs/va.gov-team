# Previous Readme Content From Deprecated 'Work Practices' Folder

## What is this? 
The content in this folder was made with love by multiple generations of our designers and researchers.

Current maintainer of this directory: Lauren Alexanderson 

This folder includes research resources, processes & guidance, and information about the research practice. It does NOT include design components or research components for specific products. You should find those in the appropriate product folder.

## Getting Started
Welcome to the team! If all has gone well, you've made it through our [main onboarding section](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/wiki/VA.gov-Onboarding) and you're ready to start working in your practice area. This should help you get started. 

## Practice area onboarding
You've already gone through the overall onboarding, but here you'll find information specific to research. Note that research falls under the [design practice](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/master/Practice%20Areas/Design), so most of the information will be found there. 

### Onboarding: If you're new or need a refresher
- [How we UX](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Vets.gov_HowWeUX_Jan2018.pdf)

### Research Team Treehouse
*This is an internal organizing tool for research and ux leads and anyone supporting admin on research.*

### Projects
*Some product research docs are cross-posted here. The new model is for these to live in product folders We are working on making sure that the research elements live in appropriate product folders.*

## [Tools We Use](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Design/Design%20Resources/designtools.md)
### Communication
- **Slack**: All conversations about products should take place in the appropriate DSVA product channel, not a private DM, an AdHoc only, or DSVA only channel. 
  - Bring any design questions for your fellow designers to the **#design** channel. 
  - Bring any research questions to the **#vetsdotgov-research** channel. 
- **GitHub**: Both for code and for storing #allthethingz. This is our knowledge management system too, so document everything!   
  - Your research process should be documented end-to-end in a [research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/research_plan_template.md) stored in your product folder. When you're done with research, add your study & the link to your research folder to the [Research History](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Research%20History.md)   - Your [design decisions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/master/Practice%20Areas/Design) should also be documented in your product folder; upload and store design files, link to prototypes and templates.  
- **Join.me**: We conduct our meetings on join.me/vetsdotgov-design. If you need to use the design channel at times when we don't have meetings check with UX Lead. You can also use join.me to conduct some types of research sessions, if you don't need the user to interact with a prototype. 

### User Research
## User Research and Usability Testing
- **Ripple**: Ripple is our Veteran database for research. We also have other options to recruit Veterans. Check in with UX/Research lead for support. 
- **GoToMeeting**: This is the tool we use to conduct remote research sessions. Requires you to have the desktop version to use. Review the [GoToMeeting Instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Request%20or%20Do%20Research/Scheduling%20and%20Running%20Sessions/GoTo%20Meeting%20Instructions.md) before you use it. Check in with UX/Research Lead if you need support.
- **Zoom**: This is the tool we use to conduct remote research sessions with users who rely on assistive devices like screenreaders. Review [Zoom Instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Request%20or%20Do%20Research/Scheduling%20and%20Running%20Sessions/Zoom%20Instructions.md) before you use it. Also check out the [Zoom Assistive Tech Checklist and Troubleshooting doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Request%20or%20Do%20Research/Scheduling%20and%20Running%20Sessions/zoom-screenreader-session-checklist.md) for tips about using Zoom with participants who rely on screen readers.
- **Optimal Workshop**: This is a research tool you can use to conduct card sorts, tree tests, or unmoderated prototype tests. You can also use the Reframer tool within Optimal Workshop to synthesize research. 
  - Alex Taylor is account owner
- **Handrail**: This tool facilitates notetaking during research sessions and synthesis.
- **Mural**: This is a great group brainstorming tool. Can be used to conduct remote post-it synthesis, etc. 
- **Trello**: Trello is a free tool that can also be used to [conduct remote synthesis with your team](https://builttoadapt.io/using-trello-for-user-research-synthesis-fb1abdfc7c4b). 

## Practice Area Schedule
There is not a separate research meeting, outside of research readouts for specific products & PI research readouts. The schedule for the former are determined by the product team and their stakeholders; the schedule for the latter is set by Research Lead. Designers discuss their research plans, issues, lessons learned, and readouts in the design meetings. [Design meeting schedule](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Design/meetings/Meetings.md)
