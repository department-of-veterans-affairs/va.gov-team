As researchers, our number one priority is to keep our participants safe. When working with Veterans, it is particularly important to be aware of our participants' psychological and physical well-being during our research sessions. If you find yourself in a session with a Veteran who is experiencing a medical or psychological emergency, follow the protocol below to request assistance. 

### Requesting emergency assistance
1. Stop your research activity in order to attend to the participant. 
2. Contact the recruiting team (Perigean) over Slack immediately. Please use the direct message set up by Lauren at the start of the study so that everyone is notified. 
3. Include a detailed description of the scenario so that the recruiting team can respond appropriately (for example: the participant stopped responding and became listless during the interview; the participant vocalized intent to harm themselves/others). Be available to answer questions, so that Perigean can reach out to 911 or the Veteran Crisis Line as apppropriate. 
4. Follow Perigean's guidance carefully. A member of the recruiting team may join the meeting (if they are not already online to take notes) to identify appropriate next steps. They may escalate to the Veteran Crisis Line or to 911 as needed. They may give you specific instructions about how to keep the participant engaged or how to hand off controls of the session so that they can stay with the participant until emergency support is available. 
5. After the emergency has been handled, please update the Slack channel with any relevant details.
6. As needed, loop in your government project point of contact (usually your OCTO lead).  

Witnessing an emergency can be a traumatizing experience. Be sure to take time to pause and assess your own energy, emotional comfort, and capacity, and let your team know if you need any support. Consider a debrief with your team and/or the observers on the call as on opportunity to acknowledge this experience and consider how we can better support researchers and participants moving forward. 

### Creating a safe space for participants
Although we may not intend it, research sessions inherently create a power dynamic where the moderator is in control: participants don't know what questions they will be asked, what tasks they will be given, and the moderator represents the VA. Before you start your research study, consider ways that you can create a psychologically safe space for participants that shifts the power dynamic in favor of the participant. 

**Get an accessibility review.** Our VSP Accessibility team (@vagov-accessibility on Slack) can provide expert advice on effective and ethical research design for participants with various disabilities. Ensure your research methods and conversation guide are appropriate for our particpant population. Be prepared to be creative to accommodate disabilities. 

**Be mindful of participant's behavior.** If they appear to be distressed, take a moment to check in with them. Allow them to bypass questions if they need to. Help them feel comfortable to take breaks if they need to. 

**Prioritize the participant over the research.** Be prepared to pivot from your conversation guide and approach in order to meet your participant where they are.

**Give participants an exit strategy.** In your conversation guide, be sure to tell participants that they can pause or stop the session at any time, no questions asked. For example: "If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not lose your stipend or be penalized in any way if we need to stop." During the session, offer participants who are in distress an opportunity to gracefully exit the session. Thank them profusely for their feedback or for making the time to talk to you.

### Creating a safe space for research moderators 
It is also important that research moderators feel safe and secure while conducting user research. Prepare your own exit strategies in advance with your team. These may include identifying a backup moderator who can jump in if something happens to you, or drafting and practicing exits should you no longer feel comfortable to continue the session with the participant. Should an incident occur during the research session wherein the moderator no longer feels safe or capable to continue, follow the protocol below to request assistance.

1. Pause your research activity. 
2. Contact the recruiting team (Perigean) over Slack immediately. Please use the direct message set up by Lauren at the start of the study so that everyone is notified. 
3. Include a detailed description of the scenario in your slack message so that the recruiting team can respond appropriately. Do not be modest in your description; the details are necessary to determine appropriate next steps. As you are able, be available to answer questions. 
4. If you feel unsafe and want to end the session, use one of your practiced exit strategies to gracefully close the session. Let the participant know that the recruiting team will follow up with them. 
5. Inform the recruiting team that the session has been closed. 

Being made to feel unsafe or uncomfortable during user research can be a traumatizing experience.  Be sure to take time to pause and assess your own energy, emotional comfort, and capacity, and let your team know if you need any support. Consider a debrief with your team and/or the observers on the call as on opportunity to acknowledge this experience and consider how we can better support researchers and participants moving forward. 

#### Sample exit strategies
We recommend that you and your team plan for an exit strategy that you will feel comfortable using during a session. It is important not to blame the participant. Your goal is to simply wrap up the session without any further incident or escalation. We do not recommend sharing any personal details if you need to exit a session, as it may create additional stress for all. Examples of exit strategies that have worked include:
- **Out of questions**: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
- **Blame technology**: I am so sorry, but I just learned that the [website/prototype/thing I wanted to test with you today] is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the incovenience and thank you for your time.
