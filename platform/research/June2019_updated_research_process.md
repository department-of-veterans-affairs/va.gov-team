# Research Process (Updated June 2019)

## A few useful terms:
- *Project brief:* Completed by team lead or PM, outlines strategy and timeline for product. Should be a .md file stored in project folder.
- *Research plan:* Completed by designer; outlines goals, methodology, recruiting strategy, & synthesis plan for research; links to all related items (conversation guide, notes, recordings, synthesis documentation, report out). Replaces planning issue template. Should be a .md file stored in project's research folder and referenced in all research tickets. Having it as a .md file is good for documentation as it enables visibility into the team's research process and progress. 
- *Research issues/tickets:* GitHub Issues or ZenHub tickets created by each team to manage their process for research. 
- *Synthesis documentation:* Can be an Excel file, a link to Reframer, a Mural or Realtimeboard, a .md file: it should be whatever the designer needs it to be to anaylyze and evaluate research results and determine recommendations and next steps. Should live in the project research folder and be linked to from the research plan. 

## Before Research
1. **Make a research folder in your product's folder on GitHub.** All project-related research & elements should live in this folder, including:
  - Research plan
  - Conversation or discussion guide; outline of tree test, card sort, etc.
  - Notes and recordings
  - Synthesis
  - Readout 
  - Examples:
    - [Scheduling](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/master/Products/Health%20care/Scheduling/research)
    - [VIC](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/master/Products/Records/Veteran%20Identification%20Card%20v2/research) 
  
2. The **designer** should create a research plan: Create a new .md research plan file. Answer questions on new research plan [https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/research_plan_template.md](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/research_plan_template.md). This will become the doc you use to track everything, but also the documentation that project teams, research and UX lead, leadership, et al, can use to find your research in the future. Add anything you need to add to make this document work for you. If your team creates research issues and/or epics, you can cross-reference your xxxresearchplan.md file in that as well. 

3. [**Review the researcher checklist!**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Request%20or%20Do%20Research/lead-researcher-checklist-research-projects.md): Below are some common things that you should always plan to do. For a full checklist including reminders for before, during, and after sessions, review the checklist.

4. **Tell Your Colleagues!** 
- Share results in #vfs-all-teams, #design, in your product channels, at sprint demos, in design meetings. 
- [Update the research tracker](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Research%20History.md) so other researchers may apply your learnings going forward. 
- Does your research have design system pattern implications? Reach out to DSVA & Platform designers (i.e. Jared Cunha, Ryan Thurlwell, Emily Waggoner) to discuss. 

## Recruiting
### *Recruiting for moderated sessions with Veterans, service members, caregivers, and dependents:* 
DSVA has a recruiting contract with Perigean Technologies, a company that helps us recruit, screen, gather consent from, and schedule research sessions with Veterans. **If you want to leverage this option, email or slack Lauren Alexanderson (or Lacey Higley during July 2019) with the link to your research plan in the appropriate GitHub product folder at least 1 week prior to your desired start date** for remote sessions or **2 weeks prior to your desired start date for in-person sessions**.

If you are looking to do a card sort, tree test, chalkmark, or other test (NO SURVEYS or QUESTIONNAIRES allowed) and need to recruit a wider pool of Veterans, reach out to Lauren (or Lacey during July 2019). We may be able to help you tap into other options. 

- **Referrals for research** - If you meet a Veteran, caregiver, service member, or dependent who would be interested in participating in research, refer them to [https://veteranusability.us/](https://veteranusability.us/). 

- **In-person sessions** must be conducted in Washington DC, and the lead researcher is responsible for identifying and securing a location, and communicating that location back to Perigean. In past, teams have used contractors offices, public library spaces, and WeWork. We do not recommend running sessions in coffee shops and other public restaurants if you are planning to discuss a participant's PII or PHI. While you may use DSVA space for sessions, you need to make sure that you can get participants through security. This will add time and additional to your sessions, and may make your participant feel uncomfortable. 

- **Remote sessions** may be conducted using Zoom, Webex, or GoToMeeting. Perigean will provide login and account details. Use their accounts, not yours.  

### *Recruiting for VA staff, internal teams, or audiences not identified above:*
- DSVA does not have a contract for recruiting internal staff, VSOs, press, or other external audiences not identified above. Work with your stakeholders and product leads to identify and recruit these audiences. 

### *UAT Recruiting:* 
We have also developed a relationship with a team at VBA who have offered to partner with us on UAT recruitment. Please work with your DSVA team members to formally request their services via their TRT portal (must be done with VA email from VA PC): [https://vaww.infoshare.va.gov/sites/OBPI/TD/TestingRequestTracker/SitePages/Home.aspx](https://vaww.infoshare.va.gov/sites/OBPI/TD/TestingRequestTracker/SitePages/Home.aspx). This will trigger an initial conversation with Wilson Price and Casey Gordon. Please give them at least 2 weeks notice, and they will try to accommodate our requests, pending this intake conversation. If your timeline is tight, work with your team to evaluate how many users you actually need, and if you might be able to recruit more "guerilla" style by visiting a known Veteran hangout (e.g., Capitol Post) or working with Veterans on your team.

### Pre-Recruiting Checklist
- [ ] Designer completes research plan
  - Your research goals and methodology should be clearly defined before you should even think about recruiting. Ask your fellow designers if you need help with this. 
- [ ] Define what you are putting in front of users & when it will be ready. 
  - Give your content team plenty of time to review what you are testing and make changes. 
  - If you're testing something that engineers have to build, confirm that they will be done well before your first session.
  - Have the thing you're testing ready a week (min) before you start research. 
- [ ] Consider the user profiles you actually need to achieve your research goals. 
  - Discovery research, contextual inquiry, or UAT may require more specific participant personas (someone with a MHV Premium account or someone who has used secure messaging at the VA)   
  - You may be able to conduct card sorts, tree tests, usability tests, or content tests with broader participant types
- [ ] Assume a 2-week turnaround for gathering the right participants, but know that it can be harder & take longer if you are trying to find a very niche population. 

## Scheduling Sessions
- [ ] Refer to the [full checklist](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Request%20or%20Do%20Research/lead-researcher-checklist-research-projects.md) and resources in the [Scheduling & Running Sessions Folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Request%20or%20Do%20Research/Scheduling%20and%20Running%20Sessions) for specific guidance. 
- [ ] Involve your team & designers on other teams (as appropriate) in the research itself!
  - Always invite: Lauren Alexanderson (Lacey Higley during July 2019), your Team Lead, PM, content representatives, FE/BE engineers from your team,
  - Consider inviting: other designers and researchers, VA stakeholders. 

## Synthesis
 - If you have a preferred way of doing synthesis: consider how you might involve remote members of your team in that process, so they have buy-in to the outcomes. 
-	If you do NOT have a preferred way of doing synthesis or want help: ask fellow designers to work with you to come up with a plan. Include your sprint team! 
-	Plan to present your results: minimally, to your team & to fellow designers. You may also be asked to present at biweekly sprint demos, at PI research summaries, or with stakeholders. If you'd like to use existing templates:
  - In-depth readout template:
  - PI readout template: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Research%20Team%20Treehouse/PI%20Readouts/PI%20Readout%20Template.pptx

â€ƒ## UAT Guidelines
- This process should be led by designers and PMs. Remember, the purpose of user acceptance testing is to make sure things work. You may not need as many users as you do for usability (or you may need more if your use cases are varied).
- Work with your designer to determine test use cases: # of users & variety needed. 
- Keep in mind that user actions in UAT shouldn't have a permanent or lasting impact on a user's accounts or access to benefits. Determine upfront with any BE system if you can back out, delete, or otherwise flag UAT test applications/accounts.
- Reference UAT recruiting above. In addition to the VBA option, we are working on compiling a list of other resources for UAT whom you can reach out to directly.
