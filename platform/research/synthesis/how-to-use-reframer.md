# Consistent rules for Reframer

[**See also: How to do research synthesis**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/synthesis/how-to-do-research_synthesis.md)

*Why?*

[Reframer](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/reframer) can be a powerful tool for recording observations and helping researchers draw trends and conclusions across and through research sessions. Like any customizable tool, Reframer is only as helpful as the systems we build around it. Here we've set out some standards for how we can use it for our needs. We will revisit these guidelines regularly to make sure they still fit our requirements and reflect our usage.

*Anatomy of a Reframer Observation*

![reframer sample](https://ws3.sinaimg.cn/large/006tKfTcgy1fiu88t9eawj31b20giq5t.jpg)

- Tags: how we categorize what we hear. You can add as many as you like to any single observation. Tags can be grouped and color coded with tags for easier discovery. It is recommended that you create tags for your research questions (to evaluate if they were answered); for each significant page or component that you are testing (e.g. photo cropper, intro-page-instructions, 2FA step 1). Other helpful tag categories include user-reaction (i.e., painpoint, success, suggestion; different pages in a flow); success/failure (i.e. success, success with prompt, failure, did not attempt). 
- Review your session notes before you create tags, but create tags before you start coding. If multiple people are participating in synthesis, make sure to agree on your tags/codes before you start. A codebook is a helpful way to do this. [Here is a sample codebook](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Records/Veteran%20Identification%20Card%20v2/research/discovery/VeteranIdentificationCardv2_codebook_2018-01-13_20_23_10_filtered.xlsx)(__note: this link points to the vets.gov-team GitHub repo__) 
- Observations with quotation marks in them are automatically tagged as "quote"â€”be conscientious about how you use quotation marks in observations so we don't have non-quotes showing up in the quote tag.


*Why these matter: Themes*

In the "results" tab of Reframer, individual observations across sessions can be organized into themes by combining tags together and filtering for observations that have those tags.

![theme example](https://ws2.sinaimg.cn/large/006tKfTcgy1fiu8iyb6jpj31h414gn3r.jpg)

In this example, all observations tagged with the recovery key page and "painpoint" are filtered. This theme now shows all of the observed painpoints on the recovery key page. We can now look across this subset of all observations to find and share common frustrations across participants.

It is much easier to find these commonalities if we have a consistent understanding of when each tag should be applied.

## Open Question: What does significance mean to us?

A significance number can be assigned from 1 to 5 for any observation. Optimal Workshop suggests a few possibilities for how this number can be used:

- 1=Participant found this easy and 5=Participant found this difficult
- 1=Participant happy and 5=Participant frustrated
- 1=No pain point and 5=Significant pain point
- 1=No usability implications and 5=Serious usability implications 

What would we like it to be?

As an aside, significance comes into play when looking at themes/across tags, as these can be sorted in ascending or descending order by level of significance.

## Open Question: How do we want to use Tags?

- Something that we tried for organizing the first round of sign-up/identity testing was having a separate tag for each page of the flow. (I just wish we'd done it up front!) Each tag was "p#_whatpagedoes" so we knew where it was in the flow and what happened on the page. Is this a practice we want to continue?
- Optimal Workshop suggests an emergent model for tagging observations: take all the notes and read over them to see what topics come up, rather than creating tags and trying to tag during sessions.
- It might be helpful to write out some use cases for how we imagine using the tags for analysis?
    - Be able to quickly segment comments by whether they were painpoints or successes. 
    - When pulling painpoints, would like to further segment by the part of the design they refer to (e.g. a particular element "tabs" "submit button" "get help section") so we can see which element had the most negative comments and therefore is in most need of redesign.
    - When doing testing of an existing UI along side our new version, be able to segment comments for the old vs. new
    - When doing testing of an existing UI along side our new version, be able to compare # of positive and negative comments for the old vs. new.
    - We need to pull a (positive / negative) quote about something we tested for use in communicating with stakeholders
