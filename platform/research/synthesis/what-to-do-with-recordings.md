# Guidance on what to do with research recordings

## Guidelines

DSVA is adhering to the following guidelines for research recordings & consent forms: 
`This guideline was developed to advise investigators and help them with the responsibility of record retention. There are many ways in which record retention can be accomplished, but the following criteria are required: a) the confidentiality of the subject must be maintained; b) the records must be stored appropriately, locked, and accessible to only those listed in the approved study; c) the records including the signed informed consent forms are kept for at least 3 years (6 years if PHI); and d) the signed informed consent forms must be effectively destroyed and therefore no longer accessible to anyone. These requirements are the responsibility of the principal investigator and must be considered at all times.`

## What does this mean for me? 

- As of January 25, 2019, DSVA contractor Perigean Technologies maintains the accounts (Zoom, Webex, and GoToMeeting) for user research. Recordings are automatically stored in the cloud after the completion of a session. At the completion of the STUDY, Perigean will notify the lead researcher that they have 1 week to download any recordings they need to complete synthesis. Recordings will be subsequently deleted from Perigean's tools. 
- The lead researcher may keep the recordings for as long as needed to complete synthesis.
- Creating clips for communication and readout purposes is permitted, as long as the researcher uses video editing software to remove any PII or PHI from the clip (audio and visual). 
- Once the researcher is finished with the recording, they are required to securely dispose of it. 
- At no time is it permitted to store recordings in GitHub or any other cloud-sharing tool that an entire team or the general public can access. Clips that have been stripped of PII and PHI may be stored in the appropriate product research folder.
