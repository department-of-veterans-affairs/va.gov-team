# VA Research Findings Template Completion Guide

## Overview
This guide instructs Copilot on how to accurately populate the VA research-findings-template.md using completed UX research synthesis and analysis. The goal is to convert synthesized insights into a structured research report while maintaining fidelity to source material and avoiding extrapolation, representative data, or unsupported claims.

**Core Principle**: Every statement, quote, statistic, and recommendation in the completed template must be directly traceable to source research materials. Do not infer, extrapolate, approximate, or create "representative" information.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions Section

### Purpose
State assumptions tested during research and report findings about whether those assumptions were validated.

### Completion Instructions

**For each hypothesis:**

1. **Hypothesis statement**: 
   - Format: Clear, testable, specific statement
   - Example: "Veterans can complete the new appointment scheduling flow without assistance"
   - Source: Hypotheses should come from Research Plan or pre-research planning documents
   - **Use exact language from planning docs; do not paraphrase**

2. **Conclusion**: 
   - Choose ONE of these conclusions based on research evidence:
     - **Definitely True**: Evidence overwhelmingly supports hypothesis
     - **Likely True**: Evidence generally supports hypothesis with minor qualifications
     - **Likely False**: Evidence generally contradicts hypothesis
     - **Definitely False**: Evidence strongly contradicts hypothesis
     - **Maybe True**: Evidence is mixed or insufficient to determine
     - **Not enough information**: Research did not collect data to answer this hypothesis
   - **Do not use other conclusion types; stick to these six categories**

3. **Supporting evidence**:
   - Cite specific data: task completion rates, quote frequency, statistical results
   - Example: "12 of 12 participants (100%) completed the appointment scheduling task without assistance in under 3 minutes"
   - Include one exact verbatim quote if available, following quotation requirements
   - Reference specific findings that address this hypothesis
   - **Evidence must be directly from research data; do not infer or extrapolate**

### Format Example

```markdown
## Hypotheses and Conclusions

- **Hypothesis:** Veterans can easily understand the appointment availability calendar interface.
  - **Likely True**
  - Supporting evidence: 10 of 12 participants (83%) correctly identified available appointment slots on first attempt. P2 stated, "The calendar is pretty straightforwardâ€”I can see which days have openings." However, P7 and P11 initially tried to click on grayed-out dates, suggesting the visual distinction could be stronger.

- **Hypothesis:** Veterans prefer to filter appointments by location before viewing times.
  - **Definitely False**
  - Supporting evidence: All 12 participants filtered by time/availability first, then checked location. P5 commented, "I care about when I can go, the location is less important."
```

### What NOT to Include
- Hypotheses not actually tested in this research
- Conclusions not supported by data
- Hedging language like "it seems" or "one might argue" (use clear conclusion labels instead)
- New hypotheses generated during analysis (those belong in Further Research Needed)

---

## Key Findings Section

### Purpose
Present 5-10 of the most impactful, actionable findings from research synthesis.

### Completion Instructions

**Rules for Key Findings:**

1. **Limit to 5-10 findings** (prioritize; exclude supplementary insights)
   - These should be your highest-priority findings based on the Finding Prioritization Framework
   - If you have more than 10, move lower-priority findings to "Additional Insights" section

2. **Write as stand-alone, scannable statements**
   - Format: "[Who] [does/experiences/needs] [what] [why/context]"
   - Example: "Most participants used the search field to locate forms, often searching for 'veteran health'"
   - Example: "Participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"
   - **Each finding should be immediately understandable without reading the Details section**

3. **Lead with the insight, not the data**
   - Start with what it means, then support with evidence
   - Avoid: "8 of 12 participants had trouble with the form"
   - Better: "Participants struggled to understand form field labels because they use technical VA terminology"

4. **Write in clear, conversational language**
   - Avoid research jargon
   - Sound like something you'd say to a colleague
   - **Do not write in academic or technical language**

5. **Focus on user needs, pain points, and behaviors**
   - Each finding should relate to participant behavior, experience, or needs
   - Include the "so what"â€”why this matters
   - **Do not include findings that are interesting but not actionable**

6. **Base each finding on evidence threshold**
   - Trend findings: Affect >30% of participants or multiple research methods
   - Pattern findings: Affect 15-30% of participants
   - Notable findings: Affect <15% but have high severity or represent critical edge cases
   - **Do not include findings without clear evidence basis**

### Format Example

```markdown
## Key Findings

1. **Most Veterans start their search using broad terminology rather than official benefit names.** Participants commonly searched using language like "veteran health," "disability help," or "military retirement" rather than searching by official benefit categories. This suggests that navigation systems should accommodate common language patterns and provide translation to official terms.

2. **The current form layout causes confusion about which fields are optional vs. required.** 7 of 12 participants (58%) skipped fields they believed were optional but were actually required, leading to form submission errors. P3 stated, "I didn't realize that section was requiredâ€”there's no clear indicator."

3. **Veterans lack mental models for distinguishing between similar benefit types.** When asked to categorize VA benefits, participants frequently confused disability compensation with pension benefits (6 of 8 interview participants), suggesting these categories need clearer differentiation.

4. **Mobile users frequently abandon the application process after the first error message.** In mobile usability sessions, 4 of 6 participants who encountered an error did not attempt to correct it; instead, they closed the browser. In contrast, 10 of 12 desktop users persisted through errors.

5. **Participants value appointment confirmation through multiple channels but don't expect coordination between them.** When asked about appointment communications, participants expected separate email, text, and phone confirmations but did not realize these came from one system, leading to confusion when information conflicted.
```

3. **Supporting data** (use bullets; include 2-3 supporting elements per finding):

   a. **Exact verbatim quotes**:
   - Format: `_Supporting data: **P[number]**: "[exact quote]" (research method, date)_`
   - Each quote must be EXACT from transcript or written response
   - Include participant identifier and context
   - Example: `_Supporting data: **P4**: "I don't know the difference between 'disability compensation' and 'pension'â€”they sound the same to me" (semi-structured interview, 2025-10-15)_`
   - **Include 1-2 quotes per finding; do not use representative or paraphrased quotes**

   b. **Statistical data**:
   - Format: `_Supporting data: X of Y participants (Z%) [behavior/experience]_`
   - Use exact counts and percentages from research data
   - Example: `_Supporting data: 7 of 12 participants (58%) skipped at least one field they believed was optional_`

   - Example: `_Supporting data: During moderated usability testing, all participants using mobile devices attempted to pinch-zoom the form, indicating confusion about the layout_`
   - **Observations must come from session notes or video review; do not infer behavior**

### Format Example

```markdown
### Finding 1: Most Veterans start their search using broad terminology rather than official benefit names

Veterans commonly use informal language like "veteran health," "disability help," or "military retirement" when searching for benefits, rather than searching by official benefit category names. This pattern appeared consistently across both search query analysis and interview responses.

- _Supporting data: **P2**: "I just searched for 'veteran health stuff' and figured out what I needed from there" (usability test, 2025-10-22)_
- _Supporting data: Search analytics show 67% of queries for disability-related benefits use non-official terminology (analysis of past 90 days of search logs)_
- _Supporting data: **P5**, **P8**, and **P11** all used variations of "military retirement" when searching for retirement benefits, even though the official category is "VA Pension"_
```

### What NOT to Include
- Interpretations or conclusions (save for Recommendations)
- Comparative language like "most veterans" without data backing
- Speculative reasoning ("this probably means...")
- Details about individual participants beyond their feedback
- Paraphrased quotes (use only exact verbatim quotes or state "quote unavailable")

---

## Additional Insights Section

### Purpose
Include valuable observations that don't represent patterns but are still worth noting to stakeholders.

### Completion Instructions

**Include:**
- Powerful or memorable user comments that illuminate experience
- Unexpected behaviors or edge cases worth investigating
- Contradictions or outlier experiences
- Observations from only 1-2 participants but with high severity impact
- Unexpected positive moments or delight factors

**Rules:**

- Include exact quotes for individual comments
- Explain why this insight matters despite limited frequency
- **Do not include obvious or trivial observations**

**Format:**

```markdown
## Additional Insights

**One participant mentioned using the mobile app without any training.** P6 reported discovering features through trial and error: "I just started clicking around and figured out where everything was." While this was not a pattern (other participants sought help), it suggests some users are comfortable exploring without guidance.

**A participant with a visual disability found the screen reader support inadequate.** P12 (using NVDA screen reader) stated, "The form fields don't have clear labels, so the screen reader just reads 'input field' over and over. I can't tell which field is which." This represents a critical accessibility gap for the disability community.
```

---

## Recommendations Section

### Purpose
Provide specific, actionable recommendations for design and product decisions grounded in research evidence.

### Completion Instructions

**For each recommendation:**

1. **Recommendation statement**:
   - Format: Start with an action verb: "Implement...", "Update...", "Add...", "Revise...", "Consider...", "Test..."
   - Be specific: name the element, feature, or section you're recommending change to
   - Examples: "Implement synonym matching in search to support colloquial benefit terminology", "Update form field labels to use plain language instead of technical VA terms"
   - **Do not use vague language like "improve the user experience"**

2. **Supporting evidence**:
   - Reference the specific finding this recommendation addresses
   - Example: "This addresses Finding 3: Veterans lack mental models for distinguishing between similar benefit types"
   - Cite the data: "7 of 12 participants (58%) confused [X] with [Y]"
   - Include a quote if available: "As P3 noted, '[quote]'"
   - **Evidence must directly connect recommendation to research finding**

3. **Specific implementation details** (when applicable):
   - Reference specific VADS patterns, components, or systems
   - Example: "Use the VADS 'Alert' component to highlight required fields, updating the visual treatment from [current] to [proposed]"
   - Consider VA's existing tools and constraints
   - Example: "Implement within current form builder parameters; does not require new infrastructure"
   - Include success criteria or how to test
   - Example: "Test with 8-10 Veterans to validate that >80% identify all required fields without error"
   - **Be specific enough that a designer could implement without follow-up questions**

4. **Priority** (if you have multiple recommendations):
   - Label as "High Priority", "Medium Priority", or "Low Priority"
   - High Priority: Blocking task completion, critical usability issue, affects >30% of participants
   - Medium Priority: Affects 15-30% of participants or impacts user satisfaction
   - Low Priority: Affects <15% of participants or nice-to-have improvement

### Format Example

```markdown
## Recommendations

1. **Implement synonym matching in the search functionality to support colloquial benefit terminology** (High Priority)
   - Supporting evidence: This addresses Finding 1. Search analytics show 67% of queries use non-official terminology. As P2 noted, "I just searched for 'veteran health stuff' and figured out what I needed from there."
   - Implementation: Update the search algorithm to map common search terms ("health," "retirement," "mental health care") to official benefit categories. Use the existing search index but add a synonym layer in the current search service. This can be tested with the next 100 search queries by measuring whether searches using colloquial terms return relevant benefits.

2. **Revise form field labels to use plain language instead of technical VA terminology** (High Priority)
   - Supporting evidence: This addresses Finding 2. 7 of 12 participants (58%) skipped required fields, and P3 stated, "I didn't realize that section was requiredâ€”there's no clear indicator." During accessibility testing, P12 (screen reader user) reported, "The form fields don't have clear labels, so the screen reader just reads 'input field' over and over."
   - Implementation: Update all form field labels in the VADS form component system. Use plain language labels (e.g., "When do you want to start receiving benefits?" instead of "Effective date of claim"). Include clear required/optional indicators using both visual treatment (red asterisk) and programmatic labels for assistive technology. Pair with VBA team to ensure terminology aligns with backend systems. Test with at least 8 Veterans and 2 assistive technology users to validate that >85% correctly identify required fields and understand field purpose.

3. **Design a mobile-specific error recovery pattern** (High Priority)
   - Supporting evidence: This addresses Finding 4. In mobile usability sessions, 4 of 6 participants (67%) who encountered an error abandoned the application, whereas 10 of 12 desktop users (83%) persisted through errors.
   - Implementation: Create a new VADS mobile alert component that includes: (1) plain-language error message, (2) specific instruction on how to fix the error, (3) option to save progress and return later. Test with 6 mobile users to validate that >50% successfully recover from an error without abandonment.
```

### What NOT to Include
- Recommendations without supporting evidence
- Generic or aspirational recommendations ("make it better")
- Recommendations not grounded in findings
- Implementation details you cannot verify are feasible
- Recommendations that require speculation about technical constraints

## Product User and Business Outcomes Section

### Purpose
Connect research findings to the product's strategic goals and explain how this research supports desired outcomes.

### Completion Instructions

**Refer to the Product Outline for stated goals.**

**For Desired User Outcome:**
1. State the desired outcome from your Product Outline
   - Example: "Veterans can schedule appointments in under 5 minutes without assistance"
2. Explain how findings and recommendations support this outcome
   - Connect specific findings to progress toward this outcome
   - Example: "This research identified that [specific barrier] currently prevents this. Our recommendations to [specific changes] directly address this barrier. If implemented, [metrics] should improve."
3. **Do not create outcomes; use stated Product Outline outcomes**
4. **Only claim support for outcomes directly addressed by this research**

**For Desired Business Outcome:**
1. State the desired outcome from your Product Outline
   - Example: "Increase appointment scheduling completion rate from 65% to 85%"
2. Explain how findings support measurement or achievement of this outcome
   - Connect research to specific KPIs
   - Example: "Our findings on [barrier] and recommendations for [solution] directly address the top reason for abandonment. Implementation should increase completion rate by approximately [X]%."
3. **Use only business outcomes stated in Product Outline**
4. **Do not invent business metrics or projected impacts**

### Format Example

```markdown
## Product User and Business Outcomes

### Desired User Outcome
Enable Veterans to schedule VA appointments in under 5 minutes without assistance.

This research directly supports this outcome by identifying specific barriers that extend the scheduling time. Finding 2 identified that unclear form field labels cause Veterans to skip required fields, leading to submission errors and restarts. Finding 4 showed that mobile users abandon the process after encountering errors. Our recommendations to implement clearer labeling and mobile-specific error recovery directly address these time barriers. If implemented, we project the average time to completion will decrease from 8.3 minutes to under 5 minutes.

### Desired Business Outcome
Increase appointment scheduling completion rate from 65% to 85%.

This research supports achievement of this goal by identifying the top three abandonment points: (1) confusion about required fields (Finding 2), (2) lack of error recovery on mobile (Finding 4), and (3) unclear appointment selection interface (Finding 3). Each of our recommendations directly addresses one of these barriers. Based on the frequency of these issues, addressing all three should increase completion rate by approximately 15-20 percentage points.
```

## Key Performance Indicators Section

### Purpose
Explain how research findings will inform KPI measurement and demonstrate progress.

### Completion Instructions

**Refer to the Product Outline for listed KPIs.**

**For each relevant KPI:**

1. **State the KPI** (from Product Outline):
   - Example: "Task completion rate for appointment scheduling"
   - Example: "Average time to schedule an appointment"
   - Example: "Mobile vs. desktop completion rate"

2. **Explain how research supports measurement of this KPI**:
   - How will findings inform what to measure?
   - Example: "This research revealed that mobile users have a 67% abandonment rate vs. 17% for desktop users. We should establish separate completion rate KPIs for mobile and desktop to track whether our mobile-specific error recovery improves mobile completion."
   - Example: "Our finding that form field confusion causes 58% of participants to skip required fields demonstrates that measuring 'required field completion accuracy' is a critical KPI. We recommend establishing a baseline and tracking whether labeling improvements increase this metric."

3. **Connect to specific findings**:
   - Reference which finding motivated this KPI measurement
   - **Do not create new KPIs; only explain how to measure existing KPIs better**

4. **Do not project outcomes**; only explain measurement strategy

### Format Example

```markdown
## Key Performance Indicators

### KPI 1: Task Completion Rate for Appointment Scheduling
This research revealed distinct completion patterns between mobile and desktop users, with mobile users abandoning 67% of the time vs. 17% for desktop users (Finding 4). We recommend separating the overall completion rate KPI into mobile and desktop metrics to accurately track performance by platform. This will allow us to measure whether our mobile-specific error recovery recommendation improves mobile completion rates.

### KPI 2: Average Time to Schedule an Appointment
This research identified three barriers that extend scheduling time: unclear form labels, error recovery friction, and confusing appointment selection. We recommend establishing a baseline time-to-completion for the current interface (currently 8.3 minutes average), then tracking whether our recommendations reduce this time. We specifically recommend tracking time-to-completion by device (mobile vs. desktop) given the significant differences revealed in this research.

### KPI 3: Form Abandonment Rate by Point of Exit
This research pinpointed specific form sections where abandonment occurs (Finding 2: required field confusion; Finding 3: appointment selection confusion). We recommend implementing analytics to track where users exit the form. This will allow us to measure whether our recommendations for clearer labels and appointment interface improvements reduce abandonment at these specific points.

## Further Research Needed Section

### Purpose
Identify gaps in the current research and areas requiring additional investigation to make informed design decisions.

### Completion Instructions

**For each research gap:**

1. **Gap or question**: What remains unknown or ambiguous?
   - Example: "Whether Veterans on mobile devices would benefit from a 'save and return later' option more than desktop users"
   - Example: "How many different search terms Veterans use for disability-related benefits (only found 5 variations in current sample)"
   - Example: "Whether the form field label confusion affects all Veteran demographics equally or if it's specific to certain age groups or education levels"
   - **Do not include areas already thoroughly addressed in this research**

2. **Why this matters**: Why is this gap important?
   - Business impact: "This would inform whether to develop mobile-specific features"
   - User impact: "This would help us serve [user segment] better"
   - Strategic impact: "This would validate our approach before scaling"

3. **Suggested research approach** (optional):
   - "Follow-up study with [sample size] mobile users"
   - "Search analytics review for [specific query patterns]"
   - "A/B test [variation 1] vs. [variation 2] with [timeframe]"
   - **Do not detail full research plans; only suggest method and sample**

4. **Underrepresented groups**:
   - List demographic groups or user segments not adequately studied
   - Example: "Rural Veterans" (only 2 of 12 participants)
   - Example: "Veterans over 65" (only 1 of 12 participants)
   - Example: "Veterans using mobile devices exclusively" (conducted mainly on desktop in sessions)
   - **These should be populated from actual participant demographics**

## Further Research Needed

### Research Gaps

- **Mobile-specific user needs**: This research primarily tested desktop and mobile use in lab settings. We need to understand mobile usage in real-world contexts (commuting, waiting for appointments). Suggested approach: Mobile diary study with 8-10 Veterans using the mobile app in their natural environment over 2 weeks.

- **Appointment selection mental models**: We found Veterans confused between appointment types but didn't deeply explore how they differentiate between in-person, virtual, and phone appointments. This matters for designing the appointment selection interface. Suggested approach: Follow-up interviews with 6-8 Veterans exploring their understanding of appointment type differences.

- **Search term variations**: Search analytics showed 67% of queries use non-official terminology, but we only identified 5 common variations in our sample. We need comprehensive search term analysis to ensure synonym mapping covers the full range. Suggested approach: Analytics review of past 6 months of search logs to identify all unique search term patterns.

### Underserved Groups Not Yet Studied

- **Rural Veterans**: Only 2 of 12 participants were from rural areas. Rural Veterans may have different constraints (limited facility options, travel distance) affecting appointment scheduling prioritization.
- **Veterans over 65**: Only 1 of 12 participants was over 65. This group may have different technical proficiency or accessibility needs.
- **Veterans with cognitive disabilities using assistive technology**: No participants in this study used speech input technology. This group may face additional barriers.
- **Non-English speaking Veterans**: No non-English speakers were included. Language may affect understanding of field labels and error messages.

### Underserved Groups We Haven't Talked To

This research does not include adequate representation of the following marginalized Veteran groups:

* **Rural Veterans**: Recruited 2 of 8 target (75% gap). Rural Veterans may have different constraints around facility access and appointment availability that weren't fully explored in this research.
* **Veterans 65+**: Recruited 2 of 6 target (67% gap). Older Veterans may face different technology barriers and accessibility needs not reflected in findings.
* **Veterans with hearing disabilities**: Recruited 0 of 4 target (100% gap). No Veterans with hearing disabilities participated, meaning we cannot speak to caption needs or alternative communication preferences.
* **Veterans with cognitive disabilities**: Recruited 1 of 5 target (80% gap). Findings about form complexity and error recovery may not reflect needs of Veterans with cognitive processing differences.
* **Non-English speaking Veterans**: Recruited 0 of 3 target (100% gap). Language accessibility needs were not assessed in this research.

**Recommendation**: Follow-up research should specifically target these underserved groups to ensure design recommendations serve the full Veteran population.
