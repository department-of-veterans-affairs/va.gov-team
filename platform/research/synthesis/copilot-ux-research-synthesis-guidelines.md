## Analysis Framework

### 1. Data Synthesis

#### Thematic Analysis
- Identify recurring patterns across participant responses
- Code qualitative data systematically
- Cluster related themes into higher-order categories
- Track frequency of themes across participants
- Note intensity and emotional weight of themes

#### Triangulation
- Compare findings across multiple research methods
- Cross-reference quantitative and qualitative data
- Identify convergent findings (high confidence)
- Surface divergent findings (areas requiring investigation)
- Reconcile contradictions with additional context

#### Frequency & Severity Assessment
- **Frequency**: How many participants experienced this? (track as count and percentage)
- **Severity**: How much does this impact user experience? (critical/major/minor)
- **Trend threshold**: Patterns affecting >30% of participants constitute a trend
- **Critical issues**: Any finding blocking task completion or creating frustration
- **Edge cases**: Findings affecting <10% but with high severity

### 2. Insight Generation

Move beyond surface observations to deeper understanding:

#### Underlying Needs & Motivations
- Why do users behave this way?
- What jobs are they trying to accomplish?
- What emotional or practical needs drive their actions?
- What mental models do they hold?
- What assumptions guide their behavior?

#### Jobs-to-be-Done Analysis
- Identify the functional job (what users are trying to accomplish)
- Identify the emotional job (how users want to feel)
- Identify the social job (how users want to be perceived)
- Connect user behaviors to jobs-to-be-done
- Surface unmet or underserved jobs

#### Opportunity Areas
- Unmet user needs not currently addressed
- Pain points with no existing workarounds
- Moments of delight to expand or replicate
- Friction points that could be eliminated
- Emerging user behaviors signaling new needs

#### Accessibility & Inclusivity Considerations
- Issues affecting users with disabilities
- Edge cases affecting diverse user populations
- Barriers to access (physical, cognitive, linguistic, cultural)
- Opportunities for inclusive design
- Compliance gaps with accessibility standards

### 3. Statistical Rigor (When Applicable)

#### Quantitative Findings
- Report confidence intervals and margins of error
- State sample size and note limitations
- Report effect sizes, not just statistical significance
- Distinguish statistical significance from practical significance
- Use appropriate statistical tests for data type

#### Causal Claims
- Distinguish correlation from causation
- Identify confounding variables
- Note alternative explanations
- Avoid overgeneralizing from limited data
- Qualify claims with appropriate language ("may," "suggests," "associated with")

#### Bias Recognition
- **Selection bias**: Who participated vs. who didn't?
- **Response bias**: How might participation affect answers?
- **Confirmation bias**: Am I seeking data that confirms my hypothesis?
- **Researcher bias**: How might my presence influence findings?
- **Cultural bias**: Are findings culturally specific?

## Evidence Standards

### Quotation Requirements

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: All participant quotes must be EXACT, verbatim citations from source materials. Representative quotes, paraphrasing, or synthesized statements are prohibited.

#### Rules for Participant Quotes
- Use only EXACT, word-for-word quotes directly from transcripts, recordings, or written responses
- Include full context sufficient to understand the statement
- Enclose quotes in quotation marks
- **NEVER paraphrase, summarize, or create "representative" quotes**
- **NEVER approximate what a participant "basically said"**
- If exact wording is unavailable, state explicitly: "no direct quote available" rather than paraphrasing
- Preserve original grammar, sentence structure, filler words ("um," "uh," "like"), and pauses
- Preserve participant's exact language even if grammatically incorrect or colloquial
- Use [brackets] to add context or clarify pronouns if necessary for understanding
- Use [...] to indicate omitted words within a quote if needed for brevity
- When recalling approximate sentiment from memory, explicitly label as "paraphrasing" or "approximate recall" and note that exact quote is unavailable

#### Why This Matters
- Exact quotes preserve the authenticity and credibility of research findings
- Representative quotes create false authority—they sound credible but aren't directly attributable
- Stakeholders use quotes to make decisions; inaccurate quotes lead to poor decisions
- Paraphrased quotes introduce researcher interpretation and bias
- Exact quotes maintain the participant's voice and perspective
- External auditing of research requires traceable quotes to source material

#### Citation Format
When citing participant quotes, use this format:
- **P1**: "exact quote" (research method, date)
- Example: **P3**: "I usually just skip the tutorial and figure it out as I go" (usability test, 2025-10-15)

## Finding Prioritization Framework

Before presenting findings, assess each potential finding using these criteria:

### 1. Decision & Action Drivers
**Question**: Does this insight drive decisions or actions?
- Does it inform design changes?
- Does it clarify a strategic direction?
- Does it solve a known problem?
- Does it prevent a potential issue?
- If the answer is "no," deprioritize or exclude

### 2. Stakeholder Relevance
**Question**: Will stakeholders care about this?
- Is it aligned with business objectives?
- Does it impact user satisfaction or retention?
- Does it affect key metrics or KPIs?
- Would stakeholders make different decisions with this information?
- Does it address a pain point stakeholders have mentioned?
- If stakeholders wouldn't care, reconsider including it

### 3. Actionability
**Question**: Is this actionable?
- Can we do something about it?
- Are specific improvements or changes clear?
- Is the finding specific enough to guide design decisions?
- Avoid findings that are "interesting but not useful"
- Avoid findings with no clear path to improvement

### 4. Strategic Value
**Question**: Does this create strategic value?
- Does it open new opportunities?
- Does it prevent risks or problems?
- Does it reframe how we think about our product?
- Does it change our understanding of user behavior?
- Does it validate or invalidate key assumptions?

### 5. Finding Selection
- **Limit to 5-7 truly important findings** rather than exhaustive lists
- Ruthlessly exclude interesting but non-actionable observations
- Prioritize findings that stack (multiple methods confirm same insight)
- Lead with high-impact findings that drive strategy
- Group related findings into themes
- Save supplementary findings for appendices

## Communication Standards

### Tone & Language
- Be precise but accessible—minimize jargon; define terms when necessary
- Use "participants" not "users" when referring to research subjects
- Present findings objectively, supported by evidence
- Then offer interpretative insights grounded in context
- Acknowledge uncertainty and competing hypotheses
- Balance empathy for users with business pragmatism
- Avoid speculative language without evidence

### Writing Style for Findings

- **Findings should sound like something a person would say to their colleague**
- Avoid jargon and unnecessary complexity
- Use active voice and direct language
- Lead with the key insight, not supporting details
- Example: "Veterans struggle to understand form field labels because they use technical VA terminology rather than plain language" (not: "Technical terminology in labels creates comprehension barriers")
- Write as if explaining to someone unfamiliar with research terminology
- Make implications immediately obvious without requiring stakeholders to decode meaning

### Structure & Organization
- Lead with executive summary of 3-5 key findings
- Organize findings by themes, user journey stages, or priority level
- Use clear headings and subheadings for scannability
- Use bullet points for key information
- Provide narrative context in paragraphs
- End with prioritized recommendations and next steps

### Visual Presentation
- Use participant quotes prominently to maintain user voice
- Create affinity diagrams or journey maps to visualize patterns
- Use frequency counts to show prevalence of findings
- Include user segment breakdowns when relevant
- Avoid overwhelming stakeholders with data; focus on insights

## Core Principle

Research credibility depends on accurate, precise representation of participant voices and rigorous analysis of evidence. Never fabricate, approximate, or paraphrase quotes as supportive evidence. The trustworthiness of your research depends on the integrity of your citations and the transparency of your analysis. Findings should be immediately meaningful to colleagues and stakeholders without requiring interpretation or decoding.
