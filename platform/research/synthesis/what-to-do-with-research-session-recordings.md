# Recording User Research Sessions 

As of January 25, 2019, DSVA contractor Perigean Technologies maintains the accounts (Zoom, Webex, and GoToMeeting) for user research. Recordings are automatically stored in the cloud after the completion of a session. At the completion of the study, Perigean will notify the lead researcher that they have 1 week to download any recordings they need to complete synthesis. Recordings will be subsequently deleted from Perigean's tools. 
- The lead researcher may keep the recordings for as long as needed to complete synthesis.
- Creating clips for communication and readout purposes is permitted, as long as the researcher uses video editing software to remove any PII or PHI from the clip (audio and visual). 
- Once the researcher is finished with the recording, they are required to securely dispose of it. 
- At no time is it permitted to store recordings in GitHub or any other cloud-sharing tool that an entire team or the general public can access. Clips that have been stripped of PII and PHI may be stored in the appropriate product research folder. 

## May I record sessions? 
Yes, **IF** the particpant gives you permission to do so. 

1. In the introduction to your session, you must **ASK** for permission **BEFORE** you start recording.
2. You must explain how the recording will be used. 
3. Once you start recording, you must let the participant know that they are being recorded and have them acknowledge that they give permission. 

See the conversation guide template for sample language. 

## Guidelines
DSVA is adhering to the following guidelines for research recordings & consent forms: 
`This guideline was developed to advise investigators and help them with the responsibility of record retention. There are many ways in which record retention can be accomplished, but the following criteria are required: a) the confidentiality of the subject must be maintained; b) the records must be stored appropriately, locked, and accessible to only those listed in the approved study; c) the records including the signed informed consent forms are kept for at least 3 years (6 years if PHI); and d) the signed informed consent forms must be effectively destroyed and therefore no longer accessible to anyone. These requirements are the responsibility of the principal investigator and must be considered at all times.`

## What do I do with the recording when I'm done with the session?
Depending on which tool you're using for research (i.e. Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex, etc.) you will have options for downloading the recording. Download the recordings you will need to your hard drive to use for synthesis and notes. When you are done with synthesis, *securely discard* the recordings. DO NOT POST recordings to Slack or GitHub. 

## What if I want to keep a clip from the session for a presentation or other communication purpose? 
- We need to get permission from the participant to use their recording in any way beyond research synthesis. To do this, reach out to Lauren Alexanderson. 
- You also need to crop the session recording to the shortest possible clip you can make and scrub out all PII and PHI using video and audio editing software. 

## Scrubbing recorded research sessions of PII & PHI

These are instructions for scrubbing videos of PII and/or PHI (referred to as PII from here on). Removing a user's personal and/or health information is important for anonimity and identity protection. If you are conducting research and the user has provided any combination of the following, the video needs to be scrubbed of:

- Names
- Address (whole or part)
- Phone Numbers
- Fax numbers
- Email addresses
- Social Security numbers
- General educational credentials
- Dates (other than year) directly related to an individual

*When in doubt, scrub it out: If you aren't sure if something qualifies as PII, you should consider scrubbing it from the video before socializing.*


### How to Scrub

This 4-part technique uses a combination of iMovie, screenshots, and photo editing software capable of blurring images. 

#### Part 1: Import & Screenshot

1. Import the video file to iMovie.
2. Save this file before you do anything else!
3. Navigate to the section of the recording containing PII. 
4. Mark the instances where the PII happens. 

*Pro-tip: each time the PII moves, add a new marker. This will help in Part 3: Import & Overlay.*

5. Screenshot the are of the screen that contains PII. 

*Pro-tip: if there are multiple places where PII occurs, try to get all of them in the same screenshot. This will make aligning the screenshot with blurred PII and the video easier in later steps.*


#### Part 2: Blur PII

6. Open the screenshot in a photo editing program (Photoshop, Sketch, Preview, Pixelmator, etc.).
7. Isolate the PII using the selector.
8. Blur that PII real good. 
9. Repeat steps 7 & 8 for all instances of PII on that page. 
10. Export as PNG.


#### Part 3: Import & Overlay

This is probably the most complex, tedius part of the process. You will get frustrated on your first try, but you'll be a pro after you've done it once. 

11. Import the blurred screenshot to iMovie and align with part of the clip you wish to cover. (This is where those markers you made in Part 1: Import & Screenshot come in handy)
12. Choose "Picture in Picture".
13. Resize and align the screenshot.
14. You'll need to repeat steps 11, 12, & 13 every time the PII moves (e.g. if the user scrolled and it's higher on the screen). Copy & paste the screenshot already in iMovie and reposition, as needed. 


#### Part 4: Export & Distribute

Pat yourself on the back—-the hard part is over! Now all you need to do is get your PII-free user session out of iMovie and distriubute it to the team. 

15. iMovie File > Share > File
16. From this view, you'll be able to customize the export. Choosing a lower resolution and quality will help reduce file size, export, and upload time.
17. Distribute accordingly! (Read: it's accessible from Github as a file or slack file is linked)
