# Trauma-Informed Research Plan TEMPLATE for [Team, Product, Date]
*Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the #research-ops Slack channel.* 

## Background
Briefly describe the background of your product. Consider:
- What problem is your product trying to solve?
- Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)
- What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?

[Link to product brief](url goes here).

### OCTO Objectives 

Which [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 

## Research Goals	
What are you trying to learn from this research? 

*Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.* 

### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

### Research questions
Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:
- What will I do with what I learn from this question?
- Does this question serve the goals of my study?
- Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md) 

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

## Method	
Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design. 

Examples of common research methods include: 
- Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research
- Contextual inquiry - appropriate for generative research
- Card sorts - appropriate for generative and evaluative research; depending on the study design 
- Tree tests - appropriate for evaluative research
- Usability testing - appropriate for evaluative research
- User acceptance testing (UAT) - required before product release

Additional resources:
- Please review the [PRA primer](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/what-is-paperwork-reduction-act.md) to educate yourself on how PRA impacts the research we do as a government project. 
- Review the [Perigean recruitment guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md) to understand how Perigean recruits, and what types of research they can support. 
- If conducting testing on mobile, refer to the [mobile research guidelines.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/mobile-research-guidelines.md)
- If conducting [unmoderated user research, refer to the guidance here.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/unmoderated-research-guidance.md) 
- If conducting [research with disabled Veterans, refer to this checklist.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/assistive-tech/research-checklist.md) 

### Trauma-informed research 
*(Describe why it's important to take a trauma-informed approach to your research and what you plan to do)*

Because [TOPIC] is a potentially triggering subject, we want to be careful about recruiting people to participate in this research because we don't want to re-trigger the trauma they have experienced. Our plans include the following:
- Provide an overview of the session for Perigean personnel to share with potential participants and then ask if they are comfortable participating.
- Talk with your Product Owner or OCTO about how you could include a social worker or other clinician in each session to provide support if trauma-triggering occurs.  
- Limit the number of observers in the session to **one** team member (plus the moderator, a clinician, and a notetaker for a total of 4 people in the Zoom room with the participant). Plan to get consent from the participant while the observer is in the Zoom waiting room; if the participant gives consent, then let the observer in.
  - For each session with a participant using a screen reader, invite an accessibility specialist instead of the team observer to assist with any technical issues.
- Request a content review of all Veteran-facing language in the research plan and conversation guide.
- Schedule daily debrief meetings with the team to share observations and decompress, and encourage team members to attend.
- Consider sharing session moderation with another researcher so that you can take turns moderating.

### Location
Where will you be holding the research sessions? Be sure to include whether this is remote or in-person research. [Learn more about setting up in-person research.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/planning-in-person-research.md)

If remote, include your preferred video conferencing software. Choice of: Zoom, GoTo Meeting; WebEx.

If in person, include:
- Location
- Point of contact
- Equipment used for research

### Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 

Pro tip:
- For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants. 
- Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

**Additional questions to ask in the screener**

*(We recommend sharing with potential participants what the topic is and what you want them to do before they decide whether to participate. Below are some sample questions.)*
1. VA is working to [DO ACTION RELATED TO TOPIC]. As part of these efforts, we are exploring [WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON]. Feedback from Veterans like you will help us make sure that [WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON] will meet your needs and are easy to use. Are you interested in trying out [WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON] and sharing your opinions about them? 
    1. No *(don't recruit)*
    2. Yes *(ask the next question)*
1. First, we want to stress that we’re contacting you because you’re a Veteran, not because we believe that you have been [TOPIC]. We also want to make sure everyone who participates in a feedback session knows exactly what to expect so you can decide if you’re comfortable participating. If you’ve experienced any type of [TOPIC] in the past, conversations in the feedback session might remind you of these past experiences. Our researcher may also ask you a few questions about whether you’ve experienced [TOPIC]. They won’t ask you to share any details about the experience. And you can choose to answer only questions you’re comfortable answering or end the session at any time. We won’t share what you tell us in a feedback session with anyone, and we won’t link your name or other personal details with your answers in any of our records. Would you feel comfortable participating in this feedback session? 
    1. No *(don't recruit)*
    2. Yes *(recruit)*

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)

Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
What dates do you plan to do research? 

### Length of sessions
How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. 

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 
Please request enough dates and time slots for the number of requested participants (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). 

Request that Perigean schedule the sessions with buffer time to enable the researcher to debrief and decompress before the next session. For trauma-informed research, we recommend scheduling as much time as the researcher needs between sessions to recover, even if it means conducting only one session per day (or every other day). As a minimum, we recommend *at least 60-90 minutes buffer time between sessions, and a maximum of 2-3 sessions per day.*
	
## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:	
- Note-takers:	
- Clinicians: 
- Observers: Will be invited directly by the Moderator because we need to limit the number of observers per session.
