# How to Take Good Session Notes

## Primary Notetaker
Each session should have a primary notetaker. This ideally should be a team member, but could also be a fellow designer, a content person. The primary notetaker's goal is to take verbatim notes. Do not input your observations/feelings/solutions in the notes. You can do this via Excel, Word, a .md file, Handrail, or any other way that works for you. 

- File naming for verbatim notes: **Participant#.researchstudy notes.date and time** (P1.personalizationusability notes.201706041300 = Participant 1, personalization usability study notes, June 4, 2017 at 1pm.)

## Secondary Notetaker(s)
Anyone else who observes is encouraged to note observations throughout the session. Designers will ask all observers at the end of a session to share their observations. Please note, there's a difference between an observation (what a participant said or did) and a recommendation ("We should make Y change...") Your notes should be recommendations and specific quotations that stuck out. 

- Share your observations with the designer in the [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel) or in the [#vetsdotgov-research](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/vetsdotgov-research) channel.
