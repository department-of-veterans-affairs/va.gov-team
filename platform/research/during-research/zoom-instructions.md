# How To Use Zoom for User Research

## Login Information
- Perigean will send you the login instructions for using Zoom accounts for user research. The first time you use their account you will need to coordinate with Perigean on 2FA. 

## Presenter Role:
After logging in, you will be logged in as a presenter (be sure to enter your name). As a presenter, you are able to: 
- Share your full screen or window
- Give mouse control to participants
- Mute all observers on the call
- Record any meetings/and or feedback sessions

## Things to know during a feedback session: 
- Be sure you have silenced the sounds (be-boops) as observers enter or exit the session
- You can set meeting preferences by clicking the gear icon. Under General settings, select View advanced features. Make sure that Play sound when participants join or leave is not selected.
- If you want to record the participant's screenreader audio, the "Share computer sound" checkbox must be selected when they share their screen.

## How to obtain Zoom recordings
- When you select the Record button, Zoom will prompt you to either save the recording to the cloud or save it locally. 
- If you choose save it locally, after you end a meeting/or feedback session, Zoom will automatically convert the recording and save it to your computer. **You are responsible for securely discarding the recording one week after you have completed synthesis.** 
- Do NOT upload recordings to GitHub or Slack. 
  
## Zoom Assistive Tech Checklist & Troubleshooting

### Participant technical setup questions

* Are you using a computer or mobile phone during our session today? Mac or Windows? iOS or Android?
* If the participant is dialing into the Zoom meeting: Can you put me on speaker?
* If the participant is using a computer, and you’re asking them to sign in on production during the session: Do you have your phone handy? You may need it to receive a 2-factor authorization code before you log in.
* Are you wearing headphones today? If so, would it be possible for you to take them off and use your computer or mobile audio? I'm asking so that I can hear your screen reader during the session.
* Would you mind setting your screen reader to its default speed? We want to accurately hear and record what you’re experiencing on VA.gov.
* What browser are you using?
* What screen reader are you using?
* Are you using a screen magnifier?
* Do you know your screen reader's verbosity setting? High, medium, low?

### Troubleshooting
**If the participant is in the Zoom meeting, but cannot find the Share button**, guide them with the following instructions: 

1. The participant should alt-tab until they are sure they are in the Zoom meeting window (announcement should be something like "Zoom Meeting ID:...") 
2. Tab forward until they hear "Share button". Press enter
3. If this doesn't work, it's likely because the meeting toolbar auto-hid. To unhide the toolbar, the user needs to press "Alt", and try step 2 again. 
4. Their focus will move to a new window with sharing options. They should tab forwards until they hear "Share Screen button". Press enter
5. At this point participant should be sharing screen.

**If the participant wishes to stop screen sharing**, they must put focus back onto Zoom meeting window, press F6 until they hear "Meeting Controls window", and tab forwards until they hear the "Stop share button"

**If the participant doesn’t have Zoom installed**, guide them to install it using the following instructions:
1. Go to the following link to download the installer: https://zoom.us/client/latest/ZoomInstaller.exe 
The installer should install the application without any required keystrokes. 
2. Tab twice to reach the Join a Meeting button, activate the button. 
3. Enter the meeting ID into the "Meeting ID or Personal Link Name" field. 
4. Press tab about six times until you reach the Join button. Activate it. 
5. If the meeting hasn't started yet you will be presented with a dialog with static text. You may tab through this dialog to confirm the date/time of meeting and topic. 
6. At this point, you should have successfully joined the meeting. You will officially enter the meeting room when the meeting time comes.
