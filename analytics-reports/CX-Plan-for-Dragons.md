# Current State of CX measurement plan for transition to Dragons Team 8/22/2018

## Current VA.gov ForeSee Site Intercept Survey
Today, va.gov has an account with ForeSee to collect customer feedback via a web intercept survey. This includes both their standard model questions (which they use to calcluate the all-powerful Satisfaction Score) and custom questions defined by VA. We are currently working with the ForeSee representatives to edit the custom questions to create a baseline measurement for va.gov (pre-merger). Tony Whittaker has been working on edits to the survey questions. ForeSee manages PRA for all the surveys they deliver on a roughly 2 week approval timeline.

## Preview.va.gov ForeSee Site Intercept Survey
We plan to continue the use the Site Intercept Survey when we switch over to the AWS environment. This will allow for continuit of the survey measure and allow us to compare our baseline to the post-merger environment. Key metrics will include overall satisfaction, use of other VA websites, accomplish primary task, etc. Mina has the email from ForeSee about how to implement this survey on preview.va.gov.

## Vets.gov Pilot ForeSee Comment Card
In a parrallel track, we are piloting ForeSee's Comment Card (in-page survey) on vets.gov. Steve volunteer Dragon's as a great place to start this pilot because he was already looking for a way to collect data about Personalization. We are planning to implement this Comment Card on authenticated pages on vets.gov. There is currently no plan to implement the Comment Card on va.gov post-merger. Steve has the info from ForeSee about implementing the comment card. ForeSee manages PRA for updates to the comment card on a roughly 2 week approval timeline.

## Vets.gov Pilot Medallia flyout survey
The Veteran's Experience Office has been working to stand-up a capability to use Medallia's digital portal comment card (also called a flyout survey). This team launched their new environment 8/15 and plans to have the new comment card live on vets.gov 9/15. They have been coordinating with Bill Tran on this roll-out plan. To limit issues wth the ForeSee roll-out, we are planning to implement the Medallia survey only on un-authenticated pages of vets.gov. VEO maanges the PRA approval for the portal comment card.



Conclusion: By piloting both ForeSee and Medallia we will be able to determine the best path forward for a feedback comment card on VA.gov. In the meantime we will have a secure plan to collect baseline data for the new site via the web intercept survey.
