# Impact Reviews

Impact Reviews are a monthly exercise  where we take time to intentionally reflect on and share the measurable impact of our work and discuss how we can leverage results to drive future decision-making.

If your team has launched a new product, feature or enhancement in recent months we’d love to hear from you! The goal of Impact Reviews is to take some time to reflect on the measurable impact of our work to help stay focused on the “why”, discuss what has worked in our efforts (and what hasn’t!), make data driven decisions and collaborate across teams. We discuss the problem your team was trying to solve, your goals, how you attempted to solve it, the outcome, and suggestions for next steps.

## How can I participate?
Impact Reviews take place the first Thursday of each month at noon ET via zoom. If you’re interested in attending, please reach out in the **#impact-review** slack channel in the DSVA workspace to be added to the invite, or to discuss getting on the schedule to present. 

As a presenter, time commitment is minimal - about 15 minutes or so filling out a pre-formatted deck for a ~12 minute presentation. 

As an attendee, simply attend the presentation and engage in discussion. 

Curious what an Impact Review is like but not ready to commit to presenting? Check out our slack channel where you can review (and watch) past presentations posted in the chat.

## Upcoming Presentations
If you're interested in presenting reach out to Anastasia Jakabcin via DM in the DSVA workspace or in the #impact-review channel, and add your team's details to the table below. Generally we aim to have no more than _two_ initiatives presented each month to allow enough time for discussion.
