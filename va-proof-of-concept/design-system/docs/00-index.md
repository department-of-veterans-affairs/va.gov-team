title: Welcome to Formation!
---

The design system (affectionately named “Formation”) is a Fractal implementation for Vets.gov. It’s based on USWDS’ own system, and modified for the unique needs of Vets.gov.

Vets.gov has a collection of components that make up the website. These components have a visual styleguide associated with them, as well as reviewed and refined code that drives them, and best practices for when to use them. Formation is a single source of documentation and truth for people looking to use the Vets.gov components.

Formation’s purpose is to provide accepted guidance for:

- code implementations for existing components
- visual design for existing components
- use guidelines for existing components (when and when not to use a thing)
- implementation of new visual patterns and components

## Get started:

## To Do:

- incorporate Vets CSS
- Get the CSS working properly
- Incorporate documentation for Foundation grid
- Match styles:
  - ~~Tables~~
  - Fonts
  - Alerts
  - ~~Accordions~~
  - Header -- so broken.
  - Footer
  - Links
  - Buttons > Primary Alt (replace with green)
  - Buttons > Secondary (replace with outline)
  - Serif font: Bitter


- Add components that we _are_ using on Vets that are not on USWDS (what are these?)
  - Subway map
  - Logos
  - Grey callouts
  - Blue cards (deprecated?)
  - Need help? sidebar/footer
  - Iconography
  - ~~Header > Get Help (VCL)~~
  - Homepage template (unsure whether to break this down into smaller components, since so many of them _only_ live on Home)
  - Navigation > Next/prev
  - Log in landing page (prompt to ID.me)
  - Alert/accordion hybrid (see Prescription Refills)
  - Data visualizations
  - Add Source Sans Pro Bold
  - Responsive table
  - Expandable alert box (https://www.vets.gov/health-care/health-conditions/mental-health/)
