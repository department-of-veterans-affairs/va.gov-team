## VA.gov content style guide - audit, research folder

This folder contains:
- Excel spreadsheet of inventory of existing VA content style guides/guidance (most of them print or public affairs focused; or broadly digital - social, video, blogs; and mostly governance oriented rather than usage guidance).
- Current style guides from DOD, OPIA, and OIG.
