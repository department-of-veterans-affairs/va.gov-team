# URL Work for New VA.gov
**July 2018**

These are broad groupings of URL-related work, for both design and development, that need to be considered. This list may not be inclusive of everything that needs to happen, nor does it articulate how to do it.

### 1. Create (and build/connect together) new page URLs for all existing Vets.gov pages

**Design status:** Complete

**Development status:** In progress

- New URL schemas for each of the 9 benefits hubs
- New URLs for standalone content pages and tools
- New URLs for Vets.gov/VA.gov account home ('My VA') and account health portal ('My Health')

### 2. 

**Design status:** 

**Development status:** 


### 3. Create 1:1 mappings for each existing Vets.gov URL to be redirected to each new VA.gov URL

**Design status:** 

**Development status:** 

- An onboarding modal should pop up after redirect that explains that Vets.gov is now part of VA.gov

### 4. Create list of existing VA.gov URLs that should be changed

**Design status:** 

**Development status:**

- This list should be recommendations for new URLs for existing VA.gov URLs that may be confusing to users
  - Example: VA.gov/health should change to VA.gov/vha so users don't accidentaly go there instead of the new Health Care benefit hub (VA.gov/health-care)
- We will need to work with our stakeholders on reviewing and approving these changes (they will need to consider and plan for internal administration change management)
- We will need to work with OI&T on impementation
- We are not dealing with subdomains right now

### 5. Create list of existing VA.gov URLs with benefits content that should be retired

**Design status:** 

**Development status:**

- This list should include the old/existing VA.gov URL and the new VA.gov URL that has the benefits content (i.e., we need to track and show parity)
- We should create a master spreadsheet for each of the 9 benefit hubs and give them to our stakeholders for their review and approval (they will need to consider and plan for internal administration change management)
- We should consider creating redirects to eavh benefit hub page for these old URLs, for users who may have bookmarked these pages
- We will need to work with OI&T on retiring these pages and URLs
