Conducting this study in-person onsite at VA medical centers. Logistics will vary based on site.

- For the Durham site visit we are planning two teams, one looking at mobile and one at desktop. Both teams will use the same guide.

## Task 1 Homepage - 5 min

*Navigate user to* *https://preview.va.gov*

Please take a moment to look at this new version of VA’s main website.

- What are your impressions of this site?
  - This is everything you can go from the homepage? Looks good to me.
  - *anything stand out to you?* Maybe view your lab test results. It looks easy to get to. *Is that something you've done on a VA website?* Yeah, it does look like its designed nice and friendly.
  - Its got basically everything you're looking for. 
  - Usually I go online to look up benefits for spouses and stuff like that. It does look like it will be more friendly
- What do you think of the layout of this page?
  - *If they don’t mention it, ask about the Veteran images*
    - Some people look like they are officially in service and some look like they are spouses. 
    - Being a veteran I like seeing them
  - *If they don’t scroll down, prompt them to scroll down and give feedback*



## Task 6 Veterans Crisis Line Modal

- What do would you do if you were in crisis and looking for help on this website?
  - Immediately saw red banner
  - *If they don't see if, point to the banner*
- *Prompt to read through the banner*
  - What do you think this means?
  - What do you think you can do here?
    - It would take me to where I can possible talk to someone. 
  - What were you expecting to see?
    - Its nice that it states right away that its complimentary. Cites laws that might impact it. Being that I'm an Iraq war vet there are some days that these guys might need somebody to talk with.
    - This is actually pretty easy. Its all touch you can text, start a confidential chat or even call
  - Do you find this information useful?
    - Yeah



## Task 2 Health Care Activity - 5 min

*Start from preview.va.gov homepage*

- *What do they say about the content pages or tool landing pages?*
- *What are the difficulties when trying to login? How far do they get?*



Ask:

## (Optional) Task 3 Health Care Hub - 5 min

*Navigate user to the Health Care Hub* *https://preview.va.gov/health-care/*

- What do you think about the information on this page?
  - *Browsing menu. Imagine you aren't enrolled in healthcare, where would you find it?* Eventually finds eligibility from menu. 
  - I like how secure messaging is out in the open. I usually use the kiosk of this. I like that you can go on and do it. 
  - Veterans choice
  - Its kind of got everything thats self explanatory about the benefits. 
- Do you think this would be useful to you?
  - yeah. 
- Did you notice the contact numbers [DESKTOP: on the right side of the page] or [MOBILE: under the connect with us menu at the bottom of the page]? What do you think about this information?
  - To get care? *If you wanted to call the VA about your coverage, where would you to to find out how to call the VA?* Maybe go to contact us. *now where would you go next?* Health benefits hotline



## Post-study - 2 min

Thanks for taking a look at the new site. We have two follow up questions.

- How did that compare to your past experiences with VA websites?
  - It looks pretty good to me. It seems like it was pretty self explanatory. It was getting a pretty good idea of where things are. I didn't have to dig and look for stuff. 
- If this website went live tomorrow, what would you want other Veterans to know?
  - Maybe that there were changes right away, that should be self explanatory. Tell them to get out and have them look at it and see how everything operates. I don't know is there a video like a youtube video? Yeah that might come In handy.



## Thank you

We appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works for Veterans!
