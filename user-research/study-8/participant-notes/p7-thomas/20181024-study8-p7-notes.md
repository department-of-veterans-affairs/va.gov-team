## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the new design for VA's main website, va.gov. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a working prototype.** Some of the links or features may not be availble yet.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start recording.*



## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 3 minutes

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Have you visited any VA webistes in the past? 
  - Of course. The VA.gov, the eBenefits. MHV. I think there's a couple more I just don't know them all. 
- What was your reason for visiting? 
  - The last time I was on there on eBenefits I logged on to the VON app to submit a ... application. Prior to that on MHV I was looking up some lab results. Ask more questions if you need to dig a bit more.
- Do you have your account information for MyHealtheVet, DS Logon, or ID.me? 
  - I have them all stored, do I have to log in somewhere?




## Zero Task: Homepage - 7 Minutes

- This is the new homepage for va.gov, what are your first impressions?  
  - It looks simple, it looks clean. I wish I saw a view of the other one or at least remembered what the old one looked like. But it looks simple, it looks easy. Those are like the top 10 tabs of what people look for [pointing to zone 1].
- So you mentioned you saw where you would log in?
  - yeah. I can do this one... I can do this one so let's see if this works. I just updated my ID.me so let's see if this works. [clicks ID.me] I just replaced it. One second. [types in information, 2FA]. Sorry I haven't gotten this far. Alright it sent me a thing here. Why do I have to download the app? Can you see my screen? *Moderator informs use that he does not have to download the app, that he can choose another option. User closes login window and logs in, choosing a different option. Starts login process again.* Umm, no I'm just going to bypass that for now. 
  - Alright it looks like I'm in now, I"m logged in.
- If you wanted to see a dashboard of your information, where would you go?
  - My health? [clicks it]. So this is a familiar screen. Do you want me to stay there? *Lets go ahead and close this out.*



## MyHealtheVet

### First Task: Check your appointment - 5 minutes

You are getting ready to visit your local VA Medical Center, but first you want to check that your appointment has not been cancelled. Where would you go to do this? 

- Schedule and view your appointments in the healthcare tab [clicks in zone 1 box]. Always got to verify. Do I have to do all that right now? Do you guys want to know about my credit history? 



lets try a slightly different method since your ID.me account isn't verified. Do you have a MHV premium account?

- Yes I do. 



Where would you go if you wanted to log out of your account?

- [Clicks on Thomas] 



Ok and now this time let's log in with your MHV account

- [User gets an error on first attempt] DO you see that? *yes I do. Are you sure that's the right information?* Yes
- [logs in again] Should I sign back out? *no, let's try that again/re-reads prompt.* Ok. [scrolls through page again.] So I'm just going through the tabs again and looking for something that says... So this says schedule but I don't see anything that says schedule. Oh I'll click here... let me check my phone to make sure I have that in here.



### Second Task: Message Doctor - 5 minutes

During your appointment, your doctor said if you have questions, you can go online to send them a message. How would you do this on the site?

- Use secure messaging right here [clicks on it from the left nav] ok so you're re-routed again? [clicks on blue MHV button]. Ok just from here compose a message. Do you want me to do it?



### Third Task: Check Vitals Data - 5 minutes

A few days after your appointment, you want to go back and see what your blood pressure was at your last appointment, where would you go to see this information?

- [clicks on view labs and test results] the same tab, view lab and test results, get re-directed again. And those are my last ones. ok. Perfect, yep. 



### Fourth Task: User clicks on My VA tab on their own

- Everything is laid out here, just not in blocks and not at the top. 

So lets say from here you want to begin the process for a Voc Rehab application. 

- If I was on the other screen I'd know exactly where to know. Maybe if I go somewhere on here I'd know exactly where to go. Maybe it could be one of these or these. 
- So I just follow these steps right here, once I click education and training from this top tab [from mega menu] and these are the different programs they have as well. 

Is the left nav helpful

- I wish you had shown me a picture of the other interface because thats what I'm used to

Why don't you go ahead and follow the process that you would for the Voc Rehab. So where would you go from here?

- [clicks on Get Benefits] It usually opens up the VONApp and it opens another program and you fill it out and it takes 2 steps. Ok, so now I'm going to eBenefits. So this is a screen I'm more used to. [begins logging into eBenefits with DS logon] alright education and training, Voc rehab. Alright and it shows that I'm approved. 



## Follow-up as needed.

- What other VA services would you like to explore? 
  - I'm just looking at the tabs really quick because there may be. I want to try this one [records, dd214] because I've never seen it before. So this is like the hub for all the other ones? *what do you think about that?* I'm just so used to going to all the different ones. I have all of them cached. It will take a little bit of time to get used to, but people who are new to the system and this is what they are first what they are introduced with this is much easier and they can log into all those external websites, but I've been out since 2012 and I have all those different logins. 
  - Oh I said I was going to look at my dd214 right? It would be nice if it just logged me all the way through [from va.gov to ebenefits, like it does from VA.gov to MHV].  I'm assuming we're looking for personnel file, I thought it would take me right to there, but alright. [takes him to milConnect] Do I need to log in to this one too?
- Where would you go on the site if you were in crisis?  
- Where would you go on the site if you were at risk of becoming homeless?
  - I'd start with health care. Or I'd start with outreach. If I'm trying to help someone?  *If you yourself are at risk actually.* I'd hit that big red button up there. 
  - *In your own words what is this trying to convey?* Its there to help, I like that its not too big, its not staring at you. If I'm struggling, if I'm almost homeless I'm not going to have a computer it's going to be sold. 
- Do you see contact us? What would you expect to find under there?
  - Usually there is a giant pop-down with 20 different things. Looks like this would find the nearest VA and this is a phone number to narrow down who to speak to. I can click it. [Goes to facility locator] Oh this is nice, broken down. [Selects vet center] Lets see how many we have in the Colorado Springs area. [puts in zip code] There are so many different options out there its hard to get it all in one place. They could be looking for all the things that VA doesn't offer. 
- What do you think of the faces on the homepage? 
- Did you notice the links on the left side of the page (Left nav in hubs)? Woudl that be useful to you?



## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- How did that compare to your past experiences with VA websites?
  - Its a little bit difficult, well I wouldn't say difficult, I wouldn't even say irritating, maybe a little annoying only because I'm used to the other ones, but like I said for someone who is new to the VA its going to be cake for them.
- If this website went live tomorrow, what would you want other Veterans to know
  - Well id like to tell them that its the go to place. Any questions that they have this is the go to site this is the place that they go to if you have questions like that. There are a few of my buddies that we talk about ebenefits, but other than that its not really like a topic. 
- Do you have any questions for me? 
  - I think I'm good, I hope I answered all of your questions and I was able to give you enough information that was helpful.
