## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the new design for VA's main website, va.gov. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a working prototype.** Some of the links or features may not be available yet.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start recording.*



## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 3 minutes

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Have you visited any VA websites in the past? What was your reason for visiting? 
  - Yes. eBenefits and I forget the name of the other one offhand. 
  - Yes. Look up information for benefits. Look up my disability letter and sometimes research on appointments and results from those appointments and medications. 
  - *So the other site that you used was a health site for your information.* say that again. I said it looks like you used a health site for your appointments and information.* oh, MHV, MHV. 
- Do you have your account information for MyHealtheVet, DS Logon, or ID.me? 
  - I think so. Do I need to log in? Yeah we may try to do that during this session.* ok. 




## Zero Task: Homepage - 7 Minutes

- This is the new homepage for va.gov, what are your first impressions?  
  - So this is what you'll see. You're viewing the page. its pretty simple and straight forward. 
- What do you think about the way that its laid out?
  - I think its fine. So using myself as an example, I don't typically, well, prescriptions, I see that thats easy, disability, check your claim/appeal, thats very important. Ok, thats very important and then records. Download your benefit letters. Thats one i'm often looking for. ok, it looks good. 
- ok, ok. is there anything that you don't like about it?
  - no. 

## Zero Task: Login

- How would you log in to your account?
  - normally i'd look up to the top right where it says sign in. 
  - ok, so this is va.gov. oh, different options, alright so let's see. i'm looking up my log in. [user looks up MHV login off screen and begins login process]. Ohh so I don't know which email address is connected to that, so let's see. [after inputting MHV login, taken to screen to connect MHV to ID.me. thinks this screen is asking which email is connected to MHV account, not to connect to ID.me, confused by this step.
- what do you think this screen is trying to do?
  - it's trying to allow me to log in but its verifying via my email. [navigates to privacy policy] 
- [on privacy policy screen] if you could tell me what you think as you're looking through this page.
  - so i'm reading through the vets.gov privacy policy to see what they're stating what is the privacy policy associated with this site and it's important it says [reads from page] we will not require you to register or provide personal information in order to visit vets.gov, but it may require personal information to be granted access to certain areas. so ok. [scrolls through page] ok. ok. 
- *what do you think about that policy?
  - i'm somewhat familiar with the privacy act so i'm fine with the privacy. ok, so it's going to track certain things and it wants to use cookies. so thats really good they give you a lot of information about what you're doing so it eliminates questions and concerns so alright so [goes back to account verification screen, enters email, begins verification process] alright let me read this. [walks through verifications steps] thats pretty involved. 
- yeah, what do you think about that process you just went through?
  - i thought it was pretty cool, but thats my perspective because i tend to read everything.
