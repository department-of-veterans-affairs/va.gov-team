### Have you visited any VA websites in the past?

Yes, a few times for various reasons. Mostly for educational benefits.

### Which?

Whichever one is the standard one. [Goes into his email] I think I’ve used eBenefits. I have looked at MHV but I haven’t really used it because my clinic is nearby and my doctor is so user friendly that I haven’t really needed it. I am aware of the ID.me.

### Do you know if you have an ID.me account?

I believe that I registered one but I haven’t gotten on the website and used it for anything.

### Do you have any accts like MHV, DS Logon, other than ID.me?

No.

[Melissa sends him Preview link in chat and asks him to open website. Participant needed some help to get Preview open.]

### Look at this page and tell me your first impressions.

It looks  fairly straightforward [reads aloud some of the benefits]. Refill and track prescriptions, that’s good. I literally just put 3 RX orders in today. BTW, it’s so easy… it’s one of the reasons I haven’t used the online refill before because they send me the pills and they give me all the sheets to renew them. I see the doctor once a year and as long as the blood work is OK…. Sorry I am getting off on an aside… 

[continues to read and list benefits aloud]. I have a son that is using the GI bill. That’s working. Both of my boys are enrolled. The one son’s benefits have stopped so I… 

I’m good with the disability category and need to look into the records. Looks straight forward to me.

[Scrolls down]

I like that it’s a cross section of people. [Talked about diversity of people in photos but I missed exactly what he said]. It’s got a dog that is getting hugged and loved. It’s got a nice gender mix. An older guy but a lot of young people. 

[Reads aloud the list of benefits below the hero area]

Yeah, it looks good. You’ve got all kinds of stuff at the bottom [lists items].

Yeah, it looks pretty user friendly. 

[Lists social media platforms] Yeah, you’ve got all of them. Looks modern. No criticism yet.

The crisis line is down at the very, very bottom. That might be something that gets a teeny bit more…

### Where do you see that?

It’s in the lower bottom right hand side. [points to it with mouse]

### Did you notice it elsewhere?

Actually I see a red flag that I have the mouse on up at the top, but I didn’t see it at first. Maybe that wants to be slightly larger up there. And now I see it in the middle under Burials and Memorials. Maybe you want something that side up at the top.

### Will you click that (crisis line prompt)? Take a look at the info there and tell me what you think.

I like it. I can call or text. I see a confidential chat line. You’ve got hearing impaired. It looks pretty easy to do it, but it starts “we’re here any time day or night.” I would put something that if you need to talk to another veteran, we’ll get one on the line.

I worked at the Wounded Warrior Regiment for the Marine Corps for two years, but not everyone in the call center was a veteran, but we had at least one or more if someone asked to directly speak to a veteran. Occasionally people won’t talk to anyone else. Obviously not a… it’s the quality. You can have a veteran that doesn’t click with the person calling, but I know there are people that don’t want to talk to anyone but a veteran. Someone who understands them.

### You said you don’t have a DS logon or MHV account?

I believe I do but I haven’t used it in a long time.

Are you able to see in the system?

### I can not. You said you have an ID.me account. Do you think you can login, or would you try to do some things without logging in?

[Participant prefers not to login.]

### You mentioned you had some children that are taking advantage of the GI Bill. Do you want to take a look through education and poke around to see how we could figure out how you would determine how much money you have left?

I know approximately where I am. I transferred all to one son, who will use the entire… who will complete his final two years of school. He goes to a private school that has a matching yellow ribbon program, so we’re very lucky that way. I get a small amount through my disability per month, and that is what I was referring to. One of those… I need to renew with transcripts to prove my son is still in school.

Where would you go to do that?

I think it would be under Disability > Payment history. It tells me to sign in, so I’d have to restore a password. Do we have to do that?

### No, we don’t have to.

I would check the compensation and I would see that the amount has gone down some months ago and I’m assuming… it was $100 a month and I’m assuming that it has timed out. If it isn’t renewed it just stops. That’s just a guess.

### Based on what you see on this page, do you think you landed in the right place?

Yeah what I did last time was call the help line and get an education person on the line. I think the person was in Texas at the time? And she walked me through the steps after she confirmed my identification through SSN and I was surprised that I got someone fairly quickly who assisted me through instead off multiple voicemail types without getting anything. 

That’s my first step [to call] and if that didn’t work… certainly a first time user getting into the VA system, this information is good here. This is good if this is a change. This is user friendly and this is where they want you to go to eBenefits, but that’s my shortcut to get help.

### What about the info between the blue box and the number… is that helpful?

[Sorry, I’m not sure exactly what page we were on here. Refer to recording.]

Yeah, I think this would show why I am getting why I am getting and what and how it changed. That’s probably the one stop for the eBenefits.

### If you read that before you saw the blue box, is that more or less helpful?

Probably, but you have it right here in large print “View Your VA Payment History” so you’ve steered me. Am I impatient? Am I going too fast? But this tells me up front what you’re getting and why.

### Let’s go back to the homepage.

[user clicks logo]

### Imagine that you want to get a VIC. Where would you go?

Right here under Records. First thing. Very easy to find. I have one somewhere. I tucked it away. I don’t carry it on me. My retiree ID card is usually sufficient and they punch in my SSN and I am in every time. I haven’t really needed it. But it’s very easy to find right here.

### Let’s take a look at that.

So there’s my DoD ID… um, I have a health ID card, you know I have used the VA Choice program, or I have been referred out for dental work in the community but I haven’t had to produce any kind of ID at the dentist. They fill out the paperwork and they send it to someone who fills it out and sends it to my main hospital. There are apparently enough people in the community that this process is user friendly.

This one… again, my retiree ID card is sufficient so. I haven’t had to apply for a VIC, which I think you have to pay for.

[Clicks around] Am I eligible? I guess I could do this. My DoD one has been more than satisfactory, and I have a state ID card as a secondary form of photo ID.

### Does your state license have your veteran status?

No, and I think they charge you for that. I do have a veteran license plate.

### If you scroll up and on the left side under “Records” it says “types of veteran ID cards”… did you notice that?

I didn’t when we first started talking but we were on this page earlier and I was speaking before I scrolled down and read. I have a health ID card which I have never used. They asked me a couple times when I went to the hospital but then I showed my retiree ID and then they said ok, don’t worry about it so I stopped bringing it.

I have heard of the Choice program but it doesn’t do anything for me. If I wasn’t retired, maybe this would be more useful to me as a veteran.

### I have some questions about the navigation on the left side. Is it helpful to have the button to click back to this page?

It was pretty easy.

The website is very user friendly. It’s very black and white with a little bit of blue for your links. Maybe that’s the way you want to do it. The questions are basic. No, it’s very user friendly. I don’t know what would catch my attention better, but you’re using blue, black, the little background color [moused over a collapsed accordion], and bold for your links. It’s good, but I’m trying to think of something more eye catching but it’s fairly straightforward and I found it.

### Let’s explore another benefit area. Pick any benefit area that you find interesting or want to take a look at.

I am interested in learning another skill. I’m a teacher, and I’d like to learn how to do massage therapy. I am wondering if there are vocational benefits for me to learn an additional skill. 

[Goes to Voc Rehab page]

I am considered 100% disabled for a variety of things so I am wondering if I am eligible to return to school outside of my GI Bill benefits, which I have turned over to my youngest son. Am I taking you away from your questions?

[Clicks around and goes to VR&E disability]

I don’t know if this statement explains me. It says “limits my ability to work.” I’m working. I’m a teacher, so I can work, I’m obviously working.

[reads through text]

So these are all me… 12 years from [something]. I’m well within that. That’s clear. 

[Continues to read through text]

That’s what I am looking for… secondary training. And that’s the next thing I think, is to speak to a veteran services counselor that works at the local junior college who runs the program. 

[Clicks another link] Let me see if this helps me.

Maybe “start your own business/self employment”. I’ll take a look at that.

OK, so I’d have to be enrolled in VR&E. And I see it’s telling me what to do. It’s steering me back to the eBenefits site, which is fairly clear.

I brought up a question and I was able to research it from the website and it was fairly clear and it explained it to me, but ultimately, I have to go here and I probably have to talk to someone who… I would do a little more research on the eBenefits site. Pretty good. Pretty helpful.

### You mentioned on the first page that the information didn’t apply to you because you can work. What would make it more appealing to you?

Maybe the line I find under the self employment track… perhaps outside of driving and desire to run a business, if you’re a veteran or service member with a service-connected disability who has a desire to contribute to society… if you want to better yourself and you want to find alternate means of getting out into the workforce, this is for you. Maybe you don’t want to run a business, you just want to return to the workforce in a way that fits you.

When we had men and women at Wounded Warrior Regiment, we had classes and we didn’t want them to sit on the porch and self medicate. We wanted to find ways for them to get out in society to do something productive. Maybe modify the line under “self employment track.”

[On careers and employment page]

This is good [as he reads more items]. Have I been here or did I not open it?

### You haven’t been here.

Maybe that is what I am looking for. I want to use the Voc Rehab piece because my GI bill is committed.

### How did this site compare to your past experience using VA websites?

It’s straightforward and easy to navigate. If I didn’t open things in the right order it’s on me, not the website. The information is there. It might need more color cueing somehwere, and perhaps that is familiar and comforting in its own way. But when I look at everything it is fairly easy to navigate. You didn’t have to prompt me much.

### If this website, went live tomorrow, what would you want other vets to know?

It’s never been easier to get online and find out what the VA van do for you. That would be my catch line. It’s never been easier. We’ve completely updated and modernized our website. See how easy it is.

### Any questions for me?

Are you a designer?

[Melissa answers]

(makes small talk) Yeah, it’s pretty user friendly.

[Melissa answers]

Great, well what is the approx. launch time?

[A couple weeks out.]

That’s soon!

[Melissa continues to answer]

Wow, ok. I am thankful for the work you are doing. I am very pleased – comforted — by all the assistance I have had from the VA> Nothing but good things to say. I’ve had great care out in [town].

I’m glad you’re doing what you’re doing. Idk what I am going to do when I grow up. I retired after 35 years and I’m teaching at Camp [name].

I hope I have been some help to you.
