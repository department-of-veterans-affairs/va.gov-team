## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the new design for VA's main website, va.gov. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a working prototype.** Some of the links or features may not be availble yet.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start recording.*

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 3 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Have you visited any VA webistes in the past? What was your reason for visiting?
> Yes – ebenefits, myhealthevet, and another one I cant’ think of at the moment. I only have access to myhealthevet right now.
- Do you have your account information for MyHealtheVet, DS Logon, or ID.me?
> For ebenefits, tracking my va claim status; for putting in paperwork; [couldn’t hear] usually for checking up on upcoming appointments,because sometimes it's hard to get to my provider by phone; secure messaging, refills if they're about to expire.  
## Zero Task: Homepage - 7 Minutes
- This is the new homepage for va.gov, what are your first impressions?
>	I like that it’s simplified, everything's right there if you need healthcare, disability. Instead of having to navigate and 12 pages later you find what you need. Good layout. Not too cluttered, very simple. Can focus on what youre looking for and not get easily distracted. 
**Asked about images**
> I like those – shows the diversity of what vets are nowadays.

**Asked anything you don’t like about this page?**
> No I think it’s pretty good. 

## MyHealtheVet
## First Task: Check your appointment - 5 minutes

You are getting ready to visit your local VA Medical Center, but first you want to check that your appointment has not been cancelled. Where would you go to do this? 
>	Schedule and View your appointments under health care. I like you can get support – how do I talk to someone right now. 
**Scrolls**
> Do you want me to sign in? **she clicks sign in; signs in – couple steps**
> I like it’s actually going fairly quick. Usually when you have to connect your account, takes forever. 

**completes sign in and scrolls**
>It’s kind of weird I get this page after I log in. I like that it shows I’m logged in, but not everyone will catch that – not enough of a change. Would be better if  I didn’t have to click to open another tab. Better if it automatically opened in another tab. On viewing appointments, it pulls up appointments from 2016 first. I’d have to go through 2 years of appointments to get to my curent appointments. 

**Asked is this location where you would check canceled appointments?**
> Yes.

## Second Task: Message Doctor - 5 minutes

During your appointment, your doctor said if you have questions, you can go online to send them a message. How would you do this on the site?
> Is it under Get Care…no. Probably go to Home and then, compose message. I like that this automatically pulls up secure messaging. Before it just didn’t make sense. I like that format has changed. You can select where it’s [message] going to go to and not restricted to the subject that it can be, like before. I like this layout better. 

## Third Task: Check Vitals Data - 5 minutes

A few days after your appointment, you want to go back and see what your blood pressure was at your last appointment, where would you go to see this information?
> Wouldn’t be under lab and test results… would it? Let’s try that. 

**Clicks, lands on View your lab results page; scrolls**
> I like that it keeps you logged in, so you don’t have to go back in. It’s not in health history. Actually don’t know. Oh, vitals. 

**Goes to vitals and readings** 
> This looks like something I would enter myself so I’m not sure…where I would look. 

**Keeps scrolling**
> Not sure where to find it from appointment. 

## DS Logon
## First Task: Check your status - 5 minutes

You want to see if there have been any updates to the disability claim you filed last month, where would you go on the site?
**goes back to homepage on prompt** 
> Would it be …records? **doesn’t scroll** I’m not sure what part of it though. 
>I’m reading the information **scrolls** personalized my VA page? Possibly? 

**clicks, scrolls new page** 
> I like that it’s easier to see becasu I haven’t been able to log in to ebenefits. I like that I can track my claim from here. I don’t know if I’d have to log in from there. Making it you only have to log in once and not 12 million times. Very frustrating. Probably the last 9 months at least, I’ve been trying to log in to ebenefits, so this is really good, I can access it. Like that I can log in to one website and then do all this from one. I like that a lot. 

**Asked what did you expect to find here** 
> I figured healthcare, insurance, address that kind of thing. I thought it would have my military service. My home address is not (accurate). 

**she goes to edit it** 
> It works and a lot faster than before too. I’ve been using veteran websites in general for 6-7 years. 

**Anything else you want to explore** 
> no, pretty good. 

**locate more info for disability ben, where?**
>Probably Disability. I like that you can pull this up before you’re redirected somewhere. 
**Opens mega nav** 
> It's easier than before – I think might be under this – **clicks on Disability; lands on Disability Benefits page; scrollls** I like that it has examples, and also vocrehap info. I don’t think many ppl don’t know about it. Probably 5-6 yrs before I even knew VA had a vocrehab program. 

**did you see info on left?**
>Yes, you can find out a lot of info, esp with hazardous materials. I was interested in special claims. **clicks**

**Asked is info useful for you?**
> Definitley, I’m learning a lot more info than before. Before it was so hard to navigate and then you forgot how you got there. This is so streamlined, easy to see. 

**If you’re in crisis – homeless – where go?** 
> Probably crisis line. Well I don’t know what all they can help with but **clicks** could be a resource.  
**Wwhat did you think of the info** 
> I like different choices of how to contact them. Like I’m online, so I can chat. Especially with two kids, gets very loud in the background. It just says crisis and not suicide hotline or mental health hotline. It’smore inviting because vets don’t like to accept help, and then the word suicide deters a lot of ppl – oh maybe I’m not, what if I take this resource away from some one else who really needs it. Whatever youre struggline with, it encompasses everything. 

**How would you log out?** 
> Under my name and sign out. 

## Second Task:  Upload Evidence - 5 minutes

VA responded to your claim and requested that you add an additional supporting document online, where would you go to add it?
**Open claim with claim status**
> (goes to special claims page) Under my va **clicks** View my appeal. This page had upload supporting docs or one of them did. **scrolls**  Maybe under track your claims and appeals. 

**clicks and scrolls**
> Now I don’t remember where I saw it. **click to disability compensation, scrolls**

**clicks away to ebenefits, scrolls**

**Asked what is happening now?**
> so I forgotten my ds login and stuff, so when I try and go get my password...

**she tries to change password online** 
> when I put in my ssn I have problems **sees error code,  retries** I’ve not been able to get this far. **forgot what she had entered as new passwd, retries; keeps erroring out with the long psswd requirements; success! Now prompted to sign in with ds logon; signs in**

>I think it’s My Documents **clicks there, scrolls** that’s just what I’ve sent them, so it probably… **clicks open accordions, clicks to Details about your appeal page; back to Work in process**

**Prompted to close & return to hp**

## Third Task: Check payment history - 5 minutes

Your bank's webiste is not showing the amount of your last payment from VA. Where would you go to find this information?

## ID.me
## First Task: Check your status - 5 minutes

You want to see if there have been any updates to the disability claim you filed last month, where would you go on the site?

## Second Task:  GI Bill - 5 minutes

You are thinking about going back to college and want to know if you have any money left on your GI Bill, where would you go to check?

## Third Task: Veteran ID - 5 minutes

You want to get an ID that proves you are a Veteran, where would you go to get it?

## Follow-up as needed.
- What other VA services would you like to explore?
- Where would you go on the site if you were in crisis?
- What do you think of the faces on the homepage?
- Did you notice the links on the left side of the page (Left nav in hubs)? Woudl that be useful to you?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- How did that compare to your past experiences with VA websites?
> Lot less frustrating. For the most part, where I thought had the info, had it. Instead of before, 12 pages later.  

- If this website went live tomorrow, what would you want other Veterans to know?
> That it’s the same website but better and easier. 

- Do you have any questions for me?
