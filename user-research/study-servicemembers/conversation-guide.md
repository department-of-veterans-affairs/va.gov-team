## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about Service member benefits offered by VA and the VA's website. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start recording.*


## First Task: Benefits Questions - 10 minutes

- Have you ever used any VA benefits or services?
  - Tell me about the last time you interacted with VA.
  - What was the most difficult part of that experience?

- Are there any times in your life where you are planning to interact with VA in the future?
  - Are you planning to retire or separate from service in the next year?

- How would you get information about VA benefits and services?

- Have you ever visited a VA website?
  - What were you trying to do?
  - Tell me about that experience.
  - Did you create an account?

- What would expect to find on va.gov?

### Things to watch for:

- How does the participant get information today?
- What types of benefits and services are they aware of / unaware of?
- Where would they expect to find this infromation?
- How should we organize the information so they can understand it?

## Second Task: Card Sort - 20 minutes

For the next activity, I am going to ask you to share your screen. Can you see the chat window or icon? I am sending you a link, please click on it.

*Send link: https://adhoc.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/61kwyt8k*

Please click continue, on the next screen type in the number [participant number] into the box and select continue again. Thank you.

Ok, during this activity you are going to click on the cards on the left side of the screen and drag them over to right. On the right side, you can put them into groups that make sense to you. Afterward, you will get to label those groups however you want. During this activity, it really helps if you can think-out-loud, so I can follow along. Please feel free to describe what you are doing or tell me which card you are reading. Does that sound good?

*Allow participant to work on card sort, prompting them to follow think-aloud protocol.*
*Prompt them to create a "not applicable" pile if dont understand or care about a card*
*Do not let them hit submit until after questions*

### Folllow-up Questions:
- Which of these cards are the most important to you?
- Any that you were not aware of before today?
- Which of these would you see yourself using in the future?

### Things to watch for:

- What is the logic behind the groupings?
- Are they decisive or indecisive?
- How confident are they in the group labels?
- Are some cards more important that others?

*****Submit the card sort*****

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Do you have any additional questions for me?

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

As a thank you for your participation, we'd like to offer you a $50 thank-you gift. 
Great, is it ok for Perigean to send that gift to the same address we used to communicate with you about scheduling this test? 
[If no] Ok, we'll follow up with an email after this session to get the right email from you in writing.

Thanks! Lastly, would you like to share this feedback opportunity with other Veterans or Veteran groups you're a part of? If so, I can send you an email with a little blurb so you can easily connect folks to our team.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
