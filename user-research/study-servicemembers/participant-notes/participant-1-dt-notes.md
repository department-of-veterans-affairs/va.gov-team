## First Task: Benefits Questions - 10 minutes

- **Have you ever used any VA benefits or services? <br>**
I’m using the education benefits right now. Right now, I’m using my Montgomery GI Bill because I’m still active duty. So using I think the Chapter 30 Bill. I just called and I talked maybe 5 minutes on the phone and got everything set up and the school pretty much did the rest.<br>
  - **You said that it was pretty simple?**<br>
Mmm-hmm.
  - **Tell me about the last time you interacted with VA.** <br>
  I interacted with them then, and then I recently interacted with them because I’m due to get out within 70 days, I think, so we’re in the process of changing my Montgomery GI Bill over to Post-9/11. At the end of the term, it will be switched over then. That was easy, they just set it up…<br>
  And then I’m also in the process of scheduling my disability physical with them, and that’s a little harder to get in for because that’s the medical side of things.<br>
    - **What do you mean by that?** <br>
  So, I guess whether it’s the VA side or the active duty medical side, it just takes forever to get in.<br>
    - **To be seen, do you mean?**<br>
  Yes, I called in December and I won’t be seen until the end of March, so that’s 3 months. And my separation is in the middle of April, so that gives me like a 2-week window.<br>
    - **Yeah, that’s a little tight, isn’t it?**<br>
  Mmm-hmm.  
- **Are there any times in your life where you are planning to interact with VA in the future?** <br>
In the future, I would like to use my benefits for buying a house, the VA loan. I would like to use that in the future because I hear that’s great. I don’t know too much about it…<br>
  - **So for that benefit, for instance, where would you go to learn more about it?**<br>
  For that benefit, you can get onto the VA website, which is a great resource. I know you can get on there, there’s a calculator and you can put in and it will give you an idea of what you might be approved for…You can get on any military bank website and you can use their calculator as well. You can even call their representatives and they’ll tell you about the options and you can also call the VA as well. <br>
  - **What were you trying to do when you arrived there on the VA website?** <br>
  So I have used that calculator just to see what I could possibly be approved for in this area, in Maryland, because it’s going to be expensive. Also just to learn about the different factors about buying a house because I am very young, and I don’t know much about the process…
  - **Did you find what you were looking for on the site?** <br>
  I did. I actually really like the VA website a lot. 
  - **When  were you visiting the site to gather that information?** <br>
  I probably used the website to do the housing stuff probably 6 months ago…But I use that website probably on a weekly basis for just other things in general, for school stuff, house stuff, VA disability stuff. You name it, I’ve used the website for it. 
  - **Is there any other information that you would expect to find on VA.gov?**
  Umm, I don’t think there’s anything that I would expect to find that I couldn’t already…I think for me, it’s a one-stop-shop. If I need something, it’s going to be there.
- **Anything else to add about your experiences seeking VA benefits?** <br>
I think that the process for seeking VA disability is a little convoluted. It’s not very straightforward. You kind of have to—it’s very muddled, you kind of have to fit all the puzzle pieces together before you even know what you’re doing, before you can go forward. I think it would be best if there were some clarified steps moving forward so other service members knew what to do so they could better serve themselves.

## Second Task: Card Sort - 20 minutes

***[moves TAP card into its own category]*** Okay, so, I’m going to put TAP here because I’m going to make this kind of like an overall category, what they really focus on and hit home on. And then the other category is going to be things that they don’t really cover or consider.

***[moves Health Care under TAP]*** So health care after separation is a really big item because it’s something that we lose and the military only covers us 6 months after we get out.

***[moves Home Loan to its own category]*** So this is going to go into a category of its own because this is a benefit we get to carry until we use it.

***[moves Records to its own category]*** I don't really know what to do with this.

***[moves GI Bill/Education Benefits over with Home Loan]*** GI Bill and other education benefits is going to go with home loans because it’s something we get to keep until we use it fully.

***[moves Disability under TAP]*** Disability is something that’s another big ticket item because they hit on it, but we don’t really know how to do it. There aren’t really guidelines around how to fill it out. And we also don’t know what to do if we get denied for it.

***[moves Burials into its own category]*** Burials—this is something they talk to us about, but we don’t need it when we go to TAP because, obviously, we’re alive when we go there…but we don’t know how to convey it to our families and most of our families don’t know about it.

***[moves Careers and Employment under TAP]*** Careers and Employment—they do a really good job of explaining this and have people come talk to us about job opportunities.

***[moves Life Insurance to the category with Burials]*** Life insurance—this is something else we hear about during TAP, but I’m going to put it with Burials because the options they give us don’t help us. Most of us don’t qualify for the options now, and then the other options are too expensive…they’re unreasonable once we’re out of the military. They shouldn’t even talk about it.

***[moves Voc Rehab to the category with Burials and Life Insurance]*** Vocational rehab—I’m not even sure what that is. Clearly that one didn’t stick of that was talked about.

***[moves Veterans Pension to the TAP category]*** Veterans pension benefits—that one was talked about during TAP, and I think it’s a great resource if you are a Veteran and I think that one is specifically for Veterans if they reach their pension.

***[moves Records to category with Home Loan and GI Bill]*** Records—what terms of records? Like our records? The records of us being in the military? Like you’ll always have a record of you being in the military.

***[labels categories as follows]***
- TAPS
  - Health Care
  - Disability
  - Pension
  - Careers and Employment
- Not TAPS
  - Burials
  - Life Insurance
  - Voc Rehab
- Lifetime Benefits
  - Home Loan
  - GI Bill/education
  - Records
  
### Follow-up Questions:
- **Which of these cards are the most important to you?** <br>
Healthcare after separation or retirement. <br>
- **Any others?** <br>
Life insurance. And *[pause]* careers and employment assistance. And I think those would be my 3.
- **Any that you were not aware of before today?** <br>
Probably now that I think about it, I think I know what was meant by vocational rehabilitation and employment benefits. But I’m still not sure what you meant by records. <br>
  - **So records and maybe voc rehab?** <br>
  Yeah.
- **Which of these would you see yourself using in the future?** <br>
The certificate of eligibility for the home loans. Possibly the burial in a VA national cemetery. I’ll use the pre-discharge disability claim. I did use the transition assistance program. And I think that’s it. I might use the records, depending on what that is.

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- **Do you have any additional questions for me?** <br>
Do you know what the records are? <br>
  - **Yes, I do. So you were correct about that. It includes your VA records, DD214, and other military records.** <br>
Well, then, yes, I’ll definitely use that one.

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes
