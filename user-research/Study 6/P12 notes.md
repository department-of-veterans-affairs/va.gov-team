- If this website went live tomorrow, what would you want other Veterans to know?
"i went thorugh, most of these things because im fully retired, and i had to go through VA for medical and medical benefits. i like having all these things in front of me because ive had to do them all, like the Veteran ID, the only way to do it before was in person, you couldnt get your medical records easily before, you can get your home loadn

"i would rename COE (didnt know what it was), apply for VA home loan mortgage, put VA in there."

"this is excellent, where am i going to get my DD-214 from, its never been clear"
"Vet ID is not the most importatn on the records list, i would put download letter, request records, get Va medical redords, aply for COE, then apply for Vet ID."  "I have a Vet ID card, ive never used it, they have it on my license"

"disability i would have learn how to file a claim #1" thats what most people witll look for

"assuming most Veterans do not have any contact with VA"

HC - no changes
Edu - its spot on

- Do you have any questions for me?
