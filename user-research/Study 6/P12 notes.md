## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 3 minutes

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Have you visited any VA webistes in the past? What was your reason for visiting?

"Yes to access my VA account and look for information. Went through ebenefits, research the educational benefits and I was trying to upload some medical records on the medical side, I found it tedious to do."


## Zero Task: Homepage - 7 Minutes
- This is the new homepage for va.gov, what are your first impressions?

"I like it already." 

- What  kind of message do you think this new site sends to Veterans?

"Clean and clear, as a veteran I have very specific questions, whether its HC, Disability, Education, or Records. I like it, I don't have to go digging anywhere."

"In the past I was always confused with the whole VHA, VBA, and NCA."

- What do you think you can do on this page?

"I can access my records in these 4 areas, quickly. Download your benefits letter, I have to do that fairly often."

"HC haven't used it that often."

"It's easy, it's like one stop shopping. I don't have to drill down into those menus on the previous website that can be confusing."

"Items you need like upload evidence, that was difficult in the past, its right there in front of you now."

"Its right there in front of you it just pops right up."

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- How did that compare to your past experiences with VA websites?

"this is much easier"

"on this screen im not signed in right. im just getting the 50,00ft information unless i sign in. if i signed in right now, would i go back to this page"

found sign-in up top, 

"if i sign in and it goes to another page, i lose the benefit of this page. if you're just looking for the standard info this is great. if i was looking at the lab and health care"

"maybe this sign in up to could go away"

- If this website went live tomorrow, what would you want other Veterans to know?

"I went through, most of these things because I'm fully retired, and I had to go through VA for medical and medical benefits. I like having all these things in front of me because I've had to do them all, like the Veteran ID, the only way to do it before was in person, you couldn't get your medical records easily before, you can get your home loan..."

"i would rename COE (didnt know what it was), apply for VA home loan mortgage, put VA in there."

"This is excellent, where am I going to get my DD-214 from, it's never been clear"

"Vet ID is not the most important on the records list, I would put download letter, request records, get VA medical records, apply for COE, then apply for Vet ID."  "I have a Vet ID card, I've never used it, they have it on my license"

"disability I would have learn how to file a claim #1" thats what most people witll look for

"assuming most Veterans do not have any contact with VA"

HC - no changes
Edu - its spot on

- Do you have any questions for me?
