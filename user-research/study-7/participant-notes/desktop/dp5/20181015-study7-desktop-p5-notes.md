## Warm-up - 3 min

Before we look at the new website, could you please tell us:

- What are some reasons you would visit a VA website today?
 - Usually use MHV. Use it to look up "a particular thing" onthe web site.
- Would you typically use your phone or a computer?
 - Typically uses phone because his computer doesn't work. Takes 45 minutes or an hour or more.



## Task 1 Homepage - 5 min

*Navigate user to* *https://preview.va.gov*

Please take a moment to look at this new version of VA’s main website.

- What are your impressions of this site?
   - Looks like it would be helpful to send secure messages to health team and refill prescriptions. "I think this would be great to be able to do this [send a secure message]"
   - Used to be a Veterans Service Officer, so things like claim for increase are really helpful.
   - Doesn't know how to do many things online now. Veterans Service Officers today aren't very helpful. They're not VA employees and don't really know the system.
 - *If they don’t scroll down, prompt them to scroll down and give feedback*
    - Scrolling some more.
 - *If they don’t mention it, ask about the Veteran images*
    - Think it's fantastic. Represents all kinds of different people. "Don't see anything offensive about it."
    - Veterans looking for Educational Assistance, they don't really know where to go or who to ask. (Looking at Education section in Zone 2)
    - (Burials in Zone 2): When a Veterans passes away and is on a second marriage, that spouse doesn't really know what to do. So this section could be helpful to them.
    - (Looking at news section, Story on Appeals?) This would be a big help pointing in the right direction

- What do you think of the layout of this page?



## Task 2 Health Care Activity - 5 min

*Start from preview.va.gov homepage*

- You mentioned in the beginning that you would go online to [refill your prescriptions]. How would you do this on the website?

*We are interested in watching the user’s approach.*

 - Clicks a Refill Rx link in top tasks.
 - Clicks sign in on Rx Static Tools page.
 - (Sign in Modal opens)

- *What path do they use, HP link, navigation, etc?*

- *What do they say about the content pages or tool landing pages?*

- *What are the difficulties when trying to login? How far do they get?*
   - didn't have login info


Ask:

- Was that experience what you were expecting?



## Task 3 Health Care Hub - 5 min

*Navigate user to the Health Care Hub* *https://preview.va.gov/health-care/*

- What do you think about the information on this page?
- Do you think this would be useful to you?
   - (Scrolling down page)
   - If I was a new Veteran--I've been coming for 30 years, I don't have a problem getting health care I can get an appointment any time I need.
   - Secure messaging would be good.
   - Clicked on "Secure Messaging" from left nav
   - Did not know about or use Secure Messaging Before
   - I think there's enough info here that I could use it if I wanted to

- Did you notice the contact numbers [DESKTOP: on the right side of the page] or [MOBILE: under the connect with us menu at the bottom of the page]? What do you think about this information?



## Task 4 Content Page or Tool Landing Page - 5 min

*Return user to one of the content pages or tool pages they visited in Task 2 or 3*

- Please take a look at the navigation options on [DESKTOP: the left side of the screen] or [MOBILE: under the more in this section menu].  
- What do you think about the options in this menu?
- Would you use this menu to navigate the website?



## Task 5 Sign-in and Dashboard - 5 min

*Return user to the homepage -  preview.va.gov*

- Where would you go on this page to login to your account?

  - *Prompt them to sign in if they can, if not use a production account to log them in*

- What do you think you can do here?

- What were you expecting to see?

- Do you find this information useful?



## Post-study - 2 min

Thanks for taking a look at the new site. We have two follow up questions.

- *What would you do if you were in crisis?*
   - Call the Veterans Crisis Line, is that on here?
   - Goes back to the home page, given direction
   - Looking in Benefits megamenu
   - Sees send a secure message
   - Does not see the VCL banner.


- How did that compare to your past experiences with VA websites?

   - I think it would be very easy to learn quickly.

- If this website went live tomorrow, what would you want other Veterans to know?

   - Go use it!
   - **"Know a lot of Veterans who talk bad about the VA because they don't know how to hound the system."**



## Thank you
