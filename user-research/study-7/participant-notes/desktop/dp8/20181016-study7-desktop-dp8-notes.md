## Warm-up - 3 min

Before we look at the new website, could you please tell us:

- What are some reasons you would visit a VA website today?
   - Oh yah use it all the time.
   - **Dot Gov**. And then I use MHV for appointment status.
   - Also was trying to start a business and wanted to see what grants they offered.
- Would you typically use your phone or a computer?
   - Desktop



## Task 1 Homepage - 5 min

*Navigate user to* *https://preview.va.gov*

Please take a moment to look at this new version of VA’s main website.

- What are your impressions of this site?
   - Thrown off by Chrome.
- What do you think of the layout of this page?
   - Seems somewhat simple. The other one has a lot of choices and options and "tab downs"
- *If they don’t mention it, ask about the Veteran images*
- *If they don’t scroll down, prompt them to scroll down and give feedback*



## Task 6 Veterans Crisis Line Modal

- What do would you do if you were in crisis and looking for help on this website?
   - Does not see the VCL banner
   - "I would look for a link"
   - "Then I would look for something that says help or crisis."
   - User does not see anything. User clicks on Health and Benefits megamenu.
   - User scrolls down page. Past Zone 1. Past zone 2. Down to footer.
   - Finally finds VCL in footer
- *Prompt to read through the banner*
- What do you think this means?
   - If you need help at 3am and you're depressed you call this number
- Do you find this information useful?
   - **Of course. For someone that needs it, yes, yes.**



## Task 5 Sign-in and Dashboard - 5 min

    - Immediately finds sign in. Clicks button
    - "That's good. MHV is right there"
    - Clicks MHV button
    - Signs in with his own credentials.
    - (Got error in pop up modal.)
    - Enters his own credentials
    - Is presented with ID.me option to link ID.me account
    - "I think it's linking my VA account to my email account"
    - Enters his email address and clicks continue
    - Presented with 2FA Modal
     - "Oh man"
    - Enters his cell phone number (reluctantly)

- What do you think you can do here? 
- What were you expecting to see?
- Do you find this information useful?
- How would you get to your account homepage?



## Task 2 Health Care Activity - 5 min

*Start from preview.va.gov homepage*

- You mentioned in the beginning that you would go online to [look at appointments]. How would you do this on the website?

*We are interested in watching the user’s approach.*

- *What path do they use, HP link, navigation, etc?*
   - From home page, went to megamenu
   - Clicked Schedule appointment
   - Went to landing page
   - Clicked appointments, opened MHV in new tab
   - Now on MHV page, but comments that it looks different (there is an error on the MHV appointments page)
   - Scrolls down, sees his actual appointments, says that is what he expected to see.


- *What do they say about the content pages or tool landing pages?*
- *What are the difficulties when trying to login? How far do they get?*



Ask:

- Was that experience what you were expecting?



## (Optional) Task 3 Health Care Hub - 5 min

## Post-study - 2 min

Thanks for taking a look at the new site. We have two follow up questions.
