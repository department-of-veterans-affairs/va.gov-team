Please take a moment to look at this new version of VA’s main website.

- What are your impressions of this site?
 - Looking at all different links and options;
 - asks about getting ID cards, but finds it hard to believe
- What do you think of the layout of this page?
 - Wants bullets / dots along the top tasks links
 - Font is good
 - Looks clean overall.
 - All the health care top tasks seem to be the main ones
- *If they don’t mention it, ask about the Veteran images*
 - Likes mix of ethnicities, genders, ages. Feels all-inclusive.
 - Doesn't know the branch emblems.
- *If they don’t scroll down, prompt them to scroll down and give feedback*



## Task 6 Veterans Crisis Line Modal

 - Immediately scrolls to the top and sees the VCL banner
 - Thinks it means chat / type text
 - Points out that crisis isn't only suicide prevention; could also be (e.g.) getting evicted soon
 - Thinks it would be better if it were larger
 - Clicks on banner
 - Sees that there are multiple ways to get help (including chat)


## Task 5 Sign-in and Dashboard - 5 min

*Return user to the homepage -  preview.va.gov*

- Where would you go on this page to login to your account?
 - "Which account?"
 - It depends. If I want my claim, I go to eBenefits (top tasks box), if I want my healthevet I go here (points to health top tasks)
 - Found myVA in nav bar quickly
 - Dismissed welcome popup quickly
 - Scrolls through dashboard (test account)
 - "What about getting your military records" (in records section)
 

- *Prompt them to sign in if they can, if not use a production account to log them in*
- What do you think you can do here?
- What were you expecting to see?
- Do you find this information useful?
- How would you get to your account homepage?


## Task 2 Health Care Activity - 5 min
*Start from preview.va.gov homepage*

- You mentioned in the beginning that you would go online to [see calendar of appointments]. How would you do this on the website?

*We are interested in watching the user’s approach.*

- *What path do they use, HP link, navigation, etc?*
 - Clicks appointments in top tasks

- *What do they say about the content pages or tool landing pages?*
 - Thinks she's logged in, but sees button that says go to my healthevet
 - Test account is confusing
 - Has more than just myHealtheVet stuff (make a payment, hearing aid, etc)
 - Scrolls down page looking for calendar
 - eventually clicks "Go to myHealtheVet" in the Scheduling section (note: she wanted to see her appointments not make one)
 - MHV tab opens; lands on MHV scheduling interstitial page
 -  she's confused here. thought she was going to view appointments page

- *What are the difficulties when trying to login? How far do they get?*

Ask:
- Was that experience what you were expecting?


## (Optional) Task 3 Health Care Hub - 5 min

*Navigate user to the Health Care Hub* *https://preview.va.gov/health-care/*

- *how would you get to Health Care Overview?*
 - Goes to megamenu, looks through items
 - Clicks on About Health Care to get to health care hub

- What do you think about the information on this page?
 - "Does this also talk about non-VA care?"
 - Scrolls through and skims text and links

- Do you think this would be useful to you?
 - It's only general information. Doesn't tell you who your provider is.
 - Now over to main VA.gov web site.
 - Don't see where you can do a means test.
 - Saw women, families, didn't see homeless (still on main, existing VA pages)

- Did you notice the contact numbers [DESKTOP: on the right side of the page] What do you think about this information?
 -


## Post-study - 2 min

Thanks for taking a look at the new site. We have two follow up questions.

- How did that compare to your past experiences with VA websites?
- If this website went live tomorrow, what would you want other Veterans to know?
