## Moderator Logistics

Conducting this study in-person onsite at VA medical centers. Logistics will vary based on site.

- For the Durham site visit we are planning two teams, one looking at mobile and one at desktop. Both teams will use the same guide.
- This guide is meant to be flexible for the moderator, due to time constraints with each participant please follow their interests.
- If the user attempts to access incomplete pages, guide them back to preview.va.gov.

## Warm-up - 3 min

Before we look at the new website, could you please tell us:

- What are some reasons you would visit a VA website today?
   - Visited eBenefits for medical records payment information
- Would you typically use your phone or a computer?
   - Haven't tried it on the phone, only desktop



## Task 1 Homepage - 5 min

*Navigate user to* *https://preview.va.gov*

Please take a moment to look at this new version of VA’s main website.

- What are your impressions of this site?
   - Overwhelming.
   - Doesn't seem that easy to use, but we will see.
   - I'm very computer illiterate and if it's too technical... I need it easy.
- What do you think of the layout of this page?
   - I like the layout. Everything for Education is under Education. Records... it's all there. Disability.
 - *If they don’t mention it, ask about the Veteran images*
- *If they don’t scroll down, prompt them to scroll down and give feedback*



## Task 2 Health Care Activity - 5 min

*Start from preview.va.gov homepage*

- You mentioned in the beginning that you would go online to [refill your prescriptions]. How would you do this on the website?

*We are interested in watching the user’s approach.*

- *What path do they use, HP link, navigation, etc?*

- *What do they say about the content pages or tool landing pages?*

- *What are the difficulties when trying to login? How far do they get?*

  - *How would you look at payments*
   - Disability top tasks, Clicked view payment history, landed on tools pages
   - Says she Would normally sign in to eBenefits.
   - [Internet froze]



Ask:

- Was that experience what you were expecting?



## Task 3 Health Care Hub - 5 min

*Navigate user to the Health Care Hub* *https://preview.va.gov/health-care/*

- What do you think about the information on this page?
   - I like the large print so I can see better.
   - It would help me a lot to have that a visible option (make print larger)
   - Scrolling down. I like this (yellow homelessness alert) because I was at risk of homelessness last month. I still am at risk but we'll see how it works out.
   - I like how you explain about the VA benefits (first spoke on page)
- Do you think this would be useful to you?
   - Yep. Especially, I have memory issue. If I forget the process this really helps.
- Did you notice the contact numbers [DESKTOP: on the right side of the page] or [MOBILE: under the connect with us menu at the bottom of the page]? What do you think about this information?
   - What I like is where you can talk online to VA, you can chat with them if you're struggling or whatever (talking about live, online chat?)
   - Would be nice if there was a way to chat online.
- *which number would you use*
   - I didn't know about the help benefits online.
   - I would call the help desk if I was having issues.
   - I did't know about the National Call center for Homeless veterans but I would give the a call.



## Task 4 Content Page or Tool Landing Page - 5 min

*Return user to one of the content pages or tool pages they visited in Task 2 or 3*

- *Went to Disability Benefits Eligibility*
 - "Wish I had that back in 93. It wouldn't have been so hard.""

- Please take a look at the navigation options on [DESKTOP: the left side of the screen]  
  - What do you think about the options in this menu?
  - Would you use this menu to navigate the website?
   - Yes. Very straightforward and easy to find.
   - Like that it explains the different eligibility things you can get benefits for.



## Task 5 Sign-in and Dashboard - 5 min

*Return user to the homepage -  preview.va.gov*

- Where would you go on this page to login to your account?
   - Went right to the sign in button (button didn't work, needed to click text)
   - Modal opens. She says she would sign in with DSLOGON (clicked that option)
   - Opened in a new tab to the DS LOGON page (on vets.gov)
   - Doesn't know her password, but says she would enter those and log in.

- *Prompt them to sign in if they can, if not use a production account to log them in*
  - *N/A*
- What do you think you can do here?
- What were you expecting to see?
- Do you find this information useful?



## Post-study - 2 min

Thanks for taking a look at the new site. We have two follow up questions.

- How did that compare to your past experiences with VA websites?
   - Much less frustrating than other websites.
   - Straightforward. I think it's a good setup. Everything is where it needs to be. Health is under health, Disability under disability.
  - *You said it was overwhelming, how do you feel now*
   - Not overwhelming at all. And no, I'm not jut saying that.

- If this website went live tomorrow, what would you want other Veterans to know?
   - **"It's a very useful source. Instead of calling a 1-800 number and waiting and waiting and waiting, you can get your payment info, your health care history. It's a very useful tool."**



## Thank you

We appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works for Veterans!

*Take them to participant questionnaire to collect information: https://adhoc.optimalworkshop.com/questions/2900-0770-wbc-durham*
