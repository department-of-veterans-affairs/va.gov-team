## Warm-up - 3 min

Before we look at the new website, could you please tell us:

- What are some reasons you would visit a VA website today?
  - MHV - renew prescriptions.
  - Theres not much else you can do. They say there is but you can't. You can find your appointments if you know what category to look for. MHV in my opinion is user friendly but 80% of the veterans are WW2, Korea, and Vietnam. I know enough to get in trouble. I've had a hell of a time with login. To find out after you've had a Drs appt or lab work done thats never posted and it should be, so there my experience with that
- Would you typically use your phone or a computer?
  - Both, mostly laptop

## Task 1 Homepage - 5 min

*Navigate user to* *https://preview.va.gov*

Please take a moment to look at this new version of VA’s main website.

- What are your impressions of this site?
  - It looks like a VA website.
  - *anything interesting to you?*
    -
- What do you think of the layout of this page?
  - *If they don’t mention it, ask about the Veteran images*
    - **On the health care page** They look like veterans to me.
  - *If they don’t scroll down, prompt them to scroll down and give feedback*
- The first step in getting you to track and refill your prescriptions. That didn't say that in the beginning. I would think that most people who look at a VA website would say how would it help me. The health care stuff is what I'm looking for. **I'm 80%, I'm just paid to 100%, that's the government.**
- Records now that would be nice if you could actually go to your medical records and go to them.

## Task 2 Health Care Activity - 5 min

*Start from preview.va.gov homepage*

- You mentioned in the beginning that you would go online to refill your prescriptions. How would you do this on the website?
  - I'd go right back to refill and track your prescriptions and then you'd have to sign in and create your account well all I need to do is sign in. Sign in with MHV is what I would do.
  - **MHV sign in button didn't work**

*We are interested in watching the user’s approach.*

- *What path do they use, HP link, navigation, etc?*

- *What do they say about the content pages or tool landing pages?*

- *What are the difficulties when trying to login? How far do they get?*



Ask:

- Was that experience what you were expecting?

## Task 3 Health Care Hub - 5 min

*Navigate user to the Health Care Hub* *https://preview.va.gov/health-care/*

- What do you think about the information on this page?
  - Scrolls through and reads. I'm already doing all of this. I use secure messenger also. Thats how I normally... thats how you have to get your prescriptions filled.  
- Do you think this would be useful to you?
  - sure.
- Did you notice the contact numbers [**MOBILE**: under the connect with us menu at the bottom of the page]? What do you think about this information?
  - Id be looking for how and where to contact them. I didn't see that.
  - Wait having all of that would be beneficial to me but I didn't have any help, I had to find out all of that on my own. They had like VA representatives, DAV representatives, I went through all of them and...I never got anywhere with the VA rep. I was applying for disabilities being a Vietnam veteran. You couldn't get anywhere with the VA rep. The only thing the DAV is good for is transportation. The American Legion representative became more like a friend. He walked me through everything. It took time. It went from 10% which I did on my own and went from 35% to 50% to 75% to 100%. It took 30 years from the time that I applied the first time. You get paid from the VA from that time that you apply, but they only went back about 2 years.
  - Found under connect with me.
- Would you call these numbers?
  - no. They put you on hold and say the next available. I was in Raleigh and drove all the way over here with my phone still on hold. Would call the health benefits hotline if I wanted to get through.  

## Task 4 Content Page or Tool Landing Page - 5 min

*Return user to one of the content pages or tool pages they visited in Task 2 or 3*

- Please take a look at the navigation options on [DESKTOP: the left side of the screen] or [MOBILE: under the more in this section menu].   
- What do you think about the options in this menu?
  - If I wasn't talking to you and I was trying to get in I would try it.
  - I've never done that before but I've refilled prescriptions online.
  - *Do you think you could refill prescriptions on here?*
    - No, because one is a a narcotic. *So you don't think you can refill them online?* No I don't think you can do that. The history for RX is on there, I've seen it
- Would you use this menu to navigate the website?
- More in this section:

## Task 5 Sign-in and Dashboard - 5 min

*Return user to the homepage -  preview.va.gov*

- Where would you go on this page to login to your account?
  - Prompt them to sign in if they can, if not use a production account to log them in*
- What do you think you can do here?
- What were you expecting to see?
- Do you find this information useful?

## Post-study - 2 min

Thanks for taking a look at the new site. We have two follow up questions.

- How did this experience on the phone compare to your past experiences with VA websites?
  - It was helpful, I'm sure it would be helpful to other vets. It needs to be easier access. When it first comes up it needs to have access and have the logon to not be so damn complicated. I understand that SRS (security) that it shouldn't be so case sensitive and they say don't use things that you know and it wouldn't have to be capitalized and lower cased and a number that they required now. People that don't know how to use a computer or aren't that computer savvy can't use it.
- If this website went live tomorrow, what would you want other Veterans to know?
  - Whether or not we can use it.

## Thank you

We appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works for Veterans!
