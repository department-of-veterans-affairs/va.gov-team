# Preview.VA.gov - Mobile, 10-15-2018, P4

## Moderator Logistics

Conducting this study in-person onsite at VA medical centers. Logistics will vary based on site.

- For the Durham site visit we are planning two teams, one looking at mobile and one at desktop. Both teams will use the same guide.
- This guide is meant to be flexible for the moderator, due to time constraints with each participant please follow their interests.
- If the user attempts to access incomplete pages, guide them back to preview.va.gov.

## Intro - 2 minutes

## Warm-up - 3 min

Before we look at the new website, could you please tell us:

- What are some reasons you would visit a VA website today?
  - MHV - renew prescriptions. 
  - Theres not much else you can do. They say there is but you can't. You can find your appointments if you know what category to look for. MHV in my opinion is user friendly but 80% of the veterans are WW2, Korea, and Vietnam. I know enough to get in trouble. I've had a hell of a time with login. To find out after you've had a Drs appt or lab work done thats never posted and it should be, so there my experience with that
- Would you typically use your phone or a computer?
  - Both, mostly laptop

## Task 1 Homepage - 5 min

*Navigate user to* *https://preview.va.gov*

Please take a moment to look at this new version of VA’s main website.

- What are your impressions of this site?
  - It looks like a VA website.
  - *anything interesting to you?*
    - 
- What do you think of the layout of this page?
  - *If they don’t mention it, ask about the Veteran images*
  - *If they don’t scroll down, prompt them to scroll down and give feedback*
- The first step in getting you to track and refill your prescriptions. That didn't say that in the beginning. I would think that most people who look at a VA website would say how would it help me. The health care stuff is what I'm looking for. **I'm 80%, I'm just paid to 100%, that's the government.**
- Records now that would be nice if you could actually go to your medical records and go to them. 

## Task 2 Health Care Activity - 5 min

*Start from preview.va.gov homepage*

- You mentioned in the beginning that you would go online to refill your prescriptions. How would you do this on the website?
  - I'd go right back to refill and track your prescriptions and then you'd have to sign in and create your account well all I need to do is sign in. Sign in with MHV is what I would do. 

*We are interested in watching the user’s approach.*

- *What path do they use, HP link, navigation, etc?*

- *What do they say about the content pages or tool landing pages?*

- *What are the difficulties when trying to login? How far do they get?*



Ask:

- Was that experience what you were expecting?

## Task 3 Health Care Hub - 5 min

*Navigate user to the Health Care Hub* *https://preview.va.gov/health-care/*

- Do you think this would be useful to you?
- Did you notice the contact numbers [DESKTOP: on the right side of the page] or [MOBILE: under the connect with us menu at the bottom of the page]? What do you think about this information?

## Task 4 Content Page or Tool Landing Page - 5 min

*Return user to one of the content pages or tool pages they visited in Task 2 or 3*

- Please take a look at the navigation options on [DESKTOP: the left side of the screen] or [MOBILE: under the more in this section menu].  
- What do you think about the options in this menu?
