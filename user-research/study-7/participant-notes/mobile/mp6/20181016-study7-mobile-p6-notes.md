# Preview.VA.gov - Mobile, 10-16-2018, P6



## Moderator Logistics

Conducting this study in-person onsite at VA medical centers. Logistics will vary based on site.

- For the Durham site visit we are planning two teams, one looking at mobile and one at desktop. Both teams will use the same guide.
- This guide is meant to be flexible for the moderator, due to time constraints with each participant please follow their interests.
- If the user attempts to access incomplete pages, guide them back to preview.va.gov.

## Task 1 Homepage - 5 min

*Navigate user to* *https://preview.va.gov*

Please take a moment to look at this new version of VA’s main website.

- What are your impressions of this site?
  - *Looking at healthcare:* Ok thats good. *Looking at secure messaging:* Ok that would be to your doctor. *View your labs:* yeah I like that
  - *Disability:* ok most of this doesn't apply
  - *Education:* thats something I'd like to do. I like that
  - *Records:* Yeah I like this. So all I have to do is click on the link.
- What do you think of the layout of this page?
  - *If they don’t mention it, ask about the Veteran images*
    - Far right: I think if this is like family support
    - I can't see what they are wearing but to me its active (?)
  - *If they don’t scroll down, prompt them to scroll down and give feedback*
  - I like the way it's laid out. It's touching on a lot of issues that I have. I like that its well laid out. 



## Task 6 Veterans Crisis Line Modal

- What do would you do if you were in crisis and looking for help on this website?
  - *Andy scrolled to top of page, past the blue preview banner to get started on task.* 
    - Immediately scrolled past the red banner, read through page content, scrolled down through page past zone 2. Found VCL red button in zone 2
  - *If they don't see if, point to the banner*
- *Prompt to read through the content*
  - What do you think this means?
    - It means that I would think that I had a friend that called me a lot who committed suicide that I would prefer to go this route to get help. That's just one example. 
  - What do you think you can do here?
  - What were you expecting to see?
    - Yes. That to me would be the first step to get help in an emergency. 
  - Do you find this information useful?



## Task 2 Health Care Activity - 5 min

*Start from preview.va.gov homepage*

- You mentioned in the beginning that you would go online to refill your prescriptions. Is this what you were expecting to see?
  - Yes because I haven't signed in yet. If I didn't have the option to sign in or create an account. 
  - I like that you don't have to go through all the time it takes to come down to the hospital and if I can do it online then you don't have to have an appointment.
- Where would you go to schedule a VA appointment when you're on this section of the website?
  - I know on the first section of the website I know it had schedule an appointment on the first block. (Goes back to homepage). Taps on schedule an appointment from homepage.
  - *Andy navigates to more in this section menu. Tell me what you think of this section:* Thats another thing, if I do something outside the VA system I want it to be part of my records and to update my information. 
- If you didn't already have VA healthcare, where would you go to find out about it (from the more in this section menu)?
  - Request a health ID card? If I wanted to sign up for healthcare for the first time... Get benefits? (Navigates here, questions eligibility, navigates here). 
  - (From eligibility page) *Is this what you expected to get?* It gives you the dates, it gives you information about what you're eligible for. 



*We are interested in watching the user’s approach.*

- *What path do they use, HP link, navigation, etc?*
- *What do they say about the content pages or tool landing pages?*
- *What are the difficulties when trying to login? How far do they get?*



Ask:

- Was that experience what you were expecting?



## (Optional) Task 3 Health Care Hub - 5 min

*Navigate user to the Health Care Hub* *https://preview.va.gov/health-care/*

- What do you think about the information on this page?
- Do you think this would be useful to you?
- Did you notice the contact numbers [DESKTOP: on the right side of the page] or [MOBILE: under the connect with us menu at the bottom of the page]? What do you think about this information?



## Post-study - 2 min

Thanks for taking a look at the new site. We have two follow up questions.

- How did that compare to your past experiences with VA websites?
  - This is a lot better. I need to look at it and read through it so I know it better but before I went on the website because I needed to put in information based on my health or exercise based on what I was doing on a daily, weekly basis and achieving goals that I was setting in addition to letting my doctor know so he could better administer health guidance to me. 
  - Oh night and day. You had a website and it wasn't as user friendly, it wasn't as near as user friendly. It was very limited to use the website because I actually tried to use it. This is far reaching. There is so much more you can do with it and I believe it will save everybody time and money and help veterans.
- If this website went live tomorrow, what would you want other Veterans to know?
  - Id want them to know that they have access to everything that they need, that they can find everything that they need and if there is something they can't think of but it looks like 99% better and it gives you answers of who to contact and what numbers to call.



## Thank you

We appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works for Veterans!
