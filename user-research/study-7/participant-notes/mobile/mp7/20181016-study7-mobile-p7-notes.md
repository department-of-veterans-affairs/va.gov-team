## Moderator Logistics

Conducting this study in-person onsite at VA medical centers. Logistics will vary based on site.

- For the Durham site visit we are planning two teams, one looking at mobile and one at desktop. Both teams will use the same guide.
- This guide is meant to be flexible for the moderator, due to time constraints with each participant please follow their interests.
- If the user attempts to access incomplete pages, guide them back to preview.va.gov.
