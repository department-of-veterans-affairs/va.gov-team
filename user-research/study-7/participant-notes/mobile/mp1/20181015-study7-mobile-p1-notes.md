## Moderator Logistics

Conducting this study in-person onsite at VA medical centers. Logistics will vary based on site. 

- For the Durham site visit we are planning two teams, one looking at mobile and one at desktop. Both teams will use the same guide.
- This guide is meant to be flexible for the moderator, due to time constraints with each participant please follow their interests.
- If the user attempts to access incomplete pages, guide them back to preview.va.gov.

## Warm-up - 3 min

Before we look at the new website, could you please tell us:

- What are some reasons you would visit a VA website today?
  - Get emails hyperlink to website 
  - Couple months ago was trying to check up on appointment
  - Medication - MHV
- Would you typically use your phone or a computer?
  - Laptop 

## Task 1 Homepage - 5 min

*Navigate user to* *https://preview.va.gov*

Please take a moment to look at this new version of VA’s main website.

- What are your impressions of this site? 
  - With your laptop you get everything at once. On mobile you have to scroll to find things
- What do you think of the layout of this page?
- - *If they don’t mention it, ask about the Veteran images*
  - *If they don’t scroll down, prompt them to scroll down and give feedback*
  - Its ok. Sometimes you know the page is more descriptive, this link is... I know this one time I was trying to find this specific thing related to the environment in Iraq and someone told me I had to go on the va website to find it and I had to click on this and click on that and it was so hard to find it. 
- *veteran images*
  - I think its pretty nice. Different veterans that come from different walks of life. 

## Task 2 Health Care Activity - 5 min

*Start from preview.va.gov homepage*

- You mentioned in the beginning that you would go online to [refill your prescriptions]. How would you do this on the website?
  - So right there--clicks in zone 1 to prescriptions
  - *what would you do next?* I would sign in but I don't have my information in. I know that this doesn't allow me to sign in. Every time you have to constantly log in. *do you use your browser to save your username and password?* Yes, but it makes you sign in every time. 
  - *go to that sign in button. Now where would you click?* I've never seen the option to sign in with MHV. Oh they are, they will be. I would probably go to MHV because I don't remember my DS logon, because thats one logon that I don't remember from the military. 

*We are interested in watching the user’s approach.*

- *What path do they use, HP link, navigation, etc?*

- *What do they say about the content pages or tool landing pages?*

- *What are the difficulties when trying to login? How far do they get?*

Ask:

- Was that experience what you were expecting?

## Task 3 Health Care Hub - 5 min

*Navigate user to the Health Care Hub* *https://preview.va.gov/health-care/*

- What do you think about the information on this page? Is this what you expected to see?
  - No. I thought it would be an article probably, like a description. This would allow me to go to access my information.  
- *Go to more in this section, tap health care link. Scroll down and tell me what you think on the information on this page*  Do you think this would be useful to you?
  - Thats pretty convenient. *tell me what you like about it.* You can apply, you can do appeals, you can access your prescriptions, you can access your primary care providers. 
- Did you notice the contact numbers [DESKTOP: on the right side of the page] or [MOBILE: under the connect with us menu at the bottom of the page]? What do you think about this information?
- Where would you go on this page if you needed help to contact VA because you had a question about health care?
  - I'm assuming manage your health care and benefits. *Scrolls through section.* I guess it would be one of these right? I guess not, I don't know exactly where to get help, this looks like I'd be able to. *Go ahead and scroll up for me on this page and click about VA health benefits. Scroll down a little bit for me, now tap the more in this section. Tell me what you think of the options in this menu.*

## Task 4 Content Page or Tool Landing Page - 5 min

*Return user to one of the content pages or tool pages they visited in Task 2 or 3*

- Please take a look at the navigation options on [DESKTOP: the left side of the screen] or [MOBILE: under the more in this section menu].  
- What do you think about the options in this menu?
  - This looks good. You have a lot of options in this menu.
- Would you use this menu to navigate the website?
  - Yeah I would use this. 
- Where would you go if you couldn't find an option in this menu?
  - Theres a search somewhere, right? I would go to search

## Task 5 Sign-in and Dashboard - 5 min

*Return user to the homepage -  preview.va.gov*

- Where would you go on this page to login to your account?
  - *Prompt them to sign in if they can, if not use a production account to log them in*
  - Sign in. *Now what would you do?* I'd go to MHV. 
- What do you think you can do here?
- What were you expecting to see? 
  - I was pretty surprised about that. 
-  Do you find this information useful?

## Post-study - 2 min

Thanks for taking a look at the new site. We have two follow up questions.

- How did that compare to your past experiences with VA websites?
  - Id say this is better. Its convenient. Everything is in one place. 
- If this website went live tomorrow, what would you want other Veterans to know?
  - They can go there and take care of things and VA will take care of them as opposed to coming up here [VAMC] and standing in line, they can do as much from home, that would help a lot of guys. I live in durham, so its not a big deal for me. Some guys travel a long way to get here 
- If you or a friend needed immediate help, where would you go
  - Its usually at the bottom, contact us
- Other thoughts?
  - Some help section to tell me some features of the website, since it's new

## Thank you

We appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works for Veterans!

*Take them to participant questionnaire to collect information: https://adhoc.optimalworkshop.com/questions/2900-0770-wbc-durham*
