### Things to Watch For - All
- We are concerned about the density of the HP, are they seeing all the links?
- What do users think of "View All" in the mega menu?
- Reactions to the HP blue ribbon with faces
- Does VCL pop-out, do they understand it?
- General use of the term VA as an adjective like "VA Health Care"

### Things to Watch For - mobile specific
- Does the footer work on mobile?
- Does the placement of the right-rail content still make sense?
