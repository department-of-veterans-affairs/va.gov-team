### Post-study - 2 min

Thanks for taking a look at the new site. We have two follow up questions.

- How did that compare to your past experiences with VA  websites?
  - You didn't have to screw yourself down into the program to find what you wanted to look at. It was pretty straight forward, there were 4 general sections. You could get where you were going a lot quicker 
- If this website went live tomorrow, what would you want other Veterans to know?
  - Not to be afraid of it. It's not intimidating at all. I think without a lot of knowledge about the website you can get to where you need to go.
