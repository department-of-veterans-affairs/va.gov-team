# Preview.VA.gov - Mobile, 8-27-2018, P3

## Moderator Logistics

Conducting this study in-person onsite at VA medical centers. Logistics will vary based on site. 

- For the Minneapolis site visit we are planning two teams, one looking at mobile and one at desktop. Both teams will use the same guide.
- This guide is meant to be flexible for the moderator, due to time constraints with each participant please follow their interests. Good starting points are Task 1 and Task 3. Tasks 5 and 6 can be done any time the users lands on a content page.
- If the user attempts to access incomplete pages, guide them back to preview.va.gov.

## Tasks

### Task 1 Homepage - 5 min

*Navigate user to* *https://preview.va.gov*

Please take a moment to look at this new version of VA’s main website.

- What are your impressions of this site?
  - One stop shop. Kind of what I'm looking at here. 
  - Here's what I got into when I got out of the army 3 months ago. I had to apply 3 months ago... I applied for Georgia or some other state. The guy here said that I had to do it again. A patient advocate tried to do it in person and sat me down in person and I don't know what the issue was applying online vs. in person...Its misleading. *assuming it's fixed, are you happy to see it here?* Yes. There's so much that I'm inundated with, make sure you check this and you're qualified for this, and it feels like its going to take a year to go through all of this. My wallet is full of cards of VA people. There is so much and so many va programs... you can get the information here or you have to branch off and go to these other organizations and programs to get this or that. I wish you could come in and scan your ID card and you can get access to all of this, you don't have to do anything. *so it's kind of like pre-enrollment or auto-enrollment* it should be auto-enrollment. There is so much money spent on all these different programs. I just gave 10 years of my life to the army and I just want to move on with my life. 
- Where would you go first?
  - Obviously healthcare, obviously thats the most important thing. Obviously the military does a lot to our bodies. A lot of this stuff is overwhelming. Another thing that I ran into with that, when you're getting out of the service, theres a class and its death by powerpoint and its not a 1-1 and everybody has their own needs... hc, education, disability. It just depends on their situation. I have a buddy and he wants nothing to do with the army and he gave a lot of this stuff up because of the way he treated them. He doesn't want anything which is bizarre... he's just like I don't want anything to do with them. We were together and he's that upset with it. So it depends on the person, everyone's needs are different. **I think anyone who is automatically injured in the line of duty should be automatically enrolled and you should be covered for life, just show up to your appointment.** So I don't think I will ever see that in my lifetime. 
- What do you like or dislike about it?
- Questions:
  - Anything legal? Legal assistance?

### Task 2 Megamenu - 5 min

*User can start this task from any location on preview.va.gov* 

Let’s take a look at the menu at the top of the page. *Point it out if they are searching for more than a few seconds.*

- What do you think about the options in this menu?
  - Benefits = benefits, healthcare = healthcare
  - About the va = stories, if you will
  - Find a va location 
    - I just thought id have to come here all the time, but there's actually a VA outpatient branch 5-10 mins from my house, it's really awesome actually. It really did help because I didn't know there was a va clinic in my area. 
    - Life insurance is the one I had a lot of questions about but I haven't received a lot of answers about
- What were you expecting to see?
- Would this be useful for you to navigate the site?
- Where would you go to [pick a task from their top reasons in the warm up]?

### Task 3 Health Care Hub - 5 min

*Navigate to https://preview.va.gov/health-care/*

Please take a moment to look at the new version of VA’s health care page.

- What are your first impressions of this page?
- What do you think you can do from here?
- Where would you go to [pick a health care task from      their top reasons in the warm up]?

### Task 4 Health Care Left Nav - 5 min

*Navigate to any content page under /health-care/*

Let’s take a look at the - [Mobile] “More in this section” link at the top. [Desktop] Navigation on the left side of the page.

- What do you think about the options in this menu?
- What were you expecting to see?
- Would this be useful to navigate health care      information?
- Where would you go to [pick a health care task from      their top reasons in the warm up]?

### Task 5 Health Care Content and Tool Pages - 2 min

*When user navigates to any content or tool page under /health-care/*

- Is this what you were expecting to see?
- What do you think you can do on this page?
- Where would you go from here?

### Task 6 Other Hubs - 2 min 

*When user navigates to any hub other than /health-care/* 

**Life insurance**

- Is this what you were expecting to see?
  - So you have your life insurance already as a servicemember but after a certain amount of time that goes away but we haven't really had a chance to talk to anyone about if it rolls over or if it goes away. 
  - *Can you try to find that information on this page?* Ok, so family and care benefits and services. (Navigates there) 
  - Get life insurance, that's pretty self explanatory. This is fine, if you understand the website. *what do you mean by that?* If you don't understand the lingo...the majority of the time, I want to sit in front of somebody and I would rather sit down and talk to them face-to-face especially for insurance or something that pertains to my family so that they can be taken care of...by the time you scroll through it its like commercials I don't have 3 hours to scroll through it. We don't have someone to walk us through it and understand these options. I understand theres no perfect system...If you guys are coming out from Washington and listening to our opinions we expect you to listen to us. 
  - *on a page like this, do you think that it requires the VA to have an in-person experience to guide veterans through this experience?* If you're going to have 20-something year olds but if you have older vets they're going to be like what the hell is this stuff? They're cranky already, they're not going to want to deal with this. They should have somebody they can call and help them. But again, that's more jobs. I'm either preaching to the choir or im preaching to the government. We should make it easy for our old vets. They should be able to come in and swipe it... they're already dealing with PTSD, they're already dealing with all this other stuff, why add all this other stuff. It's like a hoarder. But some guys can navigate through this stuff pretty easy. I have to have my wife or my 15 year old kid help me with this stuff. 
  - *If you can't have your wife or kid help, what do you do?* I call my VSO. If he's busy, I start calling around or I come down here. I write stuff down, I write questions down so I don't for get stuff because I live 45 mins away. I get all the reminders by phone, by mail, by phone calls. I start school tomorrow as a full time student. I love that. 
- What do you think you can do on this page?
- Would this page meet your needs?

### Post-study - 2 min

Thanks for taking a look at the new site. We have two follow up questions.

- How did that compare to your past experiences with VA  websites?
  - I'm still trying to figure it out. If you look at my phone I have like 15 emails that have to do with medical, legal, benefits, school, GI bill stuff, just all kinds of stuff that I have to click on because I've been so inundated with them so...[shows Andy ebenefits email]
- If this website went live tomorrow, what would you want other Veterans to know?
  - Definitely because if there is stuff out there to help us, even if I have the negative stuff because I need to take care of my family and I need to take care of myself. Learning is the best tool to help each other out. So you can kind of work together to wait for the government. Word of mouth. 
- Other feedback? Design?
  - I want it as simple as possible. Click a couple of things and qualify. Technology is suppose to make things easier. It's like a jigsaw puzzle. This is a crisis to me
  - *What do you think of these pictures?* As long as they are legitimate veterans, I'm all about it, otherwise take it out. 

### Thank-you

We appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works for Veterans!
