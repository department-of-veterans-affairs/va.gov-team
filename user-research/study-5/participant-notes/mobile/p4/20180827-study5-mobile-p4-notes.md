Moderator Logistics

Conducting this study in-person onsite at VA medical centers. Logistics will vary based on site. 

- For the Minneapolis site visit we are planning two teams, one looking at mobile and one at desktop. Both teams will use the same guide.
- This guide is meant to be flexible for the moderator, due to time constraints with each participant please follow their interests. Good starting points are Task 1 and Task 3. Tasks 5 and 6 can be done any time the users lands on a content page.
- If the user attempts to access incomplete pages, guide them back to preview.va.gov.

Post-study - 2 min

Thanks for taking a look at the new site. We have two follow up questions.

- How did that compare to your past experiences with VA websites?
  - Well, I haven't..I usually go on USA jobs. I want to see...now I'm looking for search...career and employment. I think this would probably the most important. When I get on there it would probably be to view vocational and employment. This is the kind of stuff I would be interested in. 
- If this website went live tomorrow, what would you want other Veterans to know?
  - I would tell them that it seems quicker. I don't know, I haven't put it to test yet because I haven't logged into my account yet. I just had a problem last week where I had to recreate another account just to get on there for them to send me a message to get a new password to change it. 
- Overall feedback, design?
  - It's a lot easier than actually coming in here
  - You know the old saying "hurry up and wait"...they want you to hurry up but you gotta wait

Thank-you

We appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works for Veterans!
