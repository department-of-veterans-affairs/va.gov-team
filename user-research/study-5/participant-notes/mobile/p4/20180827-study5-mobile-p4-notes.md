### Post-study - 2 min

Thanks for taking a look at the new site. We have two follow up questions.

- How did that compare to your past experiences with VA websites?
  - Well, I haven't..I usually go on USA jobs. I want to see...now I'm looking for search...career and employment. I think this would probably the most important. When I get on there it would probably be to view vocational and employment. This is the kind of stuff I would be interested in. 
- If this website went live tomorrow, what would you want other Veterans to know?
  - I would tell them that it seems quicker. I don't know, I haven't put it to test yet because I haven't logged into my account yet. I just had a problem last week where I had to recreate another account just to get on there for them to send me a message to get a new password to change it. 
- Overall feedback, design?
  - It's a lot easier than actually coming in here
  - You know the old saying "hurry up and wait"...they want you to hurry up but you gotta wait
