# Preview.VA.gov - Mobile, 8-27-2018, P2

## Warm-up - 3 min

Before we look at the new website, could you please tell us:

- What are the top reasons you would visit a VA website today?
  - Check medical record
  - File complaints
    - Experiences at facilities, patient advocate experience is better written than going in person to see the patient advocate
- Would you typically use your phone or a computer?
  - Phone (android) because health issues, but do have laptop that is close by

## Tasks

### B - Task 3 Health Care Hub - 5 min

*Navigate to https://preview.va.gov/health-care/*

Please take a moment to look at the new version of VA’s health care page.

- What are your first impressions of this page?
  - Very boring (colors, layout)
  - I have seen some other hospital pages that are more inviting. I think the colors should be more inviting. We can spend money on everything else, why not that. 
  - I think the letters should be more bolder. 
  - I think if you are going to highlight things why not women health care? Its not mentioned here
- What do you think you can do from here?
- Where would you go **to view your health care records?**
  - Where did I see that? I saw that somewhere...the big blue button
  - The first thing a service member is concerned about when they are looking at a va website at a hospital, the first thing they want to know is what type of clinics you have, they want to know definitely about the benefits which is on here, they want to know do you have family and caregiver benefits which is on here, but they also want to know what types of clinics which I don't see that on here yet. Now under this section I clicked manage your health and beneifts it says get va healthcare, it says manage your health--doe these make sense?--no, if I'm searching so I'm getting the history of the va hospital so if I'm looking next it says manage next so how am I going to manage my health if I don't really know if I'm approved for anything. So I need to know what the process is first before I can get to managing anything first. I'm a very analytical person...I like to go by the steps...I don't even know if I'm approved yet, this is implying that I got it already

### B - Task 4 Health Care Left Nav - 5 min

*Navigate to any content page under /health-care/*

Let’s take a look at the - [Mobile] “More in this section” link at the top. [Desktop] Navigation on the left side of the page.

- What do you think about the options in this menu?

  - Doesn't understand what this is for. Can understand the purpose of this from the menu or main page, but not from the medical records page.
  - You want to draw them in and help them out

- What were you expecting to see?

- Would this be useful to navigate health care information?

- Where would you go to [pick a health care task from their top reasons in the warm up]?

- Thoughts?

  - Would leave it like this--explains thoughts on this page (design specifically)


### A/B - Task 5 Health Care Content and Tool Pages - 2 min

*When user navigates to any content or tool page under /health-care/* **Records**

- Is this what you were expecting to see?

  - I think this sign in/create an account should be on top. I think a lot of people get lost with that. Especially an older person will get lost with that. They don't understand that first you have to create an account. I think this part should be at the top sot hat they understand that this is what they are suppose to be doing
  - You should have it so that it's broken down so that in order for you to do x, y, z... that again needs to be highlighted so that they understand that so that you get the extra oomph with that. Other than that I think it's ok. 
  - Again I think these things should be in bold. 
  - Make sure they understand that it's all free
  - And getting their medical records. Some people think that if they sign or request their medical records that they can request their medical records, but they still have to go downstairs and sign the release of information and get their records, that should be noted on here. You can print off your medical records, but to send them you still have to sign a release of information. 

- What do you think you can do on this page?

- Where would you go from here?

### Post-study - 2 min

Thanks for taking a look at the new site. We have two follow up questions.

- How did that compare to your past experiences with VA websites? 
- If this website went live tomorrow, what would you want other Veterans to know?
- Overall impressions?
  - Need women's clinics
  - Didn't see anything about MST because a lot of women and men went through that and the military now is making strides to assist with it. There are support groups and people need to know that the VA cares enough to highlight this information, feels like most people don't know about it because she didn't know about it when she got out of service
  - The emblem for the military should be on there, 5 branches. It should be a representation of all military branches.
  - Should be inclusive of LGBTQ community of the highlight for counseling information. Need to know that the military and the VA hospital 
- Other features would like to see
  - Medication reminders: would be great if VA had reminders to take meds
  - Doctor always asking how did you feel a week ago? Be able to track how you felt a week ago, 2 weeks ago so that you can track before your appointment so that you can remember and provide accurate information to your doctor
