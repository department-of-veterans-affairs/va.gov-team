# Preview.VA.gov - Mobile, 8-27-2018, P1

## Moderator Logistics

Conducting this study in-person onsite at VA medical centers. Logistics will vary based on site. 

- For the Minneapolis site visit we are planning two teams, one looking at mobile and one at desktop. Both teams will use the same guide.
- This guide is meant to be flexible for the moderator, due to time constraints with each participant please follow their interests. Good starting points are Task 1 and Task 3. Tasks 5 and 6 can be done any time the users lands on a content page.
- If the user attempts to access incomplete pages, guide them back to preview.va.gov.
