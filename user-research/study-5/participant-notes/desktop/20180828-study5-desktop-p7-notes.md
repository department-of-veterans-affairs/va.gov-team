**Participant 7 – Male - Atrium**

- Works at VAMC, goes to website many times a day, computer at work, iphone, Not a veteran
- Home page – previously there were more options at the top, scrolled to look at top task boxes, this is THE va home page, for politicians, public and everyone?  This is for the veterans, you’re presuming the veteran is knowledgeable and most are not, stylistically this is flat as it could be
- The current va home page is easy, you’ve made it harder
- How would you find this facility - I’d go to locations, clicked on top nav option, used facility locator, why is little falls cemetery the first option when I click on Minnesota, searched for Minnesota and got Brainard as first option, must be alpha, searched for Minneapolis then the Minneapolis clinic came up, that’s not good, that a homeless program clinic, vamc was second option, fort snelling va clinic is not a va clinic it’s a candp 
- Scroll to top, what do each menu options means – search function is lousy, contact us all looks fine, benefits and health care is pretty self explanatory its for patients already in the system the experienced user
- We have different web sites because we have different audiences and now we want to be the one thing for everyone?
- Clicked on health care eligibility in top nav, this page looks good, not too wordy, clicked on apply that looks easy and simple to do, used back button to go back a page
- Home page - I would like to see who are you, veteran enrolled, veteran, the public…
- How do you get back to the home page? - clicked on breadcrumb link, beta banner was confusing
- Current home page has crisis line above the fold 
- How does this compare to current – users don’t like change…I know where the stuff is and know how to find it. I like the fact hat is simple straightforward, negative is how to direct people with different interests and knowledge base, Eligible unenrolled veteran are out there , too often we hear I don’t need it give it to the other guy, how to convince someone who is eligible to get into the system?
- The crisis line is so critical, I would make that more prominent.
