**Female – Atrium**

Does everything online, primarily uses phone

Reasons to visit  - refills, look at upcoming appointments

Started on Home Page - Scrolled slightly to see all 4 boxes on home page, like how its grouped vs MHV, I’m actually looking for appointment system, I would go to schedule and view appointments, needs more color to segregate it, kinda looks like it blends together, for someone who has a harder time adjusting to new site, It doesn’t make me go wow

Directed to top nav - VA benefits are on top rather than on bottom like MHV

Asked to look for refill prescriptions - clicked on home page top tasks, Not what she expected, would have to adjust to it, looked to options on left nav

What can you do on this page (rx page) – read options in left nav, to refill her rx she would click the link in the left nav …of course I’m not signed in, if I was signed in I would expect to see my prescriptions

Directed to top nav , if you wanted to send a secure message where would you go - she looked to left nav and clicked the link, on secure messaging page scrolled down and saw green button, would go there

Where would you go to access info on your dis status - went to center of home page, I love that you have add a dependent…I’m stuck, if I wanted to see my disability rating…the only thing I think I could go to is review my payment history?

Navigated participant to the disability hub page - she asked how he got there.  I would be curious…as a veteran what can be garnished?  She would go under disability, give us guidelines on what can be touched or not touched. I like the layout of this

If this site went live tomorrow what would you like other veterans to know – I would encourage them that it’s a little easier to navigate. I noticed that you can log in at the top, versus MHV you have to go all the way to the bottom.
