### DAY 2

**Participant 1 – Male - Atrium**

Doesn’t have a computer at home because of identity theft, I use a computer at the shop or library

Started on Home Page

Scrolled down on home page, focused on top task area, you got everything on one page and just click what you want, Interested in disability, clicked on check your claim or appeal status

Moderator scrolled up, directed to look at main menu – 

Find a va location – if you know what state you are in…you can find out where the va is 

About va – tells you what the va does and programs they have

Benefits – what you qualify for health care and see what you have for benefits, opened benefits menu, that’s a lot of information, easy to look up

Where to find dd214 – records right here on the bottom

Where to refill rx – i’d click on the health care, user clicked on words Health Care in VA Benefits and Health Care menu label which closed top menu, found it on the home page

Went to rx page, used left nav to do rx refill, This is real easy

Top reasons to visit va site – to see what’s going on, what benefits or anything that has changed, trying to go to school right now for my job, I check [education info]

How does this compare – everything is one screen, all 4 areas, its more easier, It would make it more easier for veterans, its more informational, easier to find things.


**Participant 2 – Male (with female) - Atrium**

Uses some sites, has TBI, wife does many tasks; Both phone and computer, tablet too

Reasons to visit va site – to get appointments, sbp payments, benefits eligibility, contact info, bank account info, find a location

Health care hub page – read through options, general information about it, I’m assuming yep I could activate it (click on link),

Why are those numbers underlined, can I click on them (discussed mobile use to tap and call and loved that feature)

Need font larger, tired of hitting control plus plus plus

How would you refill rx – he went to footer under va resources, she considered programs and services, it’s a resource to me

How would you find your Medical records – I would actually hit the search, I would use search a lot; where would you go next, clicked benefits nav, found refill rx, looked at manage your health, looking for medical records, moved mouse down top nav options, stopped short of records and went back up 

If you couldn’t find it where would you go -  we’d look for a number to call

First instinct is to go to health care, If you put them in alphabetical order, in military everything is alpha or numeric order, didn’t see manage health care right away, trying to look in alpha order

Use secure messaging page – everything that we deal with the va are right here (looking at left nav on page)

How would you send a message – looked to left nav for type of message he wanted to send

I would assume we would log in before we got here

How would you get to the home page – scroll to the top and hit the logo

That page with the 12 things are what I do (referring to left nav)

I know to get my stuff I have to log in, I would look for a sign in, it would say HI Dan

How did this compare – I remember getting super aggravated [with other sites], but that doesn’t mean anything because of my tbi


**Participant 3 – Male - - Atrium**

Works at VAMC, goes to website many times a day, computer at work, iphone, Not a veteran

Home page – previously there were more options at the top, scrolled to look at top task boxes, this is THE va home page, for politicians, public and everyone?  This is for the veterans, you’re presuming the veteran is knowledgeable and most are not, stylistically this is flat as it could be

The current va home page is easy, you’ve made it harder

How would you find this facility - I’d go to locations, clicked on top nav option, used facility locator, why is little falls cemetery the first option when I click on Minnesota, searched for Minnesota and got Brainard as first option, must be alpha, searched for Minneapolis then the Minneapolis clinic came up, that’s not good, that a homeless program clinic, vamc was second option, fort snelling va clinic is not a va clinic it’s a candp 

Scroll to top, what do each menu options means – search function is lousy, contact us all looks fine, benefits and health care is pretty self explanatory its for patients already in the system the experienced user

We have different web sites because we have different audiences and now we want to be the one thing for everyone?

Clicked on health care eligibility in top nav, this page looks good, not too wordy, clicked on apply that looks easy and simple to do, used back button to go back a page

Home page - I would like to see who are you, veteran enrolled, veteran, the public…

How do you get back to the home page? - clicked on breadcrumb link, beta banner was confusing

Current home page has crisis line above the fold 

How does this compare to current – users don’t like change…I know where the stuff is and know how to find it. I like the fact hat is simple straightforward, negative is how to direct people with different interests and knowledge base, Eligible unenrolled veteran are out there , too often we hear I don’t need it give it to the other guy, how to convince someone who is eligible to get into the system?

The crisis line is so critical, I would make that more prominent.
