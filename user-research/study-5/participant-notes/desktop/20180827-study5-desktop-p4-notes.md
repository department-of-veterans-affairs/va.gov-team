**Participant 4 – Male- Atrium**

- Has used GI Bill, Uses phone primarily
- Started on HC hub
- Went immediately to top nav, looked through benefit options – pretty straightforward, expecting a little confusion, but this is easy, pretty much has everything I would be looking for, apply, eligibility, this would be a lot easier [to navigate the site]
- Edu hub – this is really simple, pretty much all the steps you need to do
- Went to top nav, health care, how to apply, clicked green button to apply, this is what I need to do today
- Home page - HC, edu and disability are the big ones, looks simple all the options are right there, need documents, that would be nice
- Compared to past – lots of clicking, at least 5 minutes to try to hunt down, this is better, lot more organized, makes it easy to find what you are looking for, its right there in front of your face
