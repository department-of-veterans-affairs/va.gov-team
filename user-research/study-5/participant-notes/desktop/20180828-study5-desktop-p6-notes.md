**Participant 6 – Male (with female) - Atrium**

- Uses some sites, has TBI, wife does many tasks; Both phone and computer, tablet too
- Reasons to visit va site – to get appointments, sbp payments, benefits eligibility, contact info, bank account info, find a location
- Health care hub page – read through options, general information about it, I’m assuming yep I could activate it (click on link),
- Why are those numbers underlined, can I click on them (discussed mobile use to tap and call and loved that feature)
- Need font larger, tired of hitting control plus plus plus
- How would you refill rx – he went to footer under va resources, she considered programs and services, it’s a resource to me
- How would you find your Medical records – I would actually hit the search, I would use search a lot; where would you go next, clicked benefits nav, found refill rx, looked at manage your health, looking for medical records, moved mouse down top nav options, stopped short of records and went back up 
- If you couldn’t find it where would you go -  we’d look for a number to call
- First instinct is to go to health care, If you put them in alphabetical order, in military everything is alpha or numeric order, didn’t see manage health care right away, trying to look in alpha order
- Use secure messaging page – everything that we deal with the va are right here (looking at left nav on page)
- How would you send a message – looked to left nav for type of message he wanted to send
- I would assume we would log in before we got here
- How would you get to the home page – scroll to the top and hit the logo
- That page with the 12 things are what I do (referring to left nav)
- I know to get my stuff I have to log in, I would look for a sign in, it would say HI Dan
- How did this compare – I remember getting super aggravated [with other sites], but that doesn’t mean anything because of my tbi
