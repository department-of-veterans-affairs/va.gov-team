**Male – Primary Care Clinic**

- Wife does all web and email tasks, he won’t use the site, his wife will
- First impressions – pointed at health care box on home page, wife orders stuff, refills are good, schedule and view appointments, lab tests are mailed to me don’t need that
- Like/dislike – records, can I get my living will attached to this site? 
- I would go to health care first, wanted to know what in education part, scrolled down to see, didn’t need most of the other items on the page – don’t need housing, already used education, had enough pension
- Directed to top nav asked where he would click first – va benefits and health care
- Not sure where he would go first, possibly life insurance not sure why – update your beneficiaries
- Took him to the life insurance hub page – interested in beneficiary content
