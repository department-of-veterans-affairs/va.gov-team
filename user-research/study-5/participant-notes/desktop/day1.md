### Day 1 

**Participant 1 – Male – Primary Care Clinic**

Wife does all web and email tasks, he won’t use the site, his wife will

First impressions – pointed at health care box on home page, wife orders stuff, refills are good, schedule and view appointments, lab tests are mailed to me don’t need that

Like/dislike – records, can I get my living will attached to this site? 

I would go to health care first, wanted to know what in education part, scrolled down to see, didn’t need most of the other items on the page – don’t need housing, already used education, had enough pension

Directed to top nav asked where he would click first – va benefits and health care

Not sure where he would go first, possibly life insurance not sure why – update your beneficiaries

Took him to the life insurance hub page – interested in beneficiary content

*Participant 2 – Female - Atrium*

Does everything online, primarily uses phone

Reasons to visit  - refills, look at upcoming appointments

Started on Home Page - Scrolled slightly to see all 4 boxes on home page, like how its grouped vs MHV, I’m actually looking for appointment system, I would go to schedule and view appointments, needs more color to segregate it, kinda looks like it blends together, for someone who has a harder time adjusting to new site, It doesn’t make me go wow

Directed to top nav - VA benefits are on top rather than on bottom like MHV

Asked to look for refill prescriptions - clicked on home page top tasks, Not what she expected, would have to adjust to it, looked to options on left nav

What can you do on this page (rx page) – read options in left nav, to refill her rx she would click the link in the left nav …of course I’m not signed in, if I was signed in I would expect to see my prescriptions

Directed to top nav , if you wanted to send a secure message where would you go - she looked to left nav and clicked the link, on secure messaging page scrolled down and saw green button, would go there

Where would you go to access info on your dis status - went to center of home page, I love that you have add a dependent…I’m stuck, if I wanted to see my disability rating…the only thing I think I could go to is review my payment history?

Navigated participant to the disability hub page - she asked how he got there.  I would be curious…as a veteran what can be garnished?  She would go under disability, give us guidelines on what can be touched or not touched. I like the layout of this

If this site went live tomorrow what would you like other veterans to know – I would encourage them that it’s a little easier to navigate. I noticed that you can log in at the top, versus MHV you have to go all the way to the bottom. 


**Participant 3 – Male- Atrium**

Army, Germany, Voc Rehab, worked at hospital

Started on health care hub

First impressions – noticed mental health providers, make or reschedule appointments

Sign in – I would expect my name to pop up, that’s how you get online, then I’d look for appointments

Clicked on How to apply for Health Care

Hasn’t’ been on a lot of VA web sites.

Interview did not get far, cognitive issues.


**Participant 4 – Male- Atrium**

Has used GI Bill, Uses phone primarily

Started on HC hub

Went immediately to top nav, looked through benefit options – pretty straightforward, expecting a little confusion, but this is easy, pretty much has everything I would be looking for, apply, eligibility, this would be a lot easier [to navigate the site]

Edu hub – this is really simple, pretty much all the steps you need to do

Went to top nav, health care, how to apply, clicked green button to apply, this is what I need to do today

Home page - HC, edu and disability are the big ones, looks simple all the options are right there, need documents, that would be nice

Compared to past – lots of clicking, at least 5 minutes to try to hunt down, this is better, lot more organized, makes it easy to find what you are looking for, its right there in front of your face
