# User Research Plan - for merger work

*Note: In the ever present debate about the need for formative vs summative user research, we are leveraging the research done to create the various websites (vets.gov, explore.va.gov, MHV, etc) as the formative stage. We are focused on evaluating and validating key questions and prototypes to move the merger project forward.*

## Study 1
- Research Question: How do Veterans organize the "other" resources that do not fit neatly into the service oriented buckets (like disability, housing, etc.). Examples of these resources include Veteran ID card and Welcome Kit).
- Format: Open Card Sort, Digital, Unmoderated
- Recruiting: MHV mailing list, Facebook
- Participants: Veterans, Family, etc

## Study 2
- Research Question: How do Veterans think about the benefit cycle? Examples include "Explore, Track, Manage" and "Explore and Apply, Manage"
- Format: Closed Card Sort, Digital, Unmoderated
- Recruiting: MHV mailing list, Facebook
- Participants: Veterans, Family, etc

## Study 3
- Research Question: Which of our wireframes concepts works best for Veterans? What are the pros/cons of each?
- Format: User Reserach, paper prototype, In-person moderated
- Recruiting: Site visits
- Participants: Veterans

## Study 3b
- Which of our revised design concepts works best for Veterans?
- What are the pros/cons of each?
- What do Veterans think of the revised top task approach?
- What do they think of the look and feel?
- What do they think about the two CTA button layout options?

## Study 4a
- Research Question: Does a consolidated Veterans-first navigation work?
- Format: Tree Test, Digital, Unmoderated
- Recruiting: MHV email list + VSO Comms Support
- Participants: Veterans, VSOs, VA Employees

## Study 4b
- Research Question: Does the simplified version of the mega menu work?
- Format: Tree Test, Digital, Unmoderated
- Recruiting: MHV email list + VSO Comms Support
- Participants: Veterans, VSOs, VA Employees

## Study 5
- Research Question: Does the new "merged" design work for users? Can they find what they need using the HP, Nav, and Hubs?
- Format: Usability Test on interactive prototype in dev, Mixed, Moderated
- Recruiting: Site Visits, VSOs, possibly remote testing
- Participants: Veterans, Familiies, VSO, VA Employees


## August - September Study Planning
- will navigation it perform on mobile? will they be able to navigate easily? needs to be in person on mobile devices. we can use preview link. does the mega-menu still make sense when its collapsed down into an accordian. can they quickly and easily find things. 

Priorities
- should we split the Study 5 group desktop/mobile or do 2 studies?

Homepage
- with all the content do people actually see the links on the HP?
- How does a user going to About VA play out with the top nav and getting back
- get some feedback on the "view all" where the get to the hub and drill into content
- how do they interact with the mega menu? can they find things that arent in there.
- make a payment in HC, education forms might be good examples.
- pictures of Veterans in the ribbon.

Risk - is the mega menu going to work for VA teamsite pages? may screengrab and build out some of these pages as a backup.
Risk - cant do much live testing on the hub pages until everything is really hooked up

- mobile footer as well (in a task). 
- VCL is a top priority, we need to make sure this works on mobile, can they find this easily. 
- placement of hub page right rail content on mobile. is this content important to them?

Tree tests - More in-depth testing on the content of each hub
- burials
- education
- health

Menu, HP, Hub
qualitative approach for pension/records/disability issue.

accessibility research - reach out to a11y folks. readers and cognitive aspects. we've added a lot of volume to content and making navigation more difficult. work with Trevor Pierce. 
- plan a study to see the editor workflow through GH or Teamsite. talk to content editors and identify the pain points in their current workflow.
