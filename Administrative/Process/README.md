# Tracking support work 

## Pull requests reviews

- **Product managers**: for each team, track pull request reviews in a new epic each sprint 
  - examples: _Tools and Improvement VFS Support - Sprint 5, Triage VFS Support - Sprint 5_
  - close the epic at the end of the sprint- this will remove it from the drop down list making it easy for engineers to know which epic to tag 
- **Engineers**: upon completing a pull request review, add your team's support epic to the pull request review 
  - you will need the [ZenHub Chrome Extension](https://www.zenhub.com/extension) to easily do this on the pull request page
