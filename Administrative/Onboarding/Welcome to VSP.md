# Welcome to the Veteran Services Platform (VSP)!

You are here to build online experiences on VA.gov that will improve Veteran's lives. VSP is here to give you to the tools, systems, and guidance you need help you do that. As you develop your application, weâ€™ll be your support team helping you through the VA.gov ecosystem, best practices, and processes - including the iterative cycle of ideation and strategy, user testing, launching code, and measuring results.

## What is VA.gov?

The website serving as the single place Veterans can go to find, apply for, track, and manage the benefits they've earned.

## What is a VFS Team?

You are! VFS stands for Veteran Facing Services. Any sprint team building online Veteran-facing experiences is a VFS Team.

## What is the VSP?

The Veteran-facing Services Platform (VSP) is the common infrastructure, technical and non-technical components, and processes that support static and interactive content consumed by Veterans via VA.gov. Major pieces of the VSP include a set of APIs that manage communication between a Veteran user and internal VA resources, an identity and authentication system, a design system based on the U.S. Web Design System, reusable frontend components, a Drupal-based content management system, and an extensive set of documentation and guides.

## How should VFS Teams expect to interact with VSP?
