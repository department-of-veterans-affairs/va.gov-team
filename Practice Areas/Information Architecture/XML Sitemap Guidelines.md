# XML Sitemap Guidelines

An XML sitemap is an SEO tool that helps Search Engines find and index pages on the site faster and allows them to use our "crawl budget" effectively. 

The XML sitemap should only contain pages deemed to be quality landing pages that we would want to show in search results. It essentially tells search engines that the pages listed are our most important pages.   Leaving a page out of the XML sitemap does not mean that search engines will not find it or index it.  If search engines can find the page through links into it, it will still be indexed.  The XML sitemap just ensures search engines can find our most important pages.  


Examples of what to include:
- Optimized, quality content pages that we want to rank 


Examples of what not to include:
- Pages behind authentication
- Pages that may be useful to users, but are not meant to be landing pages (i.e. privacy policy, login, contact us, etc)
- Error pages
- URLs with parameters
- Pages marked "noindex"
- Paginated pages
- Redirected pages
