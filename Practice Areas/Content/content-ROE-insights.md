### Questions and feedback on the Content Review document

Feeback and questions from meeting with VSA PMs: 

1. Can we add request a content review from within a pull request? Or does it always have to be in an issue? 

--Yes, teams can request a content review in a pull request. I've updated the ROE to reflect that. 

2. Is there a plan in place when you're OOO? Would someone else be doing the final Content Q/A support? 

--TBD. need to discuss with platform team. 

3. Should we be using the ```content``` or ```content-ia-team``` label when creating a Content Review issue?

--For final content Q/A review, please use content-ia-team label. 

4. Are there any resources you could share with the global-ux content team about how to create a Github branch and pull request? 

--Yes, I'll be providing a training to the global-ux content folks week of 8/26

5. We'll be reaching out to the global-ux team for our content writing needs, should we include you on those issues or just when we need a final review? 

--As the global-ux team is still working Github and druapl access and traning. I let the PM know that she can cc me on issues while that team is getting access and onboarded, so I can provide support as they need. 


Peggy notes/observations from meetings: 

All the teams will be getting content support from the global-ux team, as the product teams don't have an embedded content writer/editor. The PMs asked how my role fits in with those content folks.  Might need address this in the content doc to avoid confusion on product teams. 

I let them know that I will be providing final content Q/A during specific times in process (as outlined in ROE), but am available to provide support anytime they need. The global-ux team would be their first line for content writing needs.
