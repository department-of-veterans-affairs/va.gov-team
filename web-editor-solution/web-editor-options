# **VA.gov Content Editing Options**


Option 1: Use TeamSite to generate a JSON document
We would build a form(s) in TeamSite that content editors can use via the TeamSite GUI, then weâ€™d connect the data from those forms to our code in GitHub. We would define workflows within TeamSite that allow for rapid deploy and assign the appropriate people to those flows.

Developer LOE: Extra Large
End User LOE: Small

| Risks | Rewards |
--- | ---
TeamSite has a significant learning curve; our developers will need to learn how to build TeamSite forms and templates as well as how to generate a JSON document | End users do not have to learn anything new
Team would need a dedicated OIT resource that can give us their focus | Edits are published immediately (inside 5 minutes)
Sophia is currently only team member with TeamSite access | Easier integration with VA.gov
