Test cases to assign folks at bug bash.


Unicorns Products have all been tested but this is a good opportunity to take another spin and make sure they're all fully functional. Feel free to add to the table below to capture additional elements as this one is pretty straightforward. We're keeping this lean, the idea here is to run through the key functionality again for positive cases just to make sure nothing has been broken during any recent changes.
