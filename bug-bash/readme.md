- If you're on a Mac, screen recording using QuickTime is very easy!
- [Licecap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) is a great gif capture tool, and gifs will animate directly in a GH issue, no need to download them.
- Qsnap is a great chrome extension
- If you are checking for bugs on mobile, government issued phones disable screen recording and screenshots
