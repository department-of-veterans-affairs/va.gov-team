    - These include unauthenticated products like On-site Search or authenticated products like Disability Claims (526).
  - "Usage" is a transaction of the tool completed by a user 
  - This does not include content products like the Benefit Hubs or Resources & Support.
- **Percent of applications submitted online (vs. paper)**
  - “Applications” are any VA.gov product with an offline/paper analog that delivers a benefit or service to Veterans OR non-Veterans.
  - These include unauthenticated products and authenticated products like Education Benefits (22-1990).
  - “Submitted” means the online application is successfully accepted by a back-end system/database of record for processing. It does not mean a decision has been made on the application.
- **Benefit use and enrollment, across all business lines**
- **Number of VA.gov users as a function of total Veteran population**
  - These users are segmented by Veteran OR non-Veteran and by Level of Assurance (LoA).
