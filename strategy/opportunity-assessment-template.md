# Opportunity Assessment Template
#### Overview

<details>
 
*OCTO-DE pursues opportunities to improve the Veteran experience. These opportunities vary in size and scope and their alignment with DE's strategic goals.*

*Because DE people and teams interact with many conversations, artifacts, etc., this template's job is to make it easier for the product org to surface, assess, and decide whether to pursue a particular opportunity.* 

*For that reason, the Opportunity Assessment is a useful communication tool and should be considered one of the first stops on the journey of an idea to improve Veteran lives.*
